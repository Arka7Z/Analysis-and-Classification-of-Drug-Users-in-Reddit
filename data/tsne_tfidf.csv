15.346428,23.631777,Addicted,so i was catching up with psychedsubstance earlier and got the idea that smoking dmt would be a fun time tonight now a few important notes of background im taking a low dose of the antidepressant venlafaxine so i didnt know how much the deems would affect me i had also done a lot of mdma the night before which sorta worked in weird ways and i had smoked two fat bowls of weed earlier in the day anyway i totally eyeball a dose at a guess it was maybe around 60mg and take one huge toke which i hold in for as long as possible i blow out the window of my bedroom but apparently this isnt good enough because the smell stinks out our entire house im definitely feeling it i go and lie down on a soft bed and fold inwards experiencing lots of wonky dimensions and flashing psychedelic colours morphing into pulsating fractals it is only a few minutes into the experience when my dad comes into my room asking about the smell i sorta just look at him and shakily murmur a few words not quite sure what i said im seeing his face rippling with ever changing iridescent colours i flop down and cuddle up to him for a bit which he thinks is pretty weird but goes along with it and then he leaves a few more minutes pass and then both my mum and my dad come in asking about the smell i just look up at them and tell them plain and simple that im smoking dmt its an incredibly powerful hallucinogen and i didnt mean to stink the house out they both ask if i feel alright i say yeah im fine and then i tell them what the experience is like i even ask if either of them want to do it my mum looks quite tempted but in the end they pass and leave me to it they honestly were fine with it they thought it was quite a funny situation and said that as long as i was safe it was all cool maybe just go in the garden next time though i ride the rest of the trip out becoming one with the blankets and mattresses i even go back to finish off the bowl and lightly trip a bit more then i guess i went on reddit to rake in upvotes lol
-23.733137,0.54271245,Addicted,yes this isnt a standard rdrugs post but ive been on this sub for a year now and seen a fair amount of posts about kids getting caught with drugs by their parents i just read a post about a person whos dad is a cop and caught them with weed so now their dad doesnt know what to do and says he will enforce police dogs to make sure there child is out of trouble you gotta realize that your parents have seen a lot more than you have in their days my dad is very anti drugs and hates me smoking weed but thats because he grew up and saw alot of his friends go down dark roads of hard addiction so he doesnt want me to do that because he cares about me i may be mad at him but i realize its out of the good of his heart yall need to see that too if your mad at ur parents try to see it from their perspective your parents care and love you guys dont give up on them trust me no drug is worth more than family because family will always be one phone call away when u need it no matter where u are in life edit oh man i just checked this for the first time today and thanks alot guys for my first gold really brightened my night your parents love u guys and those in hard family situations just hang in there hopefully something good will turn up

-10.904216,10.323951,Recovered,one of the key things to remember when doing drugs is that you have to be able to walk away from doing those drugs even if it’s just smoking weed if you can’t take a break from doingusing then you aren’t doing drugs you’re addicted to them sometimes you gotta take a break to remind yourself that it’s a choice and remind yourself why you’re making that choice drugs are for making good moments even better not for making bad moments bearable you have to feel the lows to enjoy the highs you have to recognize that sobriety isn’t something to escape bc if you spend your life trying to avoid sobriety then you aren’t allowing yourself to enjoy life at its essence

5.0139074,-7.301198,Addicted,pls no hate for the title but i was diagnosed as autistic 5 years ago i would engage in repetitive actions for hours at a time did not know how to engage socially had no idea why people did the things they did a year ago i started taking shrooms every weekend starting at 2 grams then 1uickly increasing up to 6 to 10 depending on how i felt because of this dedication to every weekend i sometimes had bad trips due to bad set and setting and life getting me down i think that the autistic need to follow a routine forced me to continue and im glad it did during these trips i began to understand why people did things i realised how social interactions worked and what i should do when people did certain things i think that the bad trips i had were by far the most helpful despite how horrible they were replaying every social fuckup ive ever made for 6 hours in my head analysing their thoughts and emotions seeing their body language and playing different scenarios through helped me find ways in real life to approach situations as time went by i slowly grew more and more social and more understanding of social circles and well less autistic its like my brain had swallowed all the information i needed to be a normal human being and hidden it at the back and taking shrooms regularly formed pathways in my mind that allowed me to access these corners and in doing so shrug off the weight of autism or at least suppress it from every person i met knowing immediately to now some of my closest friends being shocked when they found out i just thought id share with you guys and maybe inspire a few others to try this out its been life changing for me and im so happy i did it and want to help others live a more normal life

10.03716,1.1845359,Recovered,if i had just fixed my tail light… i still would have driven the same route i still would have let my friends light up in my car for the first time in 7 months i still would have missed the exit forced to get off at the next i still would have driven past the cop at the same time same place only 2 blocks away from my destination but if i had just fixed my tail light… the cop would not have looked twice just another car on the road “obeying” the law he wouldn’t have stopped me and found out where i was from 75 miles from home on his streets at 1am he wouldn’t have caught the scent of herb and had probable cause but if i had just fixed my tail light… i still would have picked up ecstasy and had a terrible hiding spot there would still be mushrooms in the trunk hidden in my duffle bag and there still would have been a half ounce of weed in the trunk with a small bag inside the car but if i had just fixed my tail light… my car would not have been searched and the weed inside would not have been found the passengers would not have been checked and the ecstasy would not have been uncovered i would not have been put in handcuffs right there on the spot or be thrown in the back of the cop car as i watched my girl be cuffed too i would not have watched him pop the trunk and find the rest if i had just fixed my tail light… i would not have spent the night in the town holding cell waiting for the judge at 8am i would not have been escorted to the smalltown courthouse across the street with shackles on my hands and feet i would not have had that old angry judge tell me i am a criminal and set 10000 bail if i had just fixed my tail light… we would not have been picked up and brought to the county prison i would not have spent all day with the man who hit his wife the kid barely older than me in there for the third time on charges of robbery to feed his addiction or the man driving without a license and an unregistered firearm if i had just fixed my tail light… i would not have stripped naked and put on the prison uniform in front of correctional officers i would not have tried getting sleep on a cold metal shelf they call a bench while shivering and thinking how badly i fucked up this time i would not have eaten soggy white bread with hard “chicken” and shredded lettuce as my first meal in almost twenty hours i would not have been forced to touch my lips against the shitty fountain to suck the water out so i could wash down the meal if i had just fixed my tail light… my divorced parents would not have come together to bail me out i would not have seen that look in my father’s eyes… disappointment anger fear frustration orders of magnitude worse than all of the times i had fucked up before “you just ruined the rest of your life” forever echoing inside my head if i had just fixed my tail light… friends would not have been lost due to court battles over possession my entire life savings would not have been emptied i would not have dropped a semester of college my reputation would not have been ruined but if i had just fixed my tail light… would the love of my life just have been a casual hookup with a friend would i have realized how much i really needed her and cared for her she is everything to me and i can’t picture life without her all of our beautiful memories of the past five and a half years may never have happened if i had just fixed my tail light would my days be an endless blur of blunts bongs and bowls like they were before would i have continued spending time in my brother’s room with him and his friends as they moved from roxys to heroin and been right there along with them would i have gotten caught the next time i picked up a large quantity of mushrooms and have to serve jail time instead of five years probation if i had just fixed my tail light would i even have a relationship with my parents today or my sister the sober sibling or would i still have spent all my time among countless “friends” would i still have chosen a new major and taken school more seriously would i still have been the youngest of three siblings yet the first to get a bachelor’s would i even be in grad school right now if i had just fixed my tail light there have been too many sleepless nights wondering what could have been what should have been but the “what if’s” are the worst what if i got off at the correct exit what if we had better hiding spots what if i stuck to my rule of no smoking in the car but the one that nags me the most the one that i think about every single day the one that set off a life changing chain reaction because of pure laziness what if i had just fixed my fucking tail light the day before all of this a friend driving behind me told me my light was blown and i figured i’ll just fix it some other time at 19 i thought i was invincible but i had to learn the hard way it has now been five and a half years since that day and i am a completely different person than i was back then if i could go back in time and just change that light bulb i’m still not sure if i would

-2.6656902,1.1905801,Addicted,i just blew my mind edit this is my first thousand point submission yet earns no karma fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu 
24.63394,13.889881,Addicted,disclaimer this is not typical acid use there are many concretely beneficial effects from lower more infrequent doses in 2014 i did on average 250ug of acid once a week for ten months from january to october or approximately 40 times doses typically ranged from 150ug600ug i assume i never knew for sure how much i actually took subjective experiences ranged from slightly glowing colors to complete loss of any sense contact with the physical world around me and a 10 minute orgasm at one point i had the ability to i had savings i lived in a house of accepting camgirls real life wasnt getting in the way the first thing people usually want to know is why nobody gets addicted to acid its unheard of when people trip they stay generally keep the fuck away from it for several months it can be a very overwhelming experience noncommunicable and utterly alien i did it because i felt like i was learning every time i tripped i had the overwhelming sensation that the doors had opened and i was mainlining information from a direct source of truth every time i stopped tripping it felt like those doors closed and i forgot most of what id learned but i wanted to remember so i kept doing it again and again higher and higher doses i needed to know i produced arturl i played music when we imagine frequent drug use we imagine it as a form of escapism  that real life is too difficult that we want to shut down for a time acid was exactly the opposite it heightened senses heightened what i was aware of in my own mind let me explore the way my own thoughts formed it took what i was and shoved my own face in it i couldnt look awayurl there were times of deliberately induced and absolutely excruciating emotional pain to which nothing in my regular life has ever come close i did it on purpose i needed to know it is very difficult to talk about the things you learn while tripping because it occurs while in such a deeply altered state that language ceases to apply it really is more about a way of looking  a very specific type of engaging in experience thinking about the experience defeats the point because thinking about it is not the same thing as having it applying words to the experience is misleading by nature it is the concept in math where defining a thing gives it an outside and an inside and thus you can never define the thing that is always outside  in giving it a term in identifying it with boundaries it is no longer what you are trying to say the tao that can be named is not the tao it is the unspoken the mu as time went on i stopped viewing myself as a being separate from the universe sensations became interesting to watch not motivating i entered such a permanent state of utter peace and contentment that i stopped wanting anything at all and by the end of it i barely got out of bed barely ate i had stopped working almost entirely and was living off slowly depleting savings why would i work why would i do anything i was not happy not sad i simply was i was free of desire i did not fear death and ten months in i realized thats what i was looking at  death i would compulsively whisper i am dead under my breath throughout the day i was an empty vessel and i realized that if i kept doing acid i probably would die out of sheer apathy i wasnt terribly worried  but i had to make a decision did i want to continue down this path knowing the end was oblivion or did i want to close the doors and return to the world of the living i chose the latter  not due to any compulsion or survival instinct at least not subjectively  but because i casually figured living would be more interesting the journey back was almost as strange and beautiful as the journey in as my motivations slowly began returning i found all i wanted was to forget whereas before i was trying to immerse myself in the knowing now i was constantly attempting to shut eyes that were permanently pried open no matter where i turned the knowledge had been seared into my brain it was like that feeling you get when you watch a movie and are suddenly aware that just out of the frame there are camera crews standing around the actors and you stop buying into the story because all you see is the movie set i just wanted to pretend this was all real i wanted to feel invested in myself i wanted to feel upset insecure proud happy anxiety anything i wanted to stop knowing here is a poem i wrote during that time periodurl lots of people have been making fun of this poem i am feeling insecure and want to take it down but instead am alleviating my worry about what you think of me with a disclaimer that it was personal and came from my journal so dont have high expectations before i chose life i didnt mind the deep nothingness i had sunk into  but after the choice was made it became not uncomfortable but strange i felt like i had abandoned an old lover like this constant twinge of pain like a splinter in my throat i couldnt dislodge i thought constantly about tripping again and being reunited i did acid in my dreams over time almost without me realizing it the eye slowly eased shut like going to sleep i started to find myself caught up in moments of investment i started to feel insecure again annoyed and it was shitty and amazing it took about another ten months for me to return to roughly where id been when i started im mostly normal now with only a few remnants sometimes certain types of conversations will trigger it where im sitting there and suddenly the eye of the universe has turned on me and i am melting away it is very intense i dont mind though thats a fundamental part of the feeling really  that i dont mind when its happening i feel like ive pulled the wool over my own eyes ive bought into this world it is profoundly comforting in a way so subconscious its difficult to identify its as though at all times behind my ears there is a powerful belief whispering its okay when i get locked out of my apartment when debt collectors call when my mom tells me she found a lump in her breast  its okay i chose this i am full i am held i am not afraid anymore and when i am its because fear is interesting because i have the privilege of feeling it my underlying motivation now is to convey this awareness to others or feel as though i have it seems like the most important thing the only important thing and so here i am edit if you want to read more details and analysis of my experience go hereurlonacid    an elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path he wasnt sure of which direction to go and hed forgotten both where he was traveling toand who he was he remembered absolutely nothing he suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him she grinned toothlessly and with a cackle spoke now your third wish what will it be third wish the man was baffled how can it be a third wish if i haven’t had a first and second wish you’ve had two wishes already the hag said but your second wish was for you to forget everything you know she cackled at the poor man so it is that you have one wish left all right he said hesitantly i dont believe this but theres no harm in trying i wish to know who i truly am funny said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever that was your first wish unknown author if you know who let me know so i can give credit edit various rephrasings formatting and an embarrassing failure of month calculation  another edit a lot of comments are saying it made you feel like you understood but it was just tricking your brain this is not implausible  a lot of people do acid and get utterly convinced of silly things but i want to make two points one that information gained from the use of drugs is not automatically invalid if you have two brains one which was structured for a lot of reflection and one that wasnt and you fed the second brain a chemical that made it similar to the first brain would the reflection it undergoes be invalid two that the feeling of knowledge is something we get every day anyway from school from authority figures from our own minds piecing things together what separates acid knowledge from regular knowledge is that acid knowledge tends to be about things you cant prove or easily communicate this puts it more in the same category as god  maybe its real maybe its not but we have no way of accessing it really its a few levels above god people frequently report psychedelics as one of the most meaningful events in their lives it has been shown instrumental in treating anxiety depression and endoflife fear there are measurable benefits from the outside its just very hard to talk about subjective sensations for example  how would i describe a new color to you if youd never seen it i couldnt no matter how hard i tried to talk about it i might sound absolutely insane you might call me delusional but if you had seen it you would know exactly what i was talking about

23.757545,0.18830013,Addicted,i’ve been addicted to opiates for about 6 years but for the past 3 years i was an iv heroin and meth addict and i got high everyday and when i say everyday i mean everyday i also went to a methadone clinic for the first year i had a good job and was able to afford it but i eventually lost my job which led me to doing all kinds of things to make money  and many i’m not proud ofi know i’m a shitty person for doing these things  and i know its wrongi’m 5 months clean off heroin and meth so i no longer do this stuff but i just want to tell my story on how i mostly supported my habit  some may find it interesting  every so often my mom would give me a little money here and there but definitely not enough to support the habit i had  so i had to come up with ways to make it myself  the most easiest way i made money and what i did the most  was simply driving my best friend around  i dated this girl about 6 years ago  but we figured out we were better just as friends and we both got strung out on drugs together  she was the first person i injected drugs with  i’m 21 and she’s 28 as we got bad off in our addiction she became a prostituteshe lived with her father in the ghetto and had 2 kids  during the day from when they got out of school and until they went to bed around 9pm she was usually at home with them but from 9pm until 700 am when they had to catch the bus is when she worked  i would take her on outcalls all night long  and the deal was  we keep gas in the car  keep cigarettes and the rest goes on heroin and we split it 5050  she didn’t do meth  just heroin  she charged 160 an hour  120 for a half hour  or 80 for a qv 95 of the calls were qv’s a qv stands for “quick view” and it basically means  just long enough to make the guy cum so in most cases a qv only ranged from 515 minutes no longer for us it was the best deal because she could knock them out really fast  and we could get a half gram of heroin for 80 and that was enough to start us out for the night  if we didn’t have dope you could talk her down to 60 for a qv and if we were dopesick she would do it for 40 but that was rareit’s definitely happened a few times  but only if we were desperate  we always mixed all the heroin up together and split it between two syringes  she usually got anywhere from 310 calls a night  3 would be a slow night and 6 would be an average night  and 10 would be a good night most nights we would make around 200 being the lowest 400600 being normal and 1000 being a good night  we’ve made 2000 a few nights  but that was very rare  luckily we never had any trouble with the police did have alot of sketchy dealings though  i never went dope sick when i was rolling with her  we might of woke up dope sick  but it didnt stay that way for long  for some reason  people don’t do much during the day time  it would be pretty rare for her to go on a call during the day time  it was mostly always from 2am5am some days she wouldn’t have good luck and we’d have to do other things  there’s been many occasions where we would wake up sick  and have no money or anything  in those cases i would drive my car from gas station to gas station and ask people for “gas money” i was very good at talking to people  and selling my storyof course not everyone gives you money  but for the most part  i was always able to get what i needed  out of all my friends  i was the best at doing this  because i’m pretty quick on my feet  i’m able to look people right in the eye and tell them a 100 bullshit story not stutter one word and make them believe it i mostly sold the same story everytime”i’m almost out of gas  left debit card at home  do you have 1 or 2 dollars i could have for gas  or even any changei’m just trying to make it home anything counts” there’s small things you can do to ‘sell your story’ like look for change in your car while your talking to them carry a gas jug etc depending on the person  the story would vary  but to make it short that’s it  i could always make 40 in 2 hours max  but most of the time within 1 hour  that’s all we ever needed was just 40 if i didn’t feel like begging  because it’s degrading and somedays i just wasn’t up for it  i would go to walmart  my golden rule was to never walk out with something you didn’t pay foras long as you paid something there is a box of vitamins in walmart that are 34 for one box  and there is another kind that’s the same brand name for 4 i would peal the barcode off of the 4 box and place it over the top of the 34 box barcode and go to the self checkout  hell sometimes i would go to a regular checkouti’ve never been caught doing this you can return anything to walmart without a receipt but you must have an idyou can get a cash refund for any item under 40 and anything over 40 you will get a gift card  i would buy a box for 4 and take it to another walmart and return it for 32 as long as somebody had their idyou can only do it 3x a month but i always got a friend or somebody to return it  if you have a receipt you don’t need an id so when i didn’t have an id i would find a receipt for something around 30 in the parking lot  go in and put a cheap barcode over the top of the items barcode buy whatever it was for around 35 and return it with the receipt and get cash back  if i needed a bunch of money  i would go to the fishing pole section  and get a 100 fishing pole  and peel the barcode off of a 15 pole  and put it over the 100 poles barcode  return the pole at another walmart and get a 100 gift card  and then go to the walmart gas pumps  and find somebody that would pay me cash to pump their gas for them  it’s kind of lengthy  but i could earn a couple hundred bucks a day doing that  it sounds goofy replacing the barcode  but it’s just wayy easier to get caught actually stealing something  than it is to “buy” it  i’ve done this hundreds of times and never have been caught once but you can’t be obvious about it  and you have to be slick  or you will get caught we ate fast food everyday and 75 of the time we didn’t pay for it  i’d call and tell a restaurant i came last week and got such and such  and was missing one burger  and that i was coming for a replacement  i’d always tell them that i called back that same day  and talked to somebody and they wrote my name downgive them a fake name  you can only ask for one burger thoughif you get greedy it won’t work the trick is  you have to be confident  and talk to them like it really happenedyou can’t be sketchy  or iffy about it  you just have to be able to talk fast  and make them actually believe iti was great at thisit would work 710 timesevery time we did pay for food  we kept the receipt  so when we called and fed them the story  we could actually have a receipt and then it would definitely work we survived off of this  of course we pawned all of our stuff of any value  and did a lot of middle manning  but these are just a few stories of some of our schemes that people don’t usually hear about  i know all this is shady stuff  and i’m ashamed of itand i know it’s wrong  but desperate times call for desperate measuresa hard drug addiction will make you do some terrible things  you’d never do in your right mindthere’s no need to comment on here and tell me i’m a piece of shit lowlife junkie  because i already know that i just figured a lot of people would be curious how a lot of junkies are able to make money on the streets for drugs without a job  and this is how a lot of them make ita lot of people i know and hang around with do these same things most of my friends like robbing houses and stealing and robbing people for drugs but i never liked taking things from somebodya multimillion dollar corporation yeah i don’t care  but as far as breaking in a persons house and taking all their stuff and robbing people for their dope nah i’ve been ripped off before  and i’ve worked a hard labor job for almost 4 years so i know how it is to work hard for something and then have it stolen from you  and it’s the worst feeling i don’t do shit like thati could easily make more money by breaking in houses and cars and robbing people for dope  or “robbing tricks” which is what a lot of prostitutes do  but i just wasn’t okay with doing thathope y’all enjoy 
9.278493,-1.8004596,Addicted,i spent more than a few years using a variety of substances mostly with the honest intention of escaping the confines of my own mind i smoked weed for the first time when i was 12 but didnt begin using it regularly until i was 14 heavy daily user until 19 throughout high school i drank way too much way too often though i was always down to do or try anything i had access to  shrooms lsd cocaine every pill fathomable  everything except for my three personal standards never try meth heroin or crack i started off my drug use career by hanging out with dealers some of my best friends early on were selling pot ecstasy and pills  so basically i had access to those three throughout high school at any point and time i only used coke two or three times until college but i never really liked it at all adderall and cannabis above all else were my preferences heres where the story gets interesting at 18 i started dealing previously my friends had been low level distributors  selling pot by the gram or eighth smoking away the profit with yours truly i genuinely liked these people not for their drugs but moreso because they were openminded and interesting through these friends i met other friends eventually meeting some higherup suppliers and people with whom i could intellectually relate to and connect with more by 19 i was selling weight mostly it was just pot but also sheets of acid  mushrooms occasionally and molly sometimes for a month or two it was ounce by ounce but eventually i linked up with someone with whom i had serious business chemistry and the rest is history i wont specify the amounts of weed that we were selling just to be safe but know that i was making roughly 1000 a week and use your imagination to fill in the gaps at this risk of sounding haughty or arrogant we were running our town one of our plugs once informed us that we were the only teenagers hed ever seen that could do what we were doing and admittedly it was an awesome thing to hear i was always safe i used burner phones to communicate with plugs and different burner phones to communicate with clientele i never let anybody know how much i had at any given time except for my partner as we would pick up together to get great deals on bulk product my partner was far less safe he had a genuine love of people and he loved that friends flocked whenever he rolled up for me it was solely about the money i never pulled out my bags in front of others unless id prebagged less than a quad for personal that being said had the police kicked in my door on any given day during this year long period i would have gone to prison i brought one of my childhood best friends in on the operation someone with no previous drug experience because he had considerable value in that he had a lot of money he wanted to make more money and he had access to a large market of unexploited buyers this was one of my biggest mistakes he grew familiar with the plugs and often said their names out loud in mixed crowds mostly i think because it feels good to be on the inside when everybody else is trying to peek in through the windows he took an innumerable amount of risks and put himself and us on blast many times but i loved him nonetheless and eventually his girlfriend made him stop anyway down the road when im middleaged it will be beneficial to have someone verify my unbelievable stories my partner and i were under investigation for the better part of a year the police didnt have any controlled buys on us and they didnt know who our plugs were  we were too careful my partner however was selling to people who we both knew were hot people who had a reputation for snitching and frequent run ins with the police i would tell him to stop connecting with these people noticing that every time he did our heat would increase cop cars parked by his house at all times both of us getting followed by squad cars when we drove etc however his autonomy got the better of him in that he fucking loathed being told what to do and hed tell me to stop trying to be his dad someone who he frequently hung out around us snitched on him not one of our distributors but rather just a third party who had a cool spot which we frequented the police pulled him over when he was riding with a friend on his way to work and the person driving didnt say anything but regardless the police found a couple ounces on my partner with individually bagged grams and about a thousand dollars cash he caught four felonies and a misdemeanor that day had the police pulled him or i over a day earlier we would have gone to prison and the felonies would have been far more extensive all in all he got very lucky it was the best time of my life and i continued on for a little bit but eventually i decided to stop smoking weed daily had prohibited my mental and academic maturation to such a degree that one day i had a 10 hour panic attack about the direction my life was headed in i quit smoking that day and i told him that i was changing and i wanted him to move on with me he agreed but he said that he wasnt ready to move on he didnt want to change yet it was a very selfaware thing for him to say to this day i dont regret it i made so many friends had so much fun and took so many exciting risks ive got insane stories to tell my kids when theyre adults and i gained more valuable and unique life experiences during this time of my life than any other it was a blast i made a shit ton of money and i learned a lot about business as well as the psychology of marketing these days my goal is to become a practicing doctor its something ive always wanted but i didnt believe that i was capable of it until i quit smoking weed and really started to maximize on my minds potential when i quit smoking my grades went from ds and fs to as for the longest time i thought weed made me better i thought it made me more comfortable with myself but really it just made me more comfortable with complacency i wasnt depressed anymore when i was high but at what cost i didnt care about anything at all my future was going down the shitter my best friend fucked up his record and none of the friends id made were really all that interesting all we had in common was a desire to get fucked up and have fun i have a highly addictive personality perhaps some can use cannabis infrequently and not squander their potential in any way i think the problem with weed is how we talk about it people most often dont use cannabis like they use alcohol  rather smoking all day every day becomes the norm and you begin to lose sight of what being sober even feels like after all how can you know which lifestyle you prefer if youve spent years without experiencing the opposite in my experience the people who say that cannabis isnt addictive and isnt harmful are the same people who cant quit smoking for more than three days at a time and the likelihood of them quitting for three days is even slim in summary fucking around was the best time of my life and ultimately i wouldnt take any of it back however at a certain point you need to ask yourself where you want to be in 5 years 10 years etc trying out sobriety doesnt make you less interesting it just means youre openminded enough to question the behaviors that youve let define you  even if you let them define you because you were just being openminded if you lose friends well thats often just a part of growth you have to surround yourself with people who believe in who you are not just what you can offer them i wish the younger version of myself had known that the real rebellion against normalcy is to challenge the growth of your mind and that doesnt come through suppressing your thoughts and emotions to the point that you can barely feel anything at all above all the worst thing that we can ever become is complacent do i see myself ever smoking again maybe once ive accomplished all of my dreams and aspirations but having quit for some time now i just dont see myself starting up again it really took a toll on my mind just know that when youre feeling pain heartache depression anxiety and other symptoms of sadness it means that youre a human the ability to feel things and to decide on a reaction is what makes us human and more you suppress that the less unique you become take my advice have fun while you can and enjoy your youth but when you begin to contemplate the risks youre really taking and whether or not youre wasting time that you might never get back dont suppress those feelings i did for over a year embrace the ability to question yourself and grow peace and love

20.265696,10.986342,Addicted,i was 17 years old and studying engineering at the university of toronto it was saturday the previous night i had been at a wild student halloween party i woke up late hungover smelling like tequila and still in my soccer referee costume with a whistle around my neck this comes in later i didnt get a chance to change my clothes or charge my phone because i had to meet my team for a design project afterwards my best friend hit me up and said he had shrooms we met up and went to a starbucks across the street to get some boiling hot water then used the washroom of one of the nearby campus library to brew it into a shroom tea this way we could walk around campus and sip on our shroom tea and people would think we were just drinking starbucks coffee by the time we finished our shroom tea we were in the common room ripping some smash my phone had died completely i was still dressed up as a referee we continued walking around campus and the shrooms were slowly kicking in we went to hart house some hogwarts lookin building at uoft and went to this really old church inside with squeaky wooden floors and shit it was completely empty so we sat down on the fronttmost bench and i just let my mind go and let the shrooms take me at first it was small distortions like the lines between the wooden pannels waving and sliding there was this coloured glass window of jesus ahead of me and above eventually i dont know how long later i would see the glass start to crack then time reverse and the glass go back to being solid over and over again in a steady rhythm kind of like clanks time abilities in ratchet  clank a crack in time yep now i was tripping balls and on top of the hallucinations my thoughts dude what the fuck we had a conversation and logically concluded that we were characters in a digital reality video game like nerve with dave franco obviously we had a couple of grams of kush with no way to smoke it our mission to find a way to smoke the weed we enetered the options menu and set the difficulty to max we arent allowed to buy anything and we arent allowed to ask npcs for help you read that right and off we went on our journey onto the streets of downtown toronto looking for smoking apparatus i dont remember much of the walk only key highlights i remember walking through china town and it was like i stepped through the twilight zone and ended up halfway around the world i fondled the anime tiddies on some perverted phone case in one of the many small stores we visited i remember we walked past a rehab and there was this young beautiful but illlooking blonde chick in a wheel chair and in one of those hospital gown things smoking a cigarette and yelling at us i cant remember what she said i fell in love with her for a good portion of the walk my brain was racing at a million thoughts per second i thought of how she must have been an innocent teenager like us with a future then she probably odd or something then ended up there i had to save her from rock bottom and love her and we would start a family ashley and our beautiful son don the loves of my life at least until my bladder which i forgot existed the entire trip started screaming at me to empty it i pissed on some graffiti no fuck ashley and don were on a mission we need to smoke eventually we gave up on trophy hunting and turned the difficulty down to normal we tried buying backwoods but everyone carded us it was late we were desperate we saw two npcs vaping in an alley we turned the difficulty down to easy and approached them the older looking man and woman were giving us odd looks do have backwoods what the fuck guys do you have high tea leaf  were on shrooms and we need a blunt the woman grinned and said to the man lets take them up they led us to an isolated door man motioned to a staircase inside it was long and very tight  wed have to go single file  and led into what appeared to be the abyss he went in and my friend without hesitation followed the sketchiness of the situation must have triggered fight or flight mode or something because it felt like all the adrenaline from being scared shitless had countered the shrooms snapped me back into reality i was still seeing distortions but my thoughts and logic felt normal again i wanted to run but i couldnt leave my friend behind i couldnt yell for him either the lady behind me gave me a shove and i went in she shut the door behind her the walk up those stairs felt like the longest walk of my life it got darker my heart turned into a fucking jackhammer both of our phones were dead no one knew where we were not even we had any idea where we were or what time it was i was about to be raped robbed abducted andor murdered he led us to another door and brought us inside inside were a bunch of older people wasted out of their minds hey everyone we found these guys on the street theyre on shrooms lets show them a good time eh my friend and i looked at each other and gave each other our what the fuck is going onn duuuude look i started to calm down and the shroom high started to kick in again as people passed us beers and were yelling singing and dancing just having a good time in general also everyone kept asking us if we had any more shrooms thats when we knew wed fit in here i was still in my referee costume and some people called me ref others called us the shroom guys those were my names for the night we went out onto the balcony where some guys were already smoking weed we used their pipe and smoked ours mission accomplished i let out the smoke of my first puff in a sigh of relief now i get to enjoy the endgame we chatted with the two guys outside with us who also asked if we have any more shrooms lol and gathered that this was a bachelor party they were from a small town 3 hours away and came down here airbnbd the place for entire week and were on their 5th day of the 7day bachelor party they were all friends with the groom we asked if we could meet the groom to congratulate him and they warned us that hes really fucked up at the moment and pretty much constantly since the party started just as they said that a man stumbled face first onto the glass sliding door he took off his pants did a hand stand and pressed his ass against the glass at us his name the groom then everyone clapped we stayed there chilling at the party for 4 or 5 hours lots happened we drank with them smoked with them partied with them sang and danced and i had some nice conversations with a couple of people my friend is working towards becoming an electrician and the groom had already been working as one for years so they talked a lot about the field there was a bedroom where everyone would go and rail some coke when the previous hit went away though i didnt partake since i had used at a party a couple of weeks ago and exercise extreme discipline with how frequently i use uppers i think i broke a couch by accident cant remember or maybe it was already broken before i fell on it no one cared anyway i recall that i got dogpiled on by some guys on the couch afterwards at one point i was leaning on a wall near the washroom door a big hairy guy with just boxers on came out and slapped my ass you ever been fucked before boy i bet youd like it too he said as he brushed up against me and slapped my ass again i was still tripping and was also drunk and baked at this point i had no idea what was happening or what i should do i just stared at him with fear in my red bulging eyes you think that little whistle will save you boy you think anyone outside will hear that little rape whistle of yours he said as he fondled my whistle i let out a nervous laugh and peed a couple of drops in my pants my friend was no where in sight he laughed out loud too and slapped me on the back then we both just started laughing out loud and slapping each others backs he didnt end up raping me and was actually a pretty fun guy to party with i vaguely remember some guys telling us they were part of a gang and showing us their matching gang tattoos on their wrists they grabbed sharpies and gave us temporary matching tattoos too and hailed us their first ever honorary members i was pretty fucked up at this point but i know something along those lines happened cus i woke up with it later a lot more happened but the memories are kind of blurry and it would take hours to type out the minutes of a party that long i clearly remember how i was feeling though i had the time of my life but was also in utter disbelief the entire time i was alice in wonderland we left late in the middle of the night after thanking everyone profusely for showing us a great time especially the man and the woman that brought us up and wished the groom the best of luck with his marriage we left started walking asking for general directions from the few people out at the time and making our way home we stopped at a 24 hour korean grill on the way and did the all you can eat thing where they give you raw meat and seasoning and you have to cook it yourself at the table the shrooms were no longer active and the weed and booze was calming down as we stuffed ourselves and had a conversation recalling the entire night starting with when we got the boiling hot water from starbucks we shared what each of us were up to separately at the party and went over the different thoughts going through our heads during the rest of the night which we did share you can imagine how hard it was to explain what my mind was going through when we walked past the rehab chick to this day he still gives me shit about falling in love with ashley i still love her and after going through all this shit together on top of all the other crazy adventures weve shared i love my bro even more
9.235604,11.548169,Addicted,brought over from rdmt because my account is less than 6 hours old this is my first reddit post and i dont really frequent this site much i have auditory neuropathy which means my ears would work if the neurons that brought the sound to my brain worked but i have lesions covering my auditory nerves that got worse as i grew older i am 19 and ive never heard a thing ive always been sort of rebellious when i was 8 i took cigarette butts out of the adults ashtrays and smoked em up 12 i smoked weed for the first time and by the time i was 16 i have had plenty of psychedelic substances under my belt i am by no means experienced with these substances and i have only tried lsd and shrooms when i was 18 my life changed and i witnessed the universe speak with my own auditory cortex d my friend had stumbled into a pile of cash and wanted to hook people up with some good experiences he asked me first of all people to try some of the whitest dmt hes ever seen i knew what dmt was but ive only ever heard about it lol so obviously i said hell yeah i show up to his house and hes got some trippy tapestry up with a bunch of cool lamps and uv lava lamps twas a sight to behold we sit and he tells me why he wanted me to try dmt he tells me he read a story on the internet about a blindfrombirth person who did dmt and saw he saw stuff his underdeveloped visual cortex was no match for the dream drug he wanted to see if i would be able to hear the dmt ringing as some call it was a far off fantasy but i thought what the hell he loaded about 50mg into his vaporizer and hands it to me i take the biggest hit i can hold it for as long as i can let it out and go for a bigger hit the second hit exiting my mouth is all i can see as i fall and warp into colorful oblivion the smoke fills my headspace and all i can feel is an energy binding the smoke to my eyes i am still deaf at this point as the smoke clears a distinct unknown feeling fills my head it felt like vibrations in my fucking head you know when a bass bumps and you can feel that shit deep inside you it was like that but not in my body i could hear it the pitches changing the frequency getting lower and higher i could hear dmt made me hear and i havent been happier since i wept with joy at the beauty of sound it truly is a wonderful thing thank you for reading

20.38616,9.747577,Addicted,hey guys so this happened a few days ago and i’m currently at work tryna sink some time so i thought this would be a funny experience to share tldr at bottom a week ago i was chilling with my mates for the weekend while they spent their experience rolling since i had dxm a few days before this and was worried about the interaction i decided to abstain and thought it best to obliterate myself with bud booze and sad tunes to drown out the saltiness of wanting to roll so badly with everyone it was a great time regardless and we all had fun on all kinds of different vibes i still brought my bag to my friends place containing 400 mg of molly lowkey hoping my drunk and high impulses would get the better of me accidentally on purpose i’ve never done more than 200 mg in a night usually 100 with a 100 booster but i always bring extra incase others want to indulge woke up the next day with the baggie still in my pocket well fuck if it wasn’t the most bitter sweet feeling in the world realising even in my most inebriated and numbed out state i’m still paranoid and anxious about potentially ruining my mental health how ironic this turned out to be fast forward a few hungover hours later i head home and walk to the top set of stairs of my apartment building only to see 2 fully clothed police officers knocking on my door full fight or flight mode kicks in i’m done neighbours caught a whiff of some shit and dobbed me in zuckerberg had personally sent my messages with my plug to the police himself maybe i was just too reckless with my habits and couldn’t cover my tracks well enough whatever the reason i flip the fuck out judge jury execute myself and decide i’m going to prison because fuck logic anxiety becomes physical cold sweats all over tingles start shooting down my spine and radiate throughout the entirety of my physical being like a bat signal of “you’re fucked” that my brain is conveying to my body my heart feels like it’s wrapped in shrapnel and it’s trying to beat itself out thinking about my whole life crumbling to dust because of the decisions i’d made leading to this point for what for some god damn molecules time felt like it literally froze while all of these thoughts conjured themselves in my consciousness within the span of a second i turned around ran down my staircase and toward my garage area savouring every last despairingly long breath i had as a free man frantically remembering the m i had in my pocket in my manic state i did what every anxiety ridden paranoid drug fuelled mongoloid would do at the sight of boys in blue and i ate the fucking bag they caught up pretty quickly since it’s only a short walk to my garage before they start asking me who i am why i was running etc trying to painfully mask the fact that i had just dry swallowed 400 mg’s of mandy including the plastic under the guise of being ‘nervous bc police’ which wasn’t entirely false i explained to them that i lived there and i had just forgotten something in my car and was going to grab it they keep a close eye on me and verify my details before they explain that there had been a massive incident a street away from me and the perpetrator was last seen hopping the fence to my complex they were asking neighbours incase there were any witnesses the baggie had torn when i chewed it all up in my mouth and they weren’t capped straight crystal form i spent around half an hour talking to police and by the time i got upstairs i was already out of my fucking mind high vomiting was futile at this point i kept getting higher after several attempts to puke so i decided to ride it out considering i wanted so badly to roll for the weekend anyways and this was my form of ‘punishment’ unto myself i spend the next 5 hours literally and i mean literally uncontrollably orgasming and screaming at the softness of the blankets i human burrito’d myself in while listening to music riding out the most intense roll of my fucking life eye wiggles up the wazoo hallucinations so real they made schizophrenia seem like a vacay jaw looking like i’d just been sucker punched undertaker eyes the whole 9 yards but god the euphoria the fucking euphoria bar my first time i don’t think i’d ever felt so content just being in a room with myself and my thoughts ended up being a very productive roll and worked through some really personal shit that had traumatised me in the past ironically enough helped me realise how anxious i truly am and how quick i am to jump to conclusions when shit perceivably hits the fan it’s been almost a week now and it’s the first time i’ve had any kind of extensive comedown i’ve done m semi regularly every 4 months with some exceptions for the past few years now too mood still much noticeably lower than usual and my fucking vision just won’t seem to stop blurring itself out ever so slightly when i look around or read sometimes especially in one eye shit is fucking annoying i’m thinking these symptoms are hopefully related to the amount i took and is acute and not a sign of me stroking out a part of my brain affecting my vision for good but only time and maybe an mri will tell i exercise frequently meditate daily rest well and eat as healthily as possible i cannot even begin to fathom what some people feel and go through for their comedowns not doing all that other shit so fuck me right tldr saw cops at my door coming back from friends house carrying a bag of m in my pocket panicked ran away ate bag realised cops were there for unrelated reasons rolled absolute balls and think i killed part of my brain now
9.077354,-2.3138123,Addicted,i can now say ive lived both sides of the fence for 35 years i was the picture of a square having never touched any illicit drug aside from alcohol caffeine and sugar you know the ones the government can make money from my career path put me in a position where drug tests were commonplace and the clearest head possible was essential to the high intensity of my profession cyber intelligence  international law enforcement related work among other public activities and duties there was no room to fuck up i had to be the perfect picture of an abused poor black kid from a small town with a big iq who never touched drugs and proved that the system was there to help kids like me become made men and was groomed by the best of the best who took pity on me by 26 i had met colin powell among various world leaders and sat in command posts scifs  situation rooms with every 3  4 letter agency you can imagine my life was an open book i was involved heavily in church working with children had a charity under my belt and i was the success story that religious and civic organizations loved to parade around as inspirational however i was also openly battling depression suicidal ideation selfharm and complex post traumatic stress disorder on and off for the majority of my early life alongside having been diagnosed as having a high functioning aspergers at some point in the adventure the periods between symptomatic relapse and peace varied with life circumstances and i continued to give of myself to anyone who needed help as part of what i call my kamikaze mission i was not taking care of myself until i was in crisis at which point i would crash from months or years of running on nothing but pure warrior will power booze and adrenaline i was proud of myself but hated myself at the same time that guy in his 30s with a brand new porsche who worked 1020 hours a week sometimes while traveling on one end of the spectrum and then didnt leave his house eat or shower for 100 hour hacking sprints fueled by porn  hookup breaks whiskey and a desire to die for a cause ugly cycle but i always said  hey at least ive never touched drugs like you losers see my success is due to me being clean i was a douchebag i was arrogant i hated myself i did not know love naturally i was a wreck of an empty human to be in a relationship with to any woman i ever slept with or dated i am so incredibly sorry i was nothing more than a movie character playing the role i thought i was here to perform and not really living then it happened my dad who i had met maybe 10 times in my life died in prison at 70 years old for raping an 11 year old girl my family had hid the fact he was even alive from me for 8 years apparently i was present when he shot and killed my uncle in front of me as he was trying to molest me the memory is there but i dont go there ever following this my brother committed suicide he never had a funeral i fell in love with an equally as fucked girl from hawaii who was married and broke up with me  by having her friend text me on her birthday so at 35 years old i had endured 2 wives 2 abortions without my consent 1 miscarriage by a girlfriend who was a meth dealer and perhaps 90 women under my belt at this point i am realizing i am a wreck my life is a sham i am better off dead so at 35 i decided i had lived an amazingly full life done shit people only dream of or see in movies im good im done i give up i planned on taking my life as a conscious and mindful resolution to my story i told my estranged mom  family friends pastors clients everyone my intention was not to be talked out of it but to go out heroically i think i thought there was something romantic and dramatic about doing it so thoughtfully and with discipline that would give my life  all the bullshit i had been through purpose deciding to die was the best decision i ever made i wrote my bucket list had an insane amount of money available to me thanks to part ownership in a startup that made me a millionaire on paper  funny how that works out later  and was able to work anywhere in the world there was internet funny thing that i noticed about my bucket list drugs i had never even once smoked weed not even a puff i could count the number of cigarettes i had ever tried no coke no ecstasy despite spending years in the rave scene i was a complete virgin so i decided hey im gonna throw a big party and sip nembutal cocktails for my last night on earth might as well try this getting high thing before i knock off right i booked a bunch of plane tickets all over the world and set a rule that i would only touch natural or relatively safe drugs  psychedelics this was my last year on earth rock and roll  welcome to other side  i spent the better part of a year in airports hostels deserts couchsurfing sleeping on the beach and hanging out with the wanderlusting hippy crowd nahko trevor hall phish and major lazer became the soundtrack to my nonstop campaign to do all the things i had started doing lots of yoga and had made my way somehow to canada where fucking everything is legal one wondrous afternoon a group of the sweetest yoga instructors i ever met offered me weed nobody could believe that i had never smoked weed despite my long ass dreads and fairly chill demeanor they just kept saying we love you  you are very worthy of love i dont have any clue why they kept saying that but im crying as i think and write it now so like kids we went behind a tree in the woods and lit a joint it was interesting but i really dont think i actually got high buzzed maybe but not high i hung out with this group for a few days and continued to try feel whatever everyone else was feeling this empathy this love and figured wow i am so wound up i cant even get stoned fuck man i failed at even trying drugs i said to myself luckily i was not a quitter i hitchhiked to burning man 2015 and found my home my family and was completely at peace for the first time in my life still sober at this point my camp decided it was time for me to experience and set out to hook me up with a steady diet of cannabis laced food  weed now i had finally gotten stoned wonderfully opened up on the most beautiful canvas to be you at burning man i bloomed and enjoyed my own reflection the day of the burn i ran into some folks who offered me my first dab morning communion wow i felt well i felt period i was so connected with everyone  able to listen and i got it as i started telling my story a very sweet guy walks over to me and says its time we take the veil off brother are you open to this are you ready to see the real you as he pulls out the largest vial of liquid lsd i had ever seen since i dont want to write a book on reddit i will just say that this moment changed my life a group of at least 15 people gathered around me in a circle and hugged me and said i am love i will be love and that is all i ever was and i dropped apparently a fairly large dose on top of having an crazy amount of cannabis in my system someone near me as i began to trip for the first time said i was beautiful and was crying like a newborn rolling in the dust of the playa       and for 12 hours i saw i was i am     since then i have tried hbwr rivea and definitely gotten into the upper levels of stoned apparently i have a very strong tolerance for weed in the past month i have taken mdma twice following the maps protocol for ptsd assisted therapy yes i know i should wait 46 weeks between rolling but i had a situation shortly after my first session that required intervention and the second roll actually helped tremendously my caps score was 125 at its most severe with a lifetime baseline of 113 the scale only goes to like 135 i think i was destined to become one of the 22 a day who commit suicide following mdma treatment this month my score is about 20 as in cured fucking cured from ptsd drugs wow having come from the other side i know to treat them all with respect if you abuse any drug it will tell you no you have nothing to gain from me i have nothing to teach you i am an instrument go and do the work you have been told to do inside yourself and dont come back so i am mostly focused on using specific substances as a therapeutic tools and have integrated it into some of my spiritual  meditation practice but funny enough i have now realized i dont even need the drugs to get to the state of bliss  love as much if at all anymore they merely act as shortcuts and aides in this process today i now have a beautiful 9 week old son a stunning  supportive wife and and a life of real essence and truth i am grateful and music sounds and feels so much more vibrant i am alive  i continue to smoke weed every few days and barely touch alcohol anymore if at all im healthier  have a real sense of happiness in my life i feel that the drugs actually opened me up to well love loving myself not an image of myself but the reality of myself my darkness and my light ive learned to love both equally i would like to thank drugs for saving my life when used with respect and care these substances can save the lives of people so friends dont get too out of hand with self medicating  never planning on taking opiates benzos stims etc   plant medicine  psychedelics only as self exploratory tools   considering microdosing to see if that furthers my personal development  as i finish this off i am now sitting in my new home in vancouver bc skimming erowid  bl doing research on hippy flipping for a 3rd  hopefully final ptsd treatment session and looking for a therapist to walk with me over the next few weeks leading up to it as i prepare to attack my abandonment issues in full force powerful medicine use with caution i think i now know how to speak to my son about drugs now having been actively involved in the war on drugs and honestly i plan on teaching him from a scientific spiritual and logical viewpoint and allow him to make his own decision and if he trusts me enough i would be honored to be his guide so he knows hes safe and how to respect these tools anyway long ass post thank you 3 i love you guys 3  stay off meth there is nothing redeeming or beneficial about it k  edit for reference the ceo of my startup ousted me when he found out i was having a kid in january 2015 the event was a thinly veiled excuse covering up personal and internal power struggle issues but i am grateful for that experience because it put us in a highly challenging position and strengthened my personal resolve even further i am back in now but for what its worth but i lost access to all of that money i was wise early on thought and luckily did not get myself into debt with my own company but well it was a ludicrous amount of funds which would have been nice to have when you come to find out youre having a son unexpectedly i now realize that much of my self worth and identity had been wrapped up in this mirage of my job money cars and lifestyle i was not a real person i believe that psychedelics in particular helped ground me and alleviated hidden emotional and mental disorders that had plagued me for years however when you look successful and you arent a drug user by societys norms youre a blazing success its such bullshit though because on the inside you feel nothing and you are worse than dead and no i have not recovered financially but i am blessed to have very unique skills experience and an unstoppable work ethic hoping to get it all back again in a few years and cash out this time so keep us in your thoughts after the ousting i collected what money i had and we moved to vancouver to be close to my wifes family and take care of my wee peanut because i realized its really people that make life worth living so in the midst of this journey i lost all sense of stability and security as well i want to acknowledge and in a way thank the predrug version of myself because the discipline i had from years of not partaking is also what gave me the discipline to manage my usage and engage this endeavour with the respect and gravity it deserves always find balance edit 2 my speeling  general cognition sucks today because im fighting getting sick lol apologizes for any incoherent sentences

24.6383,13.89039,Addicted,"disclaimer this is not typical acid use there are many concretely beneficial effects from lower more infrequent doses

in 2014 i did on average 250ug of acid once a week for ten months from january to october or approximately 40 times doses typically ranged from 150ug600ug i assume i never knew for sure how much i actually took subjective experiences ranged from slightly glowing colors to complete loss of any sense contact with the physical world around me and a 10 minute orgasm at one point

i had the ability to i had savings i lived in a house of accepting camgirls real life wasnt getting in the way

the first thing people usually want to know is why nobody gets addicted to acid its unheard of when people trip they stay generally keep the fuck away from it for several months it can be a very overwhelming experience noncommunicable and utterly alien

i did it because i felt like i was learning every time i tripped i had the overwhelming sensation that the doors had opened and i was mainlining information from a direct source of truth every time i stopped tripping it felt like those doors closed and i forgot most of what id learned but i wanted to remember

so i kept doing it again and again higher and higher doses i needed to know i produced arturl i played music 

when we imagine frequent drug use we imagine it as a form of escapism  that real life is too difficult that we want to shut down for a time 

acid was exactly the opposite it heightened senses heightened what i was aware of in my own mind let me explore the way my own thoughts formed it took what i was and shoved my own face in it i couldnt look awayurl there were times of deliberately induced and absolutely excruciating emotional pain to which nothing in my regular life has ever come close i did it on purpose i needed to know

it is very difficult to talk about the things you learn while tripping because it occurs while in such a deeply altered state that language ceases to apply it really is more about a way of looking  a very specific type of engaging in experience thinking about the experience defeats the point because thinking about it is not the same thing as having it applying words to the experience is misleading by nature it is the concept in math where defining a thing gives it an outside and an inside and thus you can never define the thing that is always outside  in giving it a term in identifying it with boundaries it is no longer what you are trying to say the tao that can be named is not the tao it is the unspoken the mu

as time went on i stopped viewing myself as a being separate from the universe sensations became interesting to watch not motivating i entered such a permanent state of utter peace and contentment that i stopped wanting anything at all and by the end of it i barely got out of bed barely ate i had stopped working almost entirely and was living off slowly depleting savings why would i work why would i do anything i was not happy not sad i simply was i was free of desire i did not fear death 

and ten months in i realized thats what i was looking at  death i would compulsively whisper i am dead under my breath throughout the day i was an empty vessel and i realized that if i kept doing acid i probably would die out of sheer apathy

i wasnt terribly worried  but i had to make a decision did i want to continue down this path knowing the end was oblivion or did i want to close the doors and return to the world of the living

i chose the latter  not due to any compulsion or survival instinct at least not subjectively  but because i casually figured living would be more interesting 

the journey back was almost as strange and beautiful as the journey in as my motivations slowly began returning i found all i wanted was to forget whereas before i was trying to immerse myself in the knowing now i was constantly attempting to shut eyes that were permanently pried open no matter where i turned the knowledge had been seared into my brain it was like that feeling you get when you watch a movie and are suddenly aware that just out of the frame there are camera crews standing around the actors and you stop buying into the story because all you see is the movie set 

i just wanted to pretend this was all real i wanted to feel invested in myself i wanted to feel upset insecure proud happy anxiety anything i wanted to stop knowing here is a poem i wrote during that time periodurl lots of people have been making fun of this poem i am feeling insecure and want to take it down but instead am alleviating my worry about what you think of me with a disclaimer that it was personal and came from my journal so dont have high expectations

before i chose life i didnt mind the deep nothingness i had sunk into  but after the choice was made it became not uncomfortable but strange i felt like i had abandoned an old lover like this constant twinge of pain like a splinter in my throat i couldnt dislodge i thought constantly about tripping again and being reunited i did acid in my dreams 

over time almost without me realizing it the eye slowly eased shut like going to sleep i started to find myself caught up in moments of investment i started to feel insecure again annoyed and it was shitty and amazing

it took about another ten months for me to return to roughly where id been when i started 

im mostly normal now with only a few remnants sometimes certain types of conversations will trigger it where im sitting there and suddenly the eye of the universe has turned on me and i am melting away it is very intense i dont mind though thats a fundamental part of the feeling really  that i dont mind when its happening 

i feel like ive pulled the wool over my own eyes ive bought into this world it is profoundly comforting in a way so subconscious its difficult to identify its as though at all times behind my ears there is a powerful belief whispering its okay when i get locked out of my apartment when debt collectors call when my mom tells me she found a lump in her breast  its okay i chose this i am full i am held i am not afraid anymore and when i am its because fear is interesting because i have the privilege of feeling it

my underlying motivation now is to convey this awareness to others or feel as though i have it seems like the most important thing the only important thing and so here i am

 an elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path he wasnt sure of which direction to go and hed forgotten both where he was traveling toand who he was he remembered absolutely nothing he suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him she grinned toothlessly and with a cackle spoke now your third wish what will it be 

third wish the man was baffled how can it be a third wish if i haven’t had a first and second wish 

you’ve had two wishes already the hag said but your second wish was for you to forget everything you know she cackled at the poor man so it is that you have one wish left 

all right he said hesitantly i dont believe this but theres no harm in trying i wish to know who i truly am 

funny said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever that was your first wish

edit various rephrasings formatting and an embarrassing failure of month calculation



another edit 

a lot of comments are saying it made you feel like you understood but it was just tricking your brain

this is not implausible  a lot of people do acid and get utterly convinced of silly things but i want to make two points

one that information gained from the use of drugs is not automatically invalid if you have two brains one which was structured for a lot of reflection and one that wasnt and you fed the second brain a chemical that made it similar to the first brain would the reflection it undergoes be invalid

two that the feeling of knowledge is something we get every day anyway from school from authority figures from our own minds piecing things together what separates acid knowledge from regular knowledge is that acid knowledge tends to be about things you cant prove or easily communicate this puts it more in the same category as god  maybe its real maybe its not but we have no way of accessing it 

really its a few levels above god people frequently report psychedelics as one of the most meaningful events in their lives it has been shown instrumental in treating anxiety depression and endoflife fear there are measurable benefits from the outside its just very hard to talk about subjective sensations

for example  how would i describe a new color to you if youd never seen it i couldnt no matter how hard i tried to talk about it i might sound absolutely insane you might call me delusional but if you had seen it you would know exactly what i was talking about"
13.278208,7.7106266,Addicted,"im writing this so my love ones know what truly happened

today started like any saturday i wake up shake off my imposing existential dread make a pot of coffee and rip a couple of dabs with my housemates 

my friend we will call him michael his name is really michael
hands me the silicon rig 

yo jahbriel wanna rip this dab

before i could answer the rig is in my hands and im ripping said dab

i exhale instantly thinking to myself that i couldve held this dab a little longer than i did god im a thc fiend

in approximately 79 seconds i realize that im stoned out of my gourd naturally i dart to my kitchen and start cooking some beans and making filling for some tacos this is where i make the most fatal of flaws this was the first of wrong choices in what is presumptively the last day of my life 

so i chop away at some veggies im thinking some white onion hell yeah cherry tomatoes please get in my mouth minced garlic you already know black beans please fuck my wife and finally the x factor in this filling and the new bane of my existence habanero

fast forward to me eating this taco and im just loving it god it was such a good taco i finish wash my plate and head downstairs and hop on my laptop while browsing the interwebs it doesnt take very much time to stumble onto this sub im catching up on my daily dose of you all and find some story about a guy who fucked someones mom on prozac and some brew note to self is this the secret way of seducing milfs that ive been missing all along

anyway everyone in the comments was saying wow im jealous i too was very jealous i wanna fuck a milf

a light goes off in my head 

nsfw 

so i head over to pornhub i needed some me time

i click on categories naturally i swiftly click milfs

i procede to j o 

after several minutes of making some sweet love to myself i begin to notice that something was different and not in a pleasant way i tried to brush it off but over time the feeling began to intensify it was coming from my dick oh no

suddenly i was transported to a different place i was back in my kitchen watching myself cook those beans from earlier i again could smell the liquid smoke i tossed in and hear the sizzling of the oil my past self was deveining and deseeding the habanero i rewatched my technique after handling the habaneros i realized the dire mistake that i had made past jahbriel never washed his damn hands 

instantly i am sucked back into my own body some light tears are rolling down my face and im still beating my meat in my bed only now i know the severity of my situation and how i was brought here 

i stop and close my laptop and just lay down with my eyes closed

my dick is fucking on fire right now every passing second is a never ending pain crescendo i feel as though my dick is literally burning at the fucking stake and no matter what i do i cannot stop it i took a shower i rubbed it with lotion i even dunked it in a glass of fucking milk thats how desperate i am im thinking about really chopping my dick off this is becoming less of a hyperbole as time goes on this is one of the most painful sensations i have ever felt

mom and dad i deserved this pain natural selection has waved its hands and done its course and clearly i am not fit for survival

10.966051,0.5068579,Recovered,"i remember coming home from school one night  and when i walked in the house  about 10 syringes and a bag of meth were on the kitchen table with a note from my mom saying “found this in your pants pocket in the bathroom “i remember walking to my room and when i passed hers i heard her crying  

i remember waking up to 50 missed called from my mom  and see her pull in the driveway and run as fast as she could through our yard  into the house  only to see me alive and not dead from an overdose and let out a sigh of relief 

i remember every time i would use the bathroom if i wasn’t out in 5 minutes she would come knock on the door and ask if i was okayjust to make sure i hadn’t overdosed yet

i remember nights i would be dope sick  and in pain when i would wake up the next morning she would leave a 20 dollar bill on the table  because she didn’t like to see me in pain 

i remember sometimes when i would give her a hug  when she would turn away  i would see her eyes water up because she hated to see me looking so rough 

i remember sometimes if i hadn’t been home in days she would message me and ask if i had ate anything that day  and would send me money for food it was always 18 dollars  it was always 18 because she knew if she sent 20 i would withdraw it and spend it on dope 

i remember the first time she found out i was injecting heroin  and she held me and cried  saying “my baby is using needles” 

i remember seeing her come home from work  with dark circles under her eyes from not sleeping the night before  worrying if i was okay all night 

i remember many times when i would come home  i would see the living room light turn off and her room light turn on when i was pulling in the driveway because she didn’t want to see how skinny i had gotten  

i remember sometimes we would talk on the phone and after she hung up she would call right back because she forgot to say “i love you” just in case it was the last time she ever got to say it  

i remember my brother told me every time the phone rang she would almost be in a panic running to get it   because she was wondering if that was the call saying i overdosed again 

i love my mama so much  and i’m so glad i get to call her tomorow and tell her i’m 5 months clean off heroin and meth  i’m so glad i don’t keep her up at nights  wondering if i’m okay  i’m so grateful i have a mama who cares and loves me so much

i smoked about half a gram in a small joint because he said it would be strong and boy was he right he said it was a cookie flavour but it didn’t taste like that to me i coughed so hard my glasses came off my wife heard me coughing in the basement and ran down worried which totally blew my cover she rumbled me and told me off for smoking 

i’m just eating some turkey sandwiches now "
12.854974,4.70085,NA,"so im chillin in my room right its like 10 at night and im on my shitty laptop playing runescape trying to just figure out what the fuck im even doing with my life

i was talkin to this girl on tinder and things were going pretty fast as a preface to this i had just moved to this city because my dumbass was trying to go back to school after being unwillingly cucked by my gf she fucked my friends i lost my mind dumped her ass and moved so i didnt know anyone except my roommate which never showered  he smelled like cheetoes

well i match with some hunnies on tinder and none of them were really going anywhere except for this one girl well call her bri so bri and i talked for maybe 45 minutes she was this 20 yr old who was doing some internship for an amusement park right off the bat she was wanting to hang out this to me was pretty sketch because every girl on tinder ever is usually very skeptical about meeting up you could match with 1000 girls but maybe only 4 would actually be down to meet up and most of the time it was in public

i sent her a dick pic  my address  just like that her ass was in her car driving over to come see me bird up

about 20 minutes go by and she texts me asking me if i wanna go sledding im like bitch its fucking 11 at night and its the middle of summer what are you talking about shes like lol ok nevermind im ing in my mind because now im thinkin this bitch might be crazy whatever though as long as im getting some version of laid well be aight

bri shows up but with a friendim like nigga you didnt mention anything about some ugly ass friend whatever though i go outside to meet them now her car matched the description but when both of these hoes got out the car i verbally said oh sorry i thought my friend was here i guess yall drive the same car my bad

they both started laughing and she was likeutrustmeimdonaldtrump its me bri im looking at her and im likeno you arent shes like yes i am she reaches into her purse and pulls out her shitty iphone4s with our tinder conversation im like ohi guess its dark out here my bad at this point its fucking awkward as shit were standing out in the parking lot not saying anything she brought a friend when she never mentioned it in the first place i didnt even tell my roommate what was going on  this girl looked like a completely different person im not a noob at tinder  i know the runaround when it comes to checking to see if someone is legit or not so i was very surprised

im like whatever dood come on lets go back to my crib we start walking back and shes like are you okay you look super uncomfortable im like nah nah im just shy around new people or whatever just trying to bullshit something so i could at least get these two lying sacks of shit back to my room to see what the deal is

we get back to my room and i realize that she is the same girl she just gained like a hunnid pounds and dyed her hair

y i k e s

i offer the hoes some beer and i really start contemplating what the fuck im even doing with my life i was praying that whoever built the apartments foundation did a good job because we are seriously putting it to the test tonight

we get into my room and not even 5 minutes in both of these girls are asking to see that fat dick in person



first off  my dick is whatever but its definitely not going to be shit in comparison to your pear shaped bodies i mean if youre a normal sized human being itll do the job tbh my dick doesnt really get hard to sociopathic liars who couldnt even post a pic from this fucking century so i knew that wasnt happening

also do you realize how fucking crazy you have to be to walk into someones home at 11 at night on a wednesday with an unmentioned uninvited friend asking to see some dudes dick youve only known for 5 minutes ok yeah you can judge me i sent a pic of my dick but whatever dude its snapchat theres no face  and even if they screenshotted it i can deny till the cows come home literally that its mine

at this point im visibly uncomfortable im thinking these girls are going to rob me at dick point or something because of how odd this situation is

so after awkwardly trying to change the subject bri basically spills the beans and says that they wanna do coke off my dick remember when i asked you if you wanted to go sledding

oh shit damni mean these girls arent hot by any means but they wanna do coke of my dick you realize how much street cred this could possibly give me im kinda cool but damn im not that cool you know was i ever going to have this opportunity again

shit ok if yall want

they were all excited and shit i was fucking terrified but i had to get my street cred i could win every game of never have i ever with this shit

i pull down my pants and her friend just grabs it and starts jerking me off she was fucking eager bri is just sitting in the corner watching while she was grabbing the bag of coke out of her purse

im having trouble getting hard at first but then bri comes over and puts it in her mouth well as long as i dont make eye contact and pretend its someone else this should work just fine they start passing my dick back and forth to each other and i cant decide if this is the most awesome or worst thing thats ever happened to me

i then lay back in the bed her friend dries my dick off  and they start putting this line on my dick i dont know how much coke they had with them but id guess it was an 8ball because id never seen a sack that fat before

they took turns making the line snorting it and licking up the parts they couldnt get and repeating not gonna lie it was kinda tight and i swear i was getting a little coked out too but maybe it was like contact high not sure

so youre probably wonderinghow did that end

well bri went into the bathroom for like 15 minutes while i got my dick sucked by her friend i came and they left bri felt bad because i didnt get any coke since they did it all so she left me like 8 xanax pills im like uh yeah thats a way better deal imo she puts the pills on my desk and i walk them back out to their car

hugs me we should do this again sometime

uh yeah sure

a couple weeks later bri called me in the middle of the night saying she was coming over i was like uhh yeah please dont i have school tomorrow i fall back asleep 6 in the morning i get a knock on the door and its bri completely fucked up out of her mind screaming at me for not answering my phone i slam the door on her and go back to sleep my roommate was fucking pissed

i never saw bri or her ugly friend again

i ended up failing out and moving back home

we still snapchat sometimes  she even lost weight

so yeah basically beware with tinder and maybe meet at a starbucks or something before giving out your private address

edit so scumbagwe gotcha hehe

in all seriousness thank you to everyone whos sent me positive messages for those telling me to kill myself cmonbruh it really means a lot in these tough times im trying to eventually release the stories i post on rdrugs onto a physical print ill have more info on that as time goes on thanks everyone again 3  "

14.874016,2.836589,Addicted,"last weekend i really overdid it with drugs and everything i had off of work from thursday to sunday so obviously its time to get fucked up thursday morning i dropped two tabs of acid and started smoking weed all day that was fun as shit but the acid lasted insanely long like until noon on friday this is where i make a very very bad decision i wanted to party all weekend so instead of sleeping like a normal person i bought a fuckload of stimulants specifically 50 mg of meth 80 mg of adderall and 200mg of molly i took the meth friday at around 3

right after i took the meth i realized i had made a mistake so to balance out the meth i chose to go to a party and drink a fucking lot so i drank all night friday night saturday rolls around and i am fucking gone just about ready to drop when i realize i have my cousins catholic school grad party fuck i decide to make a quick prayer to my lord and savior addy christ then mouth breathe my way through this grad party i wound up in a conversation with a nun to give you guys an image of how i look i was wearing the same clothes from thursday morning unshowered unshaven the only hygiene thing i had done was brushing my teeth which i did out back by the dumpsters behind a cvs with a bottle of water and toothpaste that i had purchased inside because no matter how fucked up i am if i brush my teeth im succeeding at life 

anyways im chatting with this nun when my friend texts me that were going to a concert tonight ok the grad party ends at six and my friend picks me up and takes me to the venue which i dont get a very good look at but appears to be an abandoned warehouse im waking around in a haze and drinks keep appearing in my hand and my reflexes are great so i keep drinking them i quickly lose my friend then realize im gonna pass out so to save myself i take al 200mg of molly the molly carries me through the concert but afterwards im still in a haze and still cant find my friend i run outside see a van with the sliding door open and decide that i should get into it before i pass out so i run and dive into this van getting a huge gash on my forehead in the process this finally knocks me out

i come to sunday night at 1030 in an apartment that i do not recognized with a splitting headache i manage to stand up very dizzy and stumble out into an unfamiliar kitchen the owner of said kitchen sees me stumble catches me and sits me down on his couch then gets me a fuckload of gatorade i touch my forehead and feel stitches confused i ask my new friend where i got stitches and he says he lives with a nursing student at a nearby university i dont live in a college town i ask this dude where i am and he says madison wisconsin i live 3 hours away from madison when i tell him this he says im welcome to crash at his place tonight and as much as i hate to mooch of this guy i pretty much have to i thank him then go back to sleep

monday morning i wake up at 830 my new buddy scott hands me my freshly washed clothes my phone and my wallet i call in sick to work then i called my friend who left me at the concert and he comes to pick me up i noted down scotts address and immediately upon arriving home i mailed him a thank you note and a check for 200 because he basically saved my life then i go to the hospital to discover that i have a concussion which is great because i love testing my health insurance

tldr fuck you go read it i worked hard on that shit"
9.693279,-27.014866,Addicted,"im an avid chess player when sober but playing on different substances is one of my favorite things to do i dont know if anyone on rdrugs plays chess or even cares about this but here im posting my experience playing while drunk tripping tweaking or high



sober baseline

i play 10  0 classical on lichessorg normal stuff i usually try to close the position and break the opponent through positional play

sober game url im white

alchohol tipsy

moves feel more natural i can move without thinking too much but i still play accurately i blast trance on the headphones and play 3  0 blitz winning most games in some respects i feel that i play better when buzzed drunk game url im black

alchohol smashed

i do not give a single fuck when i move i am wayyy too aggressive i just do a tidal wave of pawns and exchange material whenever theres a chance i pretty much lose 90 of my games when im super drunk

adderall

hole eee shit i turn in to a motherfucking chess computer on adderall i can deeply analyze positions without sacrificing too much time 10  0 on adderall and i win almost every game playing at an 1800 level on chesscom this is seriously a performance enhancing drug for chess

lsd 150 μg

did i change my board theme to rainbow hexagons why does my music sound like its coming out of my head not my headphones oh im playing chess yes what a lovely game a battle between two minds theres truly nothing like it 

i notice that i am very good at spotting tactics playing on lsd this is when you temporarily sacrifice material for a lethal attack or a long term advantage in the game looking back on my games from lsd trips im amazed at how innovatively i play i make moves that sober me wouldnt never even consider overall acid makes me a much more creative player i play with aggression and vigor creating threats with every move lsd  chess  amazing

salvia

no

shrooms golden teachers 3g

a human there is a human i am playing against across the internet it feels that our minds are linked over such a vast expanse of space and time oh right i need to move

im sorry but i play like a retard on shrooms maybe its the way psylocibin effects the brain but i blunder every 5 moves an interesting thing i noticed however is that im much more compassionate when playing on mushrooms i congratulate my opponent on their win and am impressed by their cleverness but overall lsd is the superior psychedelic for chess

edit uroryspencer gave an amazing account of his experience with chess on shrooms in a reply to this thread ive included an excerpt but you can see the whole post by clicking hereurl

 staring down at the tan and black coloured board i observed a desert the dwindling number of pieces looked as dramatic as a standoff between great mountains with cactuses and lizards squatting on boulders the games that followed were suitably hallucinatory i felt i was witnessing every possible permutation of warfare and conflict all on that board clashing lines of muddy footsoldiers brawling in the dirt tense mexican standoffs mages teasing one another from afar all in glorious technicolour imax 3d 

marijuana

on weed i play as i do when im sober but i calculate positions much more slowly i notice that i play a lot more conservatively making sure that my defense is solid before making any attacking maneuvers overall i play quite well when high

dxm

im trying this tonight its my first time tripping on dxm and ill be doing 300mg leave a comment to predict how you think i will play ill be sure to post links to my games tomorrow

hi rdrugs i am on drug right now i am on dxm my legs feel switched and i cant walk and everything fucked but holy fuck can i play chess i think this game is buried inside my bones i can play because i am chess

17.682714,11.232305,NA,"so a few years back it was that blissful time right when the last semester of college was finally over and it was time for summer for us summer meant getting fucked up and making memories preferably at the same time 


my four friends liz patrick jamie sophie and i decided we should definitely all go camping one night we live in california and agreed that there is no better way to kick off the start of summer time than to drive up to lake tahoe to go camping and trip balls all of us are at least a little into drugs so you have five college stoners some of us being psychedelic enthusiasts as well all of us had tried acid before except sophie who had before had only partaken in the sticky icky green but was really interested in lsd

it was early june and it was fucking beautiful out the drive there was amazing it was a clear and sunny day with a slight breeze once we finally arrived at our camp site we spent a good half hour not even talking to each other and just admiring the view it was around 3 pm when we had set everything up we had our tents blankets pillows snacks and other random shit we wanted to bring with us and of course some real good lsd that jamie and i had saved over from a few months before 

after sitting around talking about past acid experiences while smoking a few joints we all agreed we were ready to drop sophie was a bit apprehensive at first but then curiosity got the best of her and she was in i dont remember exactly how much everyone took but i know i had 300 mics and everyone else had at least 180  

were all having an amazing time theres just this big great synergy between all of us we were euphoric running around through the woods exploring yelling and laughing until our sides hurt it was like being a little kid again everything is warping and wavy the clouds are swirling and morphing and the trees are swaying back and forth in a beautiful psychedelic dance it had started getting dark and we wandered off pretty far from our camp site so we started heading back liz and i lit a fire and gathered a bunch of blankets near it so we could all sit around and just chill out

then patrick says something pretty unexpected hey this may sound odd but my friend was telling me about having an orgy on lsd and liz cuts him off yes im in these two are now grinning from ear to ear their faces shifting around and looking just like oil painting they stare at jamie sophie and i apprehensively waiting for our response why not jamie pipes in im fucking hoping to god that sophie agrees because i had such a big crush on this girl she laughs and kind of shrugs and agrees to join im just staring at a flower growing in the ground thinking ohmyfuckingsweetjesusisthisreallyhappening 

upsychedelicorgy youre the deciding vote are you down liz asks i grin and say fuck it sure my friends cheer i can feel the lsd fueled excitement coursing through my veins and in the atmosphere but it was probably just my boner we carelessly throw a bunch of blankets and pillows over the ground and honestly i cant remember what happened after that one minute we were sitting around the fire talking then the next minute were all naked and on top of each other

you guys you have no idea how fucking amazing this was think about the best sex you ever had and now multiply that by 100 there were fractals all around me there were little outlines of fractals and crazy geometric patterns painted over my friends skin the euphoria was so intense a few times we had to just stop and lie back for a few moments to catch our breath and calm down because we were laughing so hard it felt like i was being tickled all over but i never wanted it to end it was like all our energy and emotions came together as one and i could just feel everyones energy and it was just so magical everything was magnified and my heart was beating so fast i thought it was going to bounce out of my chest jamie later told me he started getting into weird thought loops the middle of it so then without thinking he just yelled this is not the time for an existential crisis this is the time to fuck

 i came so fucking much i have never cum that much as i had that night it is just so indescribable everyone was morphing and their faces were almost swirling the colors were just like a van gogh painting the english language is so limited for me to put this experience into words it was like a never ending climax of just absolute ecstasy at one point the jizz on sophie back started changing into quickly shifting rainbow colors and i couldnt stop fucking laughing because it was so funny i remember in my head i was like haha its like radioactive jizz which only made me laugh way harder and like a maniac patrick asked me what the fuck was up and i just said this dick and then everyone started laughing uncontrollably again 

it was beautiful just absolutely beautiful my friends and i still refer to it as that night and when we trip together we always laugh about that experience that night also made me realize i was in love with sophie and believe it or not were now engaged 

happy bicycle day"
16.33098,9.85613,Recovered,"when i was younger i enjoyed occasionally tripping on lsd i loved the state of mind it put me in i loved the introspective thoughts the deep realizations about life the mindblowing amount of detail that could be heard in music and the effect sound has on the mind the insane visuals etc you guys know what im talking about

for several years i never had a bad trip i had some rough moments here and there but nothing i couldnt snap out of before the end of a trip i was even in several scenarios that could have been trip ruining but always managed to get through those just fine somehow

then i had a really bad trip thats stuck with me ever since i am someone who suffers from anxiety and i felt the worst fear imaginable during this trip i saw things in people i had never seen before and it freaked me the hell out i became hyper aware of peoples nervous mannerisms and the behaviors people use to push that feeling away moments of social awkwardness lasted what felt like an eternity eye contact became physically painful theres really so much more i can say but i think you get the point by now 

its been 4 years and i still get flashbacks as they are commonly described i dont literally have a flashback but i will see something that reminds me of the extreme anxiety i felt while tripping and my mind will recall and reenter that state it is something i deal with every day of my life and it makes my life feel like its not worth living there is no point to life if you are in a constant state of fear life is meant to be enjoyed with others but all i want is to be alone i tried getting every type of help imaginable and nothing has ever worked i believe i have done permanent damage to my consciousness unless there is a way for me to forget what happened that day it will always be in my mind as much as i love all the incredible moments i had on lsd id take them all back if it meant i could feel the way i used to feelthese part seemed ambiguous

your parents aren’t there to ruin your fun they may be ignorant on drugs thinking things like lsd will fry your brain or weed will lead to heroin use but they only care because they love you if you take a look around you the kids who can use any drugs they want without their parents caring will have a rough life smoking weed all day may seem like the best thing ever now but developing that habit during high school isn’t what you want your parents may be ignorant or overestimate the danger of drugs but have some empathy

you can sit your parents down and explain to them til you’re blue in the face that lsd isn’t dangerous but good luck getting them to think their child should use it you are their literal child to your parents it seems like just the other day you were their little baby if you are 1417 you have a whole life to use drugs some drugs are amazing safe when used correctly and even positive for mental health problems that being said there’s a time and place for everything

you’re going to experiment with your friends and that’s cool when i was 16 my dad told me not to smoke again got caught until i was out of high school i remember being so mad thinking i was an adult but really he was just looking out for me i know you guys will use drugs anyway so please research and practice harm reduction but when it comes to your ignorant parents just let it be they are scared and love you either lie and hide like a sociopath or hold off until you’re an adult with a more developed brain

i know what all ya nasties are thinkin 

i just took some high power blotter acid and started tripping billies wiggin out shittin rainbows twilight zoning ya know jumping off a picnic table or something and imagining jumping from an airplane and skydove kinda like michael de santa in gta5 

nah ladies and gentlemen i live in a reasonably rural place with a local airport where a tandem skydive costs about 200 buckaroos and acid costs 10 a tab

recently my best friend came home from school he studied abroad and we just watched fear and loathing in las vegas while smoking a joint and i suggested this we were in such a fuck it impulsive decision mood and the vibes were resonating

 so we bought tickets day of early morning took our tab an hour prior and we were so excited and also paranoid but we already paid 200 each so we had to do it if we didnt pay i bet we wouldnt of 

we meet the sky diver and the pilot while we were sporting raybans sunglasses on a cloudy day and did a small verbal lesson as to whats going down i jokingly said us right fellas and i gotta say we kept our composure completely using scipted small talk 

getting in the plane felt like a dream my heart was racing like crazy like going up a huge roller coaster you know youre safe but cant help the adrenaline to pump me and my friend constantly smiling and laughing like we some how beat the system i had a vision that i was in a bomber plane going over no mans land the roar of the engine the adrenaline

when we jumped well i didnt jump i made the instructor jump us out and probably just thought i was getting some last minute jitters but in reality i was tripping balls and imagined i was in bioshock infinite as booker dewitt falling from columbia to the inevitable flat farm lands below 

1010 one of the best memories of my youth ill always treasure 

ps when i hit the ground i cartoonishly started kissing the grass like a movie character going onto ground after years at sea 

edit jeezy petes this thing blew up whilst at work thanks for the appreciation everybody and that you enjoyed the read

the fall was obviously exhilarating the whistle of the wind in my ears and yelling like a little kid it was so pure honestly the one thought i had for a while was huh im in a little baby holder attached to man hurdleing towards the earth at 122mph that has done this hundreds of times laughing at me for my reaction obviously a havin fun yet was screamed in my ear and i dorkishly yelled oooooh yeeeee my throat was really dry from fear alright

trips are always fun but sometimes like a dream you remember it was good magnificent really but only small remneces and details at least for me you should always try to do something significant emotionally or sitautionally buy the ticket take the ride 

pps  we got a taxi there and back may i add 

i may be stupid but im not stupid"
18.938269,12.852993,Addicted,"hi rdrugs 
i originally postedurl this on rmdma but a friend suggested me to share it here that you guys might like it too

please share your thoughts i will probably recreate this next year and would like to improve it if you have any advice  

recently i had one of my most amazing rolls yet and i really want to share it

a little background ive been rolling for 4  5 years now mdma has been an amazing tool for me to grow internally and externally ive introduced a lot of my friends to this marvelous substance but a lot of them havent tried since theyre not comfortable taking drugs thats good and i never insist

anyway for my past birthday i organized a party i rented a house in the woods and announced to all the friends i invited that the party was mdma themed that if they were to go they had to take mdma if they didnt want to then wed celebrate any other time i invited most of my close friends expecting that most of them would say no since most of them dont do drugs surprisingly all of them said yes 

the house is 2 hours away from our city i asked all of them to bring a big blanket a big pillow a lot of fruit and a funny outfit we traveled in 5 cars everyone brought nice things when we arrived to the houseurl we all were speechless its an amazing house only surrounded by nature incredibly big and comfy we arrived early around 1pm    immediately after everyone was settled in i started creating our environment after all my trips ive learned a couple of things that make rolling more comfortable and nice so without telling anyone i just started crafting it 

so i moved all the furniture from the living room i took everyones blankets and pillows and created a huge floor bed literally i stacked 25 blankets in the center to create a huge i think it was around 5x3 meters comfy space i changed all the lamps in the area to black lights the ones that make colors shine in the dark then arranged christmas lights all around the bed i also brought neon body paint brushes and 300 glowsticks i brought a home theater from home and arranged all the speakers around the big bed a nice thing about the place is that we had absolutely no cellphone signal so no one used their cellphones at all i had a special playlist for the party pm if you want it  its really cool 

after the space which we called plurcama was ready we ate and went to a swimming pool which was in the garden of the house when we were all there i made the announcement that i had a surprise we were not only about to take mdma also lsd of course i told all of them that if they didnt want acid they wouldnt have to take it but again only 2 people refused everyone took it 

i gave half tab to everyone and the party started i continued arranging things prepared a fireplace outside actually this was a friends idea whom in his trip was fascinated with fire made a camping tent outside in case anyone would like to watch the stars also brought pois and a hula hoop 

a lot of my friends were newbies to lsd too so i was almost all the time checking out if they were having a good time it was a really nice lsd trip no one had taken the mdma yet half of them were around the tent watching the sunset the other half were around the fire it was really nice everyone laughing talking some of us dancing we took the lsd around 530 pm at 830 i called each one of them to the fireplace it was kind of a hard task since everyone was really into whatever they were doing but after 20 minutes everyone was already around the fire

i gave everyone their mdma i had it in parachute pills in home i have a weighing machine so everyone had an accurate dose i made 25 doses of 110 mg when everyone had it on their hands a friend of mine started shouting give a speech give a speech and everyone followed so i started talking it was amazing they were all paying really close attention it was not easy since i was already tripping hard on lsd but still i think i did a good work i told them something like this

i love all of you this party this experience all of this is just a way of expressing my love its not easy to get together 25 people you love just to be with them believe me but the fact that all of you came despite your fears or prejudices is really valuable for me this substance is really special dont think i just like to get people drugged this is a experience about connections about learning about sharing please enjoy it take the best of it i love you

of course its not literally the words i say but its kind of how i recall it everyone took their parachute and swallowed it then we all stood there and waited until the fire finished when everyone got into the house their reaction was just indescribable everything shined with black light there were colors everywhere and the music was really absorbent we all sat around the big bed and waited until the mdma started working

a lot of friends didnt know what to expect one of them came to me and told me he felt exactly equal as before i just told them to give it time

then it happened pffffffffffffff i dont know how to describe it one of my friends a really shy girl she was lying on the bed just hugging pillows i came close to her and she told me why is life so beautiful why  is the music so perfect why didnt i know i could love myself this much and hugged me i stood up and started dancing the candyflipping feeling was really overwhelming when thisurl song came up i exploded i started dancing closed my eyes and just enjoyed the feeling of being overwhelmed with peace when it finished and i checked my surrounding i swear i thought that is definitely how heaven looks like basically all people who have been important to me were there loving each other being happy being at peace everyone was either hugging dancing smiling laughing ughhhhhhhhhhhh writting this is giving me goosebumps ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
thisurl one was really nice to roll with too

i think i could write a book if i started describing all the experiences that happened to me that night all the things my friends shared with me the context of why those things are extremely important it was heaven really

as i was walking through the room every 2 steps someone either called my name or came close to me asking me for hugs or telling me the importance i had in their life thanking me for the experience asking me to dance in a point everyone gave me a hooray and claimed my name i dont want to sound selfish i just want to share that i think i have never felt that much love towards me in my life that feeling was just god

a lot of people didnt know each other but everyone was connecting in really awesome ways shy people with geek people with cool people there were no prejudice no stereotypes 

of all the awesome experiences that happened to me that night ill share one of the most intense for me 

one of the assistants is c 
c has been one of my bests friends for around 8 years hes been a milestone in my life without a doubt i could tell you i wouldnt be the person i am today without meeting him a little more  context im bisexual mostly gay i think you could say a 5 in kinseys scale he is straight you can guess the rest of the background i had a strong crush on him he was cool with it but nothing ever happened he is really straight 

c and i were together and talking and he started telling me the strong impact ive had in his life then he started asking me why are you always single i dont understand everyone in this party tells me youre full of magic but youre almost never with someone i explained to him that what i expect of a relationship is progress that most of people start to date you because youre cool or because youre good looking but for me my priority is to feel that that person makes me grow makes me a better version of myself and thats not easy to find 

we kept talking about what we expect in a relationship and he told me i want to make an experiment come with me we went out to the tent it was pffff the stars were just as i told you there were no towns like in 100 km around that house without light pollutions the stars were just ugh when we were there he was really hesitant i told him he didnt have to do anything he didnt want to he said but i want to and kissed me 

i just cant describe it if youve ever been candyflipping and kissed someone you love maybe you can know how it felt but this was like the peak of 8 years of relationship a breaking point it was like feeling the universe in a kiss when we stopped kissing he looked up and said i now know there is a god look at the stars pffff as i write this i can feel my body overflowing with serotonin 

we kissed again and he told me he wanted to keep experimenting we were all night holding hands hugging and telling each other how important we were just as a prologue the experiment is over c haha he realized he really is straight and kind of broke my heart a little bit but i understand it

a friend of mine cried because she said she couldnt believe it was possible to be that happy the shy friend i wrote about in the beginning told me that she just learned how amazingly she loves herself and her life a friend who is moving abroad forever told me he realized how to conquest the universe through having children and sharing all your knowledge with them everything was perfect

another really nice detail is that the house had this arch type structure with a quote en un día claro se ve hasta siempre which translate in something like in a clean day you can see until eternity everything was mindblowing everyone had a blast 

the newbies all of them were amazed most of them are still in their honeymoon with mdma asking me when the next party is going to be of course i told them that next year 

the next day we all woke up cuddling with each other had a breakfast and no one had negative effects after it they were playing cards and sharing their experience up until today everyone is still haring how much they grew from the experience how many internal walls they teared down how many prejudices they broke how much they learned to feel and love life

i just i expected something nice from giving mdma to 25 people in an isolated house in the woods but id never expected it to be such a groundbreaking party everything absolutely everything was perfect the bonds between all of us is stronger than ever people who had never met before are now extremely close friends when chatting in the whatsapp group we have together we all came to the conclusion that what that party made to us is freed us we all are free from so many things now ive had at least 30 mdma experiences but this is probably one the best 

so yeah i just wanted to share it document it somehow
you guys reddit community are really awesome ive learned a lot from you thanks for reading

 
as you can read english is not my native language so sorry for any mistake 

i love you all 


edit 2808 wow guys thanks for all the nice messages and pms reading other peoples experiences is always uplifting and its what encouraged me to share mine a lot of people has told me in this couple of hours you would like to be in an experience like this  as i see it these kind of experiences are possible and amazing when they happen but they need someone with the will motivation and knowledge to organize it if you feel you would like to share something like this with your friends its up to you if you have the possibility to have a positive impact in peoples life you really should  

if you want tips or help ill be glad to share more details of how this was organized hugs to all of you 

edit 2 yes im encouraging the experience sharing not necessarily the drug consuming but if you plan something with drugs involved it is reallyimportant  firstly to inform yourself and share all the risks and the ways to do it correctly you can find a lot of info about how to do things correctly here url and url

edit 3 you can also find really useful info hereurl and hereurl

erowid has been providing unbiased information about drugs for over 20 years strongly resisting any attempts at censorship and taking strict measures to ensure utmost privacy for those wanting to learn

weve seen many changes in policies and attitudes about drugs over the last 20 years with the regulation of cannabis increases in research on psychedelics and revelations about the use of ketamine for the treatment of depression

recreational markets have undergone huge changes too with the hugely increased popularity of research chemicals followed by operation webtryp and then a decade later the huge amounts of methylone that made it into the mainstream markets as mdma it would have been hard to imagine the existence of darknet markets 20 years ago let alone the shape that they now take

erowid also runs ecstasydataorgurl the only publicly searchable database of drug analysis results with results going back to 1996 the ecstasy market has changed a lot in that time from everything being a round crudely pressed pill like thisurl to today where ecstasy tablets may be comparable to professional pharmaceutical manufacturing quality even if the ingredients may not be like thisurl we have seen all kinds of things come through the lab with the popularity of dxm in the early 2000s the huge numbers of pills with piperazines in 20082010 and then the current situation where pills may contain dangerously high doses of nothing but mdma


drug education isnt all that sexy and we dont get any government funding but currently we have the most incredible funding opportunity that weve ever had in our 22 year history an anonymous donor has set up a fund to doubleurl any donations received by 10th march up to a total of 250000

we have been incredibly lucky to see so many supporters show themselves and are currently at 173k250k now at 183 of 250 of the target we have some incredible plans for securing the future of erowid and would hugely love the support of rdrugs

month 6  water heat and electricity shut off oh well i had a woodstove and snow  water so fuck it  meth paranoia meth psychosis meth meth meth prob 2gday

sheriff gives me the boot and three days to remove all my belongings i have no family not because meth but because they died when i was 17 and my friends are just as methed out as i was so i had nowhere to bring my stuff and no money or way to put it in storage so i lose everything that wouldnt fit in a suitcase

13.635463,-3.0976443,Recovering,"ive been addicted to heroin for 8 years i was 15 the first time i used heroin two months later weeks after my 16th birthday i shot up for the first time im an adult now and all my friends are pieces of shit everyone who i wish i was friends with are graduating school with fantastic degrees or did that years ago already and have good jobs with rewarding love in their lives meanwhile i sell hash and work at a gas station and every girlfriend ive had just wanted free shots basically i was supposed to be so much more and i can be so much more i havent heard from my parents in 4 years because they care a lot more about their upcoming rugby player son rather than their heroin addict son  i cant really blame them

that being said at exactly 115900 pm march 5th 2018 i took my last shot at the time i write this it is 159 am march 6th 2018 all i have is cable television a half pack of cigarettes and a quarter ounce of primo quality hashish the longest time ive been off heroin after getting addicted to it has been about 2 days i remember how it felt and im prepared for it no matter how bad i felt during those 2 days it cant possibly be as bad as i feel all the fucking time

16.530518,5.7245507,NA," id like to preface this with that i did not purposely feed my dog acid this was an accident and it freaked me out

i usually keep my tabs hidden but this morning my buddy asked if he could come by my place and buy a tab off of me so i cut one off my sheet and set it on my counter and moved on with my day

about 45 minutes ago i was playing dark souls 3 and i let my dog come into my room so when she came in i wasnt really paying attention to what she was doing after a little i saw her licking my counter and i paused my game to go scold her bc i assume she found some food when i remembered what i had out i tried to open her mouth and pull the tab out before she swallowed it but it was too late

so i freaked the fuck out for a little bit but after a couple google searches and reading some reddit stories i settled down and just wanna make sure she has a good trip i havent dropped in a while but i decided to take a tab with her so she doesnt have to trip alone

probably gonna go for a walk in a second shes getting really anxious and pacing around the room a lot bringing treats and a backpack full of dog toys and shit do you guys think dogs like pink floyd any reccomendations to give her a good trip 

whelp wish me luck

update 1 walking to the park and shes off leash she seems like shes having a great time sniffing the fuck out of everything and has a big ass smile on her face 

update 2 shes running around a lot shes got a lot of energy and will sometimes just chase invisible shit or start jumping on random spots in the grass my tab is starting to kick in so i will update later whenever i decide to get back on reddit thanks for all the support and help

update 3 great night tbh she had a blast chased her tail a whole lot nomed on my arm for a while rolled in the grass she even swam in the lake she didnt really care for her treats and wasnt all that interested in her toys overall we both had an amazing time and shes asleep now at one point while time was playimg from dark side of the moon i swear we were on the same level bc she was chilled the fuck out just staring at the lake with me thanks for all the love you guys are awesome dont let this happen to you and hide your drugs will update tomorrow with how shes acting and doing

final update sorry i fell asleep late last night and just woke up puppers seems to be doing just fine she was super excited to see me when i woke up as she always is she seems a little bit more chilled out today than usual but otherwise she is completely normal this was honestly a good bonding experience in the end and im glad it went well but please dont feed your dog acid this was terrifying for me and it could have gone terribly thank you to everyone who supported and gave me tips you guys are awesome

15.34042,23.628258,Addicted,"so i was catching up with psychedsubstance earlier and got the idea that smoking dmt would be a fun time tonight now a few important notes of background im taking a low dose of the antidepressant venlafaxine so i didnt know how much the deems would affect me i had also done a lot of mdma the night before which sorta worked in weird ways and i had smoked two fat bowls of weed earlier in the day

anyway i totally eyeball a dose at a guess it was maybe around 60mg and take one huge toke which i hold in for as long as possible i blow out the window of my bedroom but apparently this isnt good enough because the smell stinks out our entire house im definitely feeling it i go and lie down on a soft bed and fold inwards experiencing lots of wonky dimensions and flashing psychedelic colours morphing into pulsating fractals

it is only a few minutes into the experience when my dad comes into my room asking about the smell i sorta just look at him and shakily murmur a few words not quite sure what i said im seeing his face rippling with ever changing iridescent colours i flop down and cuddle up to him for a bit which he thinks is pretty weird but goes along with it and then he leaves

a few more minutes pass and then both my mum and my dad come in asking about the smell i just look up at them and tell them plain and simple that im smoking dmt its an incredibly powerful hallucinogen and i didnt mean to stink the house out they both ask if i feel alright i say yeah im fine and then i tell them what the experience is like i even ask if either of them want to do it my mum looks quite tempted but in the end they pass and leave me to it

they honestly were fine with it they thought it was quite a funny situation and said that as long as i was safe it was all cool maybe just go in the garden next time though

i ride the rest of the trip out becoming one with the blankets and mattresses i even go back to finish off the bowl and lightly trip a bit more

then i guess i went on reddit to rake in upvotes lol"

12.233815,5.0451727,Addicted,"one night in the middle of winter my friends mom was out of town so me and a group of 5 friends went to his house for a night of shrooms none of our usual dealers were coming through so we try a new number just our luck he lives just down the road we go get the shrooms come back to the house and eat up

as we start coming up everyone is having a great time except the host i can tell hes starting to get into a thought loop as he keeps saying things like didnt you just say that and thats where you come in referring to the next person speaking and my personal favorite thats the loop he somehow manages to rope someone else into his loop and they start talking about all these wild theories together

our one friend k is really good at calming people down so she starts taking care of them while the other 3 of us go out to his shed to smoke we had a vinyl player in there and we listened to favorite worst nightmare by arctic monkeys the visuals were like a neon disco all the posters were super vibrant it was fucking gorgeous we sat in there and talked for probably half an hour then decided to head in

as we enter the back door its utter chaos the host and his companion are walking quickly about the house gathering random items and yelling about some shit then they run out the front door with k following them we ask her what the fuck is going on and she just says im fine theyre not ill take care of them dont worry so we let them go out into the snowy night and have fun and go on youtube on the hosts xbox

when we hit search the last search was vsauce does the past exist and the last watched video was did the past really happen by vsauce

this fucking video sent these guys off the rails for 3 and a half hours goddamn you michael stevens

4.819014,4.4483128,Addicted,last week i was tripping on acid and i was sitting on a chair in the corner of my room looking at the rest of it i thought it looked so cool i wanted to take a visual picture of it so i could draw it when i was sober so i tried really hard to look at it and take a visual picture of everything i was seeing then i couldnt unsee it like on a camera when you take a picture and it comes up on the screen after youve taken it i was getting a bit worried and trying to think of how i could get rid of the image and get my eyesight back and then i realised i was just still looking in the same place i had been
9.357791,9.235181,Recovering,"might get slaughtered for this but here we go

as someone who used weed almost daily for a year i finally decided to quit about 2 months ago tbh weed was just getting dull as hell and i just wasnt enjoying it anymore it was just a crutch maybe due to tolerance 

after quitting i was pretty determined not to smoke again but i kept coming in and out of these bouts of almost depressionlike states every week or so the thing i did notice was that i was far more clear headed than i was before i know its a cliché but i feel like weed really made me lose motivation for a lot of things in hindsight but at the time i didnt realise its almost as if i was blind to the negative effects and only realised upon quitting 

now i feel like i can think a lot clearer about things i am motivated to exercise i get a lot more joy from things such as sports games and my sober music appreciation is at an alltime high 

for all the people who i know will reply oh yeah but some people can smoke all the time and still be motivated and get shit done well i did too but maybe you should try quitting for a while and see if your standard of living improves 

cheers

-9.670757,0.83540976,Recovered,"you are what you do not what you think what you think you do 

it’s easy to get caught up on your racing thoughts and some genius ideas that you had that you never really followed through on it’s easy for you to understand you are a smart person and that you have unlimited potential but if you never actually do shit you will never be shit to anyone who hasn’t already established a deep relationship with you 


if you work a 10 hour job and make good money for your family but you come home disconnected and just do your medicines and never actually  do anything for them your family will find it hard to love you no matter how much you think you deserve it 

i wanted to post in this sub because a lot of us who use and medicate tend to only pay close attention to what’s going on in your own head and not to the people around you i know what i said will be obvious to some but i know there are plenty of people who need this reminder right now 

pay attention to the people around you and that they’re good look outward as much as you look inward and sacrifice your time and physical well being for others it will be well worth it in the long run"
9.399763,4.1910267,Recovering,so i smoked for a bit and then had the strongest munchies and was craving chinese food as i walked up to this joint that had two young asians in their early 20s working behind the counter i was super excited to order i went straight to them and yelled  i would like an order of chicken with vegetables they looked at me and said this is a mexican place we dont sell chinese food here i didnt understand so i thought maybe i should try again i walked out the place read the name on the sign and it said yummy taco but when i looked at the two young asians working there i reminded myself oh yes they sell chinese food so i walked back in and asked for the same order this time with please they said it says yummy taco we dont have chinese food  at this point i finally realized their scheme looked them dead in the eyes and blurted  wow you guys are trolls i walked out with a smile today i am red in the face and ashamed
12.339361,11.9539,Addicted,"so i recently went on a trip to tokyo for two weeks and i decided long ago that i wanted to bring some lsd now i spent a lot of time worrying and researching ways to smuggle it into japan i know lsd is the easiest drug to smuggle which is why i was even considering this in the first place but i was still nervous considering you can get 10 years for like a tenth of a gram of weed there 

eventually i settled on a method i just put a bunch of random garbage in my wallet receipts gum wrappers etc i put the tab in a gum wrapper and slid that particular one in between my cash i got through all the security and customs just fine without even having to open my wallet anyway but i was still mad nervous haha once i got to japan i made sure to put on a long sleeve shirt to cover my tattoo just to ensure customs didnt pay any extra attention to me since tats arent exactly socially accepted there just yet 

so anyway about a week into the the trip i decided it was time to trip the weather was nice and i just wanted to do it i dropped that tab at like 10 or 11 am it was a goblins den tab if that means anything to you  the comeup was pretty hard at one point but its nothing i cant handle as ive done up to 1000ug before i hung out in the airbnb with my friends while we all got ready to head out once i was nearing the peak and everyone was ready we set out to the skytree 

for those of you who arent aware the skytree is the 2nd tallest building in the entire world looking out over the largest city in the world it was a bit of a long train ride from where we were staying but i held my cool on the train with no issues we made it to the skytree and by this point i was tripping pretty fucking hard i was relying on my friends to navigate and get me where i needed to go we paid for our tickets and got into a crowded fucking elevator which wasnt very fun and we go to the top and what a fucking view it was a lot of people like to take psychedelics  in nature and feel a greater connection to the earth myself included but my god man standing on that tower looking out over the fucking massive urban jungle that is tokyo is breathtaking just insane it really made me think about how much human beings have done and how far weve come from being hunter gatherers to taking control of our destiny as a species i mean it took us thousands of years to learn to fly and then 66 years later we put a man on the fucking moon the moon bitch after enjoying the view and having my mind blown we went over to the skytree and i got some of the best goddamn soft serve ice cream ive ever had and continued to enjoy the view while eating 


after all that we left and headed back home and i enjoyed the rest of my trip by walking around our cool little neighborhood listening to some music overall a very great experience it was very strange walking around high as shit seeing fuckin japanese everywhere what a cool looking language "
-14.485066,14.371237,NA,"i love to read stories trip reports people making stupid posts while high on anything people wanting to chat with random strangers while being high and all of that stuff its just that some of you are real toxic ill show with examples by what im talking about

example 1

post i took 2 tabs of lsd and im tripping hard i just wanted to say that this is life is great and have a good night

comments dude if you are on 2 tabs you wouldnt be able to type when i tripped on 2 tabs i saw my 3rd eye growing out of my dick and was paralyzed for two weeks youre probably some kid using drugs isnt cool grow up cringe

whats wrong here now this isnt a quality post but the person just wants to spread some positive vibes theres nothing wrong with that if you cant know for certain that its fake then dont comment at all even if it is fake then why should you comment its not like its hurting anyone with that post only thing youre doing is making him feel bad and potentially ruining his trip 

what you could comment have a nice trip  

example 2

post how to get heroin out of water

comments stop using heroin its shit and youll kill yourself kill yourself for using it

whats wrong here you may think that that is harm reduction but its not your comment doesnt help anything other than induce frustration the sub is designed to be an all drug subreddit if you just smoke weed and drop acid etc and think youre on some sort of pedestal for it then go to rtrees 

what you could comment nothing if you dont know anything about heroin 

example 3

post i hate alcohol i love weed

comments yeah way to go alcohol sucks dick its so much more harmful why cant the general public see this 

whats wrong here the alcohol is bad circlejerk is pretty common in all drug subreddits there is some truth behind it but most of the stuff i see about it is just wrong and ignorant same goes for the cigarettes is bad circlejerk this is a all drug subreddit were not here to discriminate other drug users legal or illegal harm reduction posts are very fine and encouraged what im talking about is the circlejerk behind it without any actual content 

what you could comment i see your point and i agree with you but there are also health benefits to using alcohol and its a fun drug  i also think alcohol is bad like other humans here and i do not enjoy it at all glad we came to a human agreement about this subject humans discuss

example 4

post im 15 and i have a question about drugs

comments omg this subreddit is being taken over by kids abandon ship everyone i dont want to live on this gay planet anymore

whats wrong here kids are really passionate to learn new stuff drugs being one of them for most please help them to make to best decisions so that they wont make mistakes that they regret or that could ruin their lives forever drugs arent toys and should be taken seriously so if you are a kid and have a question about some drug that you plan on taking please dont be afraid to ask there are plenty of people who have good knowledge and expertise on these substances and taking the extra hour to see some responses could really make a difference between a great night and a bad one one mistake i made as a kid was smoking weed and taking acid for the first time and i wish i wouldve made a post asking if its a good combo for the first time its not and if its your first time dont do it

what you could comment the answer to the question to the best of your abilities also if you see wrong information given out please try to correct it


now these are just my suggestions on how you should behave in this sub agree or dont also to posters try not to make the most idiotic threads imaginable but if you absolutely must then fine i myself have done some of this stuff im not perfect but im making a conscious effort on reducing it and i hope you will too this is a harm reduction subreddit almost everyone has some problems here with life i wish that you all could be understanding about everyones behavior even if it gets annoying or if theres incorrect information people could correct it and be civilized about it lets not forget that we are all just humans and all humans are stupid animals

peace

edit its great to see everyone agreeing on this topic one thing i would like to say is that if you see this type of behavior in this sub or anywhere else dont be afraid to speak out against it its a collective effort to make this sub as friendly as possible i like to imagine this sub as being a safe place to ask about topics i cant google about or reading other peoples experiences on certain drug combinations and sharing your mistakes without being judged

edit 2 example 5 thanks uolderdruggie 

postcomments i took a certain drugcombination it worked in a certain way so i expect it will work same for everyone

whats wrong here people assuming that because certain drugs and combinations at certain doses have affected them in a particular way that this must be so for everyone else each person will react in their own way to various substances based upon the dose their tolerance their setting and mindset among many other things even erowidorg states in several places something to the effect of how 5 people in the same set the same setting each taking the same dose of the same potency of a drug may in fact have drastically different experiences this is kind of similar to the example 1 but example one talks about skepticism

what to comment assume that your drug experiences were all unique and only give a blurry picture on what are the effects of the drug there are countless of factors to be taken into account and you can never list them all in a comment so take everyones advice with a grain of salt

2.7491398,2.1647744,NA,"so i’m just chilling in my baggie being a powdered substance rattling around in the purse of this thicc girl and i don’t really know what’s going on at all it’s dark as shit in there and i can only hear the odd muffled voice

anyway i hear this chick and her friend arrive somewhere and stop driving then a minute later they’re laughing hysterically so i know some shits going down i’m practically clumping together in excitement who’s nose am i going up please tell me i’m gonna be laid out on some smooth flat mirrored surface and insufflated through a crisp 100 bill oh boy

there’s more rustling as i’m carried very slowly up what feels like hundreds of stairs and finally i’m lay down on a soft surface still in the purse

“saucy ladles” i think i hear or something like that i absentmindedly take a glance to the left of me and notice through the plastic that there’s a few cheetos in the thicc chicks purse this makes me ponder life

suddenly i’m being ripped out of the purse by a pair of podgy hands oh boy am i excited

lay me on a table

spread me on a dvd case

line me up on a laserdisc

i can’t wait fooh god jesus no

thicc lady is laying me out onto the flaccid tiny smegmastained chode of a man who looks like he’s made of more coke than i am and not the sort you snort 

i can taste his essence i am become smeg suddenly two nostrils are heading towards me

i pray for death i pray to be taken into the nasal cavities of these two beached dolphins but it is not to be

for the sudden proximity of females to this “man’s” previously untrodden todger proves to be too much for him and he begins to swell gloriously in size the sudden growth scattering me across the room and mixing me with the red cheesey dust that he calls a “carpet” his once tiny flaccid member now stands at an impressive 36” inches and i am alone and defeated

“is that cheeto dust” wide friend asks

“yeh” erection man replies

“awesome” wide says and begins to suck the red mist from his chode moments later he spews thick rope after rope of pentup semen into her mouth and shooting across the floor

most of it lands on me

there is no roommate noone was telling the truth this day

i am never seen again coke only in name cheetodust semen now in chemical makeup

11.318677,6.4854293,Addiction-prone,"i posted this on tifu but it got removed so i’m moving it here

late saturday night i was bored so i decided to do some coke to kill some time well one thing about coke is that when you do some you crave more and for some reason in my world of wonderful ideas i thought i should try sniffing some flakka i had lying around back when i used to sell it same thing as coke right 

i did a few lines when  a single dose is supposed to be 1 and felt ecstatic so ecstatic i decided to download grindr and have as much gay sex as possible i’ve never felt any attraction towards men in my life before last night bear in mind i ended up finding someone to hook up with and i took an uber to their apartment complex my phone died as soon as i got there so i spent the next 1520 minutes knocking on random doors that were close to what i could remember was the apartment number i ended up walking to the nearest gas station 2 miles away and charging my phone and then walking back i found the guys place and proceeded to try to have sex with him i say try because my dick was not working at all and had no chance of working so i ended up giving him head fun after he was thoroughly freaked out and told me to go i proceeded to find guy 2 

i found guy 2 and took an uber to his house basically the same situation as guy 1 finished that and went to guy 3 repeat except add extortion through kinda intimidation in the mix i ended up bullying the guy out of 20 thank god he didn’t call the cops otherwise we wouldn’t have gotten to the final guy guy 4 

after getting rejected from multiple hotels for looking like the crackhead that i was i found one and met guy 4 guy 4 was a little different he wanted me to humiliate him and tie him up never been into bondage but hey i guess on bath salts anything is possible so ended up doing that for a little while after unsuccessfully finding someone else for the night i decided to call it quits and head home

i’m still uncoordinated and very scared i may have caused irreparable brain damage this has been the worst two days of my life 

tldr snorted bath salts went on a wacky gay adventure possible brain damage


update feeling pretty much back to normal at this point thank you bath salt jesus i feel no real attraction to men at this point again so i’m not sure i’ll be experimenting anymore thank you guys for reading"

   first time smoking crack cocaine how much do you usually smoke



notatweakeranymoreurl   24 points  ·  28 days agourl  
  
  
  
usually smoke im going to tell you how this will go down young freebase apprentice  
  
  
  
  
  
usual harm reduction practices dictate that one start low and go with the flow this is not true for crack you dont want to get an underwhelming hit thats just waste of crack and that shit is expensive you know  
  
  
  
  
  
you want to try three match head sized rocks remember to pulverize them and load hold the hit in for at min 30  max 45 seconds after 45 you will not get any higher just a buzz from the asphyxiation  
  
  
  
  
  
if you are pro you will get 8 hours of euphoria out of a gram but i will tell you how much you will smoke  
  
  
  
  
  
you will smoke it all you will then check your bag for any overseen little crack pebble left behind then you will go on your knees on your carpet with a flashlight to look for anything you may or may not have dropped you will look for leftovers for an hour or so refusing to accept that there isnt anymore here comes the panic phase you will cry internally or externally maybe both you will be the saddest youve ever been that the crackcoaster came to a stop you were just getting warmed up you feel  
  
  
  
  
  
you will then call the plug to get another pizza with everything after you eaten that pizza you will order another one with extra everything for your new neversatisfied appetite you are becoming a pizza enthusiast you will spend all your cash you will then spend everything on your primary account then your saving account the pension account you will max the overdraw on all of the cards while you still got good credit you may consider taking the biggest loan you can in order to keep the euphoria going when that tit is milked you may want to pawn your xbox your vinyl collection is worth a lot more if you sell it on discogs one at a time but you dont have that time pawn them all too continue doing this with your personal belongings until you only own a mattress and a night stand for your yeyo paraphernalia  
  
  
  
  
  
now you have nothing and want to keep the adventure going its time to drain your nearest call your dad and tell him that things are rough the bill whatever bill needs to be payed the car fixed and you want to propose to your girlfriend because now is the right time and rings are expensive express your sincerest gratitude thanks dad you are the best tell him you dont want to make mom worried so if it could be your little secret it would be the best for the family when the base your dad sponsored is out go call your mom give her the same speech and tell her that you dont want to make dad worried you are now getting good at the creative side of crack addiction  
  
  
  
  
  
now lets see how much your best friends trust your cracksmoking ass go get coffee with them because you really have something you need to ask him get him the caffeine sit down and then start singing the blues tell him about your medical condition you want to evoke sympathy if you are good friends getting a good amount of crackcash should not be too hard you havent told anyone about your medical problems and per extension the medical bill this will also be your secret and tell him that you are blessed having such a good good friend now go melt dat yeyo you will have toptier euphoria for weeks do this with all the close friends and you are now ready for fucking over secondary acquaintances  
  
  
  
  
  
you know that richkid from highschool that were so fucking flat uninteresting and underwhelming as a person he resorted to buyingbribing his friends for company hes your new bff you are now into the this game beyond the point of no return you will know how to fuck him over yourself by now after you are done with him its time to be creative here comes my favorite way to feed your bazookahabit  
  
  
  
  
  
some people go other their boundaries when they get desperate enough you may have heard of the term crackwhore well you will never have to live with that stigma listen here you are a good looking boy right and there are a lot of lonely old and sexually frustrated men out there you will pose a a rentboy out there your creativity decides how much you will make brand yourself as a luxury escort when you catch a perv you will get him to come to your place throw him a dudaddress an hour before your midnight affair pop a xanax kpin or some other effective anxiolytica you will have no problems with inhibition greet him lure him to a safe place and fucking mug the thirsty prick he wont go to the police he will be way too ashamed trust me its what i like to call a cunning stunt and can be repeated infinitely and you will feel morally justified for doing it go get them  
  
  
  
  
  
sorry for going on about this the amp is clearly working my point is that if you start doing crack and like it you wont stop before you are either bankrupt or dead you are going to lose everything in the hunt of that overwhelming yet short acting euphoria nuke  
  
  
  
  
  
experience i almost ruined my life in two months doing freebase all day every day spending around 10000 dollars on cocaine and converting it to freebase with ammonia on a fucking spoon interesting times but not worth it felt nice but really not worth it   
  
  
  
  
  
if you got this far down this damn text wall go look up the crack megathread on bl its a comprehensive guide to getting the most out of your crack the original post describes the mythical bellringer a hit   close like an overdose   that will leave you paralyzed with euphoria for a good 45 minutes compared to the usual 1015 minute euphoria you get from a regular hit he also goes on to describe how he is of a lonely breed the functional crack addict and how he maintains its highly controversial even for bl its worth a read

11.921683,0.35135013,NA,"this happened a couple hours ago it was my high schools homecoming game and everyone was there a lot of people come in baked or a little drunk which is really no big deal 

anyway i was with some friends and we sat down at a table by the field with another group of people at it one of my friends knew one of the girls in the group and was friends with her but this girl was seriously fucked up like cant even walk talk or count the amount of fingers your holding up fucked 

my friend is trying to keep her from passing out so shes talking to her and telling her to count her fingers and look at her eyes and shit which she cant even do so after a minute or so she throws up all over my friend and passes out in a puddle of her own vomit so im like we need to move this girl so she doesnt throw up choke and die so we move her head to the side

at this point im asking her friends what she took and they seemed fucked up as well and the only answers i got out of them were alcohol and molly and other unspecified drugs after hearing alcohol and molly i knew it was a bad combo so i said fuck this she needs help im calling 911 her friends are all telling me not to call because shell get in trouble but honestly wtf its better than dying 

her friends leave as soon as i call and it just me and the group of my 3 other friends with this girl the adults working there step in and we lay her on the ground and at this point the police and ambulance is here so we leave it to them theyre slapping her in the face and shaking her but shes not responding and i start to get worried cause it looks really bad i think they started doing cpr but then stopped and carried her out into the ambulance

i have no idea if shes ok but im sure if anything bad happened ill hear about it on monday it just blows my mind how people are so irresponsible with their drug use like damn is it really that hard to not take too much and mix drugs that shouldnt be mixed i did the right thing right

23.760946,0.21305662,Addicted,"i’ve been addicted to opiates for about 6 years but for the past 3 years i was an iv heroin and meth addict and i got high everyday and when i say everyday i mean everyday i also went to a methadone clinic for the first year i had a good job and was able to afford it but i eventually lost my job which led me to doing all kinds of things to make money  and many i’m not proud ofi know i’m a shitty person for doing these things  and i know its wrongi’m 5 months clean off heroin and meth so i no longer do this stuff but i just want to tell my story on how i mostly supported my habit  some may find it interesting  

every so often my mom would give me a little money here and there but definitely not enough to support the habit i had  so i had to come up with ways to make it myself  the most easiest way i made money and what i did the most  was simply driving my best friend around  i dated this girl about 6 years ago  but we figured out we were better just as friends and we both got strung out on drugs together  she was the first person i injected drugs with  i’m 21 and she’s 28

as we got bad off in our addiction she became a prostituteshe lived with her father in the ghetto and had 2 kids  during the day from when they got out of school and until they went to bed around 9pm she was usually at home with them but from 9pm
until 700 am when they had to catch the bus is when she worked  

i would take her on outcalls all night long  and the deal was  we keep gas in the car  keep cigarettes and the rest goes on heroin and we split it 5050  she didn’t do meth  just heroin  she charged 160 an hour  120 for a half hour  or 80 for a qv 95 of the calls were qv’s 

a qv stands for “quick view” and it basically means  just long enough to make the guy cum so in most cases a qv only ranged from 515 minutes no longer for us it was the best deal because she could knock them out really fast  and we could get a half gram of heroin for 80 and that was enough to start us out for the night  

if we didn’t have dope you could talk her down to 60 for a qv and if we were dopesick she would do it for 40 but that was rareit’s definitely happened a few times  but only if we were desperate  we always mixed all the heroin up together and split it between two syringes  she usually got anywhere from 310 calls a night  3 would be a slow night and 6 would be an average night  and 10 would be a good night most nights we would make around 200 being the lowest 400600 being normal and 1000 being a good night  we’ve made 2000 a few nights  but that was very rare  luckily we never had any trouble with the police did have alot of sketchy dealings though  

i never went dope sick when i was rolling with her  we might of woke up dope sick  but it didnt stay that way for long  for some reason  people don’t do much during the day time  it would be pretty rare for her to go on a call during the day time  it was mostly always from 2am5am some days she wouldn’t have good luck and we’d have to do other things 

there’s been many occasions where we would wake up sick  and have no money or anything  in those cases i would drive my car from gas station to gas station and ask people for “gas money” i was very good at talking to people  and selling my storyof course not everyone gives you money  but for the most part  i was always able to get what i needed  out of all my friends  i was the best at doing this  because i’m pretty quick on my feet  i’m able to look people right in the eye and tell them a 100 bullshit story not stutter one word and make them believe it

i mostly sold the same story everytime”i’m almost out of gas  left debit card at home  do you have 1 or 2 dollars i could have for gas  or even any changei’m just trying to make it home anything counts” there’s small things you can do to ‘sell your story’ like look for change in your car while your talking to them carry a gas jug etc depending on the person  the story would vary  but to make it short that’s it  i could always make 40 in 2 hours max  but most of the time within 1 hour  that’s all we ever needed was just 40

if i didn’t feel like begging  because it’s degrading and somedays i just wasn’t up for it  i would go to walmart  my golden rule was to never walk out with something you didn’t pay foras long as you paid something  there is a box of vitamins in walmart that are 34 for one box  and there is another kind that’s the same brand name for 4 i would peal the barcode off of the 4 box and place it over the top of the 34 box barcode and go to the self checkout  hell sometimes i would go to a regular checkouti’ve never been caught doing this

you can return anything to walmart without a receipt but you must have an idyou can get a cash refund for any item under 40 and anything over 40 you will get a gift card  i would buy a box for 4 and take it to another walmart and return it for 32 as long as somebody had their idyou can only do it 3x a month but i always got a friend or somebody to return it  

if you have a receipt you don’t need an id so when i didn’t have an id i would find a receipt for something around 30 in the parking lot  go in and put a cheap barcode over the top of the items barcode buy whatever it was for around 35 and return it with the receipt and get cash back  

if i needed a bunch of money  i would go to the fishing pole section  and get a 100 fishing pole  and peel the barcode off of a 15 pole  and put it over the 100 poles barcode  return the pole at another walmart and get a 100 gift card  and then go to the walmart gas pumps  and find somebody that would pay me cash to pump their gas for them  it’s kind of lengthy  but i could earn a couple hundred bucks a day doing that  

it sounds goofy replacing the barcode  but it’s just wayy easier to get caught actually stealing something  than it is to “buy” it  i’ve done this hundreds of times and never have been caught once but you can’t be obvious about it  and you have to be slick  or you will get caught

we ate fast food everyday and 75 of the time we didn’t pay for it  i’d call and tell a restaurant i came last week and got such and such  and was missing one burger  and that i was coming for a replacement  i’d always tell them that i called back that same day  and talked to somebody and they wrote my name downgive them a fake name  you can only ask for one burger thoughif you get greedy it won’t work

the trick is  you have to be confident  and talk to them like it really happenedyou can’t be sketchy  or iffy about it  you just have to be able to talk fast  and make them actually believe iti was great at thisit would work 710 timesevery time we did pay for food  we kept the receipt  so when we called and fed them the story  we could actually have a receipt and then it would definitely work we survived off of this 

of course we pawned all of our stuff of any value  and did a lot of middle manning  but these are just a few stories of some of our schemes that people don’t usually hear about 

i know all this is shady stuff  and i’m ashamed of itand i know it’s wrong  but desperate times call for desperate measuresa hard drug addiction will make you do some terrible things  you’d never do in your right mindthere’s no need to comment on here and tell me i’m a piece of shit lowlife junkie  because i already know that

i just figured a lot of people would be curious how a lot of junkies are able to make money on the streets for drugs without a job  and this is how a lot of them make ita lot of people i know and hang around with do these same things most of my friends like robbing houses and stealing and robbing people for drugs but i never liked taking things from somebodya multimillion dollar corporation yeah i don’t care  but as far as breaking in a persons house and taking all their stuff and robbing people for their dope nah

i’ve been ripped off before  and i’ve worked a hard labor job for almost 4 years so i know how it is to work hard for something and then have it stolen from you  and it’s the worst feeling i don’t do shit like thati could easily make more money by breaking in houses and cars and robbing people for dope  or “robbing tricks” which is what a lot of prostitutes do  but i just wasn’t okay with doing thathope y’all enjoy

i just read a post about a person whos dad is a cop and caught them with weed so now their dad doesnt know what to do and says he will enforce police dogs to make sure there child is out of trouble

you gotta realize that your parents have seen a lot more than you have in their days my dad is very anti drugs and hates me smoking weed but thats because he grew up and saw alot of his friends go down dark roads of hard addiction so he doesnt want me to do that because he cares about me i may be mad at him but i realize its out of the good of his heart

i dumped the coke on the table in to one surprisingly perfect looking megaline and grabbed baking soda and chopped that in to a line dont worry i licked the phone right before this so no cocaine waste and grabbed a bottle and put vinegar in to it

went back outside performed the fun trick for the kids it fizzed and they were pleased and my neighbours suspicions if he had any were put to rest i went back inside rolled a 5 bill and railed the fat line on my kitchen table and started writing this

so last night im on my computer playing cimsity4 drinking my old bell ipa like every night when i get a snapchat from my meth dealer 

now me and the soon to be ex hore love our meth but there is a difference between us 2 i can control my use she cant hers so usually i pick up and distribute small amounts to her at a time 

i thought oh hes probably just high because he usually doesnt text me out of nowhere he starts asking me weird questions like if i have plans it was tuesday at 1130 pm and hell hook me up fat 

now ive always known my dealer was a trip but not this level of weird his entire life is a front with him as a stay at home dad and he gives his kids valium 

anyway he asked me to cum over yes exact quote saying he will smoke me down me being a meth addict and all was at his house in under 10 minutes even though its a good 20 minute walk needless to say i was not expecting this at all 

i get in the door and instantly 2 men grab me one is my dealer they tie me up with rope and start hitting me in the face with a lampshade which only hurt my ego

it is at this moment that i look up and see my girl friend hanging from the ceiling no joke laughing and watching 

now what i didnt tell you guys before is that im into pegging and my girl used to peg me a lot i guess she thought i would be ok with a guys dick in my ass too

but anyway the guys are taking off their pants and im not only thinking their gonna kill me but i just started getting so confused and then my girlfriend told me the whole story right there 

i guess she offered my dealer my butthole in exchange for 50 sack off crystal and her getting fucked too not in the ass 

it was then that i jumped up kicked my dealers in the sack and ran back to my house with only underwear and shoes on with my hands tied behind my back with literal rope 

havent seen the cunt since yesterday she hasnt came home yet shes probably allowing them to rape her anyway if she comes up im waiting with a shotgun"

-9.305616,0.80374265,Addicted,"if you are horribly burned in a fire you can take drugs to relieve the pain if you shatter your spine you can take drugs to relieve the pain if you are addicted to drugs and your life has turned to utter and total shit you can take drugs to relieve the pain

and thats how the trap works 

imagine if the only cure for burn pain was fire imagine if the cure for back pain was whacking yourself in the spine with a hammer the drug addict is caught in an analogous situation the only fast reliable remedy for the psychological pain of drug addiction is drugs there are other cures a notable one is not doing drugs but they are all slower and less reliable

somehow the lure of feeling better now overrides the hope of feeling better later this is the basic mechanism of addiction the behavior of an addict is perfectly logical in the short term and perfectly illogical in the long term because life exists in the long term addiction is illogical overall what is surprising how easily addiction can ensnare people who are perfectly intelligent and selfdisciplined

you can go to certain parts of any sizable city in america and watch drugs addicts totter around looking at their blighted faces their filthy clothes their total lack of selfregard you would be forgiven for thinking that they lack selfdiscipline how could you think otherwise when a person cant be bothered to shower much less get a proper job or just stop smoking crack for more than a few hours what else could you call it but a lack of selfdiscipline

imagine the nazi troops at stalingrad encircled by the soviet troops fighting against total annihilation would you look at these troops these underslept unshaven men in stinking unwashed clothes and accuse them of lacking selfdiscipline would you say tuttut these nazis are an undisciplined lot of course not you would understand that their shabby state is not from a lack of selfdiscipline but rather because they are concerned with other things dire things

while there are several notable differences between nazi soldiers and crack heads the same principle is in effect for both for both there has been a terrible reordering of priorities the showering the clean clothes the job all of these become secondary to fast access to the drug if showering and clean clothes got them fast access to the drug they would walk around looking like a detergent commercial you would never see whites so white

but they dont need clean clothes they dont need showers they need drugs the drugs are the solution to everything

highly selfdisciplined people are actually quite vulnerable to drug addiction it is because they believe that they need to control their feelings they often seek to simply eliminate bad feelings just as they seek to eliminate underperformance from every other area of their lives the demon of addiction looks at their grand selfdiscipline and giggles with glee it knows that it will be precisely this selfdiscipline that will bring them to heel they will selfdiscipline themselves right into total obedience to the drug

as an example look at prince and michael jackson were they selfdisciplined definitely the world has hardly seen such selfdiscipline they were obsessive workaholics devoted to their careers and they propelled themselves to the very pinnacle of professional success they both knew the dangers of drug addiction and fastidiously avoided drugs keep in mind avoiding drugs in 1980s hollywood must have been like avoiding water in a swimming pool at the bottom of the fucking ocean yet they managed to do it for a while because they had selfdiscipline

now they are both dead they were both destroyed by drug addiction in the end selfdiscipline was not enough to save them why not because selfdiscipline is just a talent an accomplishment and like any other talent or accomplishment it can be turned and made to serve the dark master

what then is our defense against this menace what is the answer

now any time i see anything about addiction like on tv or in the news or even if i spot someone when i go out who i can tell now that i know what im seeing is an addict it literally breaks my heart on the spot  i cant take any of it lightly  the weight of the devil on their backs is something i can see now almost like a 6th sense  when everyone else is percieving the situation with a passing glance my heart is going out to these people who suffer this burden that nobody else seems to understand and nobody can do anything about  its so fucked up

they told me the only thing worse than being an addict is being in love with one but i wasnt prepared for how it would affect me after our relationship ended  i just wanted to get that off my chest and share it with any of you who might have dated people who didnt use left them in the dust and wondered if they really cared  she would do and say terrible things and then only notice the way i handled it when things were tough but never really understood the part she played in evolving or devolving our relationship in those moments

lie to everyone else in the world  live a double life if you have to  but if you have someone who loves you and will be there for you then for gods sake tell them the truth  no matter what  while you may be on a freight train of addiction chugging along with seemingly infinite fuel the ones who love you are desperately trying to hang on just to show you that the world isnt as callous and resentful as your addiction wants you to believe

im not going to lie and say its been easy its been anything but from losing people i believed to be close friends my brother included losing a social aspect of my life that i believed was essential paying out a substantial amount of money at the start of each month to pay back my debts this has been the toughest year of my life but i just wanted to say if you are reading this and struggling theres hope out there for you too if the traditional methods like na dont work for you dont worry they dont work for everyonei had to break the cycle of using admitting id used paying the debt and repeat before i could ever get to this stage

2.1351132,10.180855,NA,"i am reading recovery 2017 by russell brand and it is a perfect adaptation of the 12 steps as they apply to the various manifestations of addiction i think this is valuable because most 12 step programs address only one type of addiction and it is very common for people with addiction issues to quickly turn to something else this can result in less harm but the underlying issues dont get adequately addressed and people stay stuck in maladaptive habits for the rest of their lives

russell brand takes a more holistic approach he also provides some great alternatives for understanding the concept of a higher power

his version of the twelve steps are minimalist insightful and spot on as follows

step 1 are you a bit fked 

step 2 could you not be fked 

step 3 are you on your own going to unfk yourself 

step 4 write down all the things that are fucking you up or have ever fucked you up and dont lie or leave anything out

    if even one person relates to my story or if it helps anyone i will feel like it was not all for nothing  so here we go  fair warning this is not a nice story  its gritty dark and sometimes upsetting  however there is a silver lining in every dark cloud so bare with me
     i was about 5 years old when my mother told me my father was allergic to beer for the first time  i have two older sisters who up until then fought to protect me from our awful truth that my father was an alcoholic and an addict  i would tell my friends and teachers elaborate tales of my father being in the army or that he worked at disney land when he would be absent for weeks at a time  you never understand how someone could leave their children ruin their own life for a drink or a substance  i pray some of you never have to understand
     he would have periods of sobriety throughout our lives  eviction notices or a missing tv came like a slap in the face when you realize those periods of sobriety were periods of deception  they would turn out to be periods where we were blinded by hope that things would finally be ok  he was fighting for his life and all we could do was watch and keep loving him
     i was 15 years old when i tried heroin for the first time  i remember how cool i felt  i wouldnt bother trying to cover my track marks in high school because i thought it made me a badass  my entire group of friends did dope so it felt normal  people also always needed me to get it for them and it made me feel important  i have terrible anxiety and i had the choice to make it go away with one shot of that liquid gold
     one of my older sisters was also an addict so when the day came that i woke up with what i thought was the flu she knew what was really happening  she told me to do some dope and see if i felt better and i did  within seconds of it pumping through my veins it was like i was a different person  the goosebumps the sweat the knots of cramps in my stomach all gone in one second
     from then on i was in constant fear of running out of my medicine  yes i called the killer drug that is heroin my medicine  i stole from everyone i cared about  i remember the look on my mothers face when she found out why her money or jewelry always came up missing  i have done this too long with your father i will not go through this with you girls  me and my sister tried to stay clean but heroin was now everywhere  i had gotten almost every one of my friends hooked already it was just too hard
     highschool ended with me going to jail for the first time  drug possession and shoplifting  my mom paid the 2500 bond and took me straight from county jail to rehab  my first go at rehab was a complete joke  i didnt try at all  heroin had become my best friend and anything in the way of that friendship was nothing i wanted to hear about
     i finally got discharged from probation unsuccessfully but all i heard was that i was discharged  i didnt care about the felony being stuck on my record  it was the first definitely not the last  
     i got clean for the first time shortly after  i met the love of my life the one man who has stuck by my side through everything and got pregnant  i had to go to back to jail while pregnant for old warrants i didnt know i had  after a little over a month my mom had come up with the 5 grand to get me out  i followed the rules until i had my son  i never used while pregnant thank you god
     my son david was 6 months old when i relapsed yet again  i was 21 at the time  my bond was forfeited when i never went back to court  so my mom lost the money she put up to get me out  i dove head first back into addiction  i finally understood how my dad could leave us for a substance  i sold my soul for heroin and did it with a smile on my face 
     i had never been so depressed  instead of teaching my son to walk i was with girls who didnt care about me in run down hotels barely surviving but hey at least i had my heroin  my sons father would beg me to come home  he would come searching for me if he had the slightest idea where i was
     i was on the run a little over 2 years until the cops finally got me  i had almost 40 bags of dope on me when i got picked up for my warrant  the beautiful thing about chicago is that i didnt get charged for the bags because one of the cops was clearly an addict himself and pocketed them
    my mom told me she couldnt pay another 5 grand so i sat  i sat until illinois sentenced me to 1 year in the department of corrections  i watched a woman hang herself my second week there  i lived with women that killed children  i lived with women that killed many people sat across from them at breakfast  the monsters you see on the news i shared a toilet with  
     i remember sitting the night before my out date just thanking god that i had an out date  so many women will never leave that place  some dont deserve to ever leave
     7 months of hell and i was released  you would think being on parole and just enduring that type of madness would make you stay clean  i got high after being out 5 days  again diving head first into the needle  i went on a couple month long binges until one day i realised im too tired to continue on this path
     my son got me clean this time around  he is now 3 years old and he can finally ask me to please stay home  please dont leave me again   he said that to me and its like i got slapped in the face with a memory of me begging my own father to do the same thing  he is one thing i love more then heroin  it just took me a long time to see that it was effecting him  heroin has a way of making you justify your actions  you dont realize how bad its gotten until you lose everything 
    i am listed as absconder from parole on the idoc inmate search which means on the run  i prayed that i could keep my promise of staying home but there was one more thing i had to do  i had to turn myself in to my parole officer  i was in her office begging for my life when she set the cup to pee in on the table  she told me you pass this drug test you go home  if you fail your going back to logan correctional center  because of my child i passed that drug test today  
     god gave me another chance  today my father has 6 years clean  my older sister has 7 months  i have 3 weeks and 2 days  i am finally sleeping at night and still have nightmares almost daily about relapsing  the future is never certain but just for today i am clean  thank you to my future husband my parents and most importantly my son for loving me until i could love myself 
     god willing i will stay strong and win this fight  if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction love them from a distance if you must but please dont stop loving them  i am always willing to talk or just listen if you have nobody  just muster up the strength to ask for help

11.623686,-5.5760856,NA,"i hope this helps someone else

ive previously read that the difficulty with battling food addiction is that we have to eat food however it wasnt until three months ago that everything sort of clicked for me after reading a random no name doctors blog talking about food addiction i dont have to eat carby the bad kind fatty starchy glorious cheesy delicious sugary food it seems to be rare that people are addicted to healthy foods to the point that it becomes an issue  i decided that if i wanted to get over my addiction i absolutely couldnt have junk food anymore and that i would treat this as seriously as  if i were trying to stop using cocaine example  people who are trying to overcome addiction to drugs dont have the mindset of okay im just going to have a little bit today and then not get anymore until next weekend and then living the rest of their life this way

in the past i would try to limit eating fast food to once a week id then find some way to justify getting it every day after that resulting in lost money immense guilt and pepto bismal chugging i finally had to come to the realization that im addicted to most junk food mostly fast food and that i really can never eat it again i could think of no pros for eating fast food multiple times daily none just like there are no pros for doing meth

ive been judged playfully and not so playfully by family friends and co workers i feel that i make people uncomfortable by taking an honest look at my eating habits and being fairly open about not being able to eat certain foodsgo out to dinner because of trying to get control of this to them its comical no junk food ever crazy

i can handle going out to eat in a restaurant about once a month and getting an appetizer with water any more than that and i start to itch for more ive been successful with redirecting some of my friends that always want to  have brunchlunchdinnerbreakfastsecond breakfastdinnersupper when we hang out and not so much with others its something ive learned to live with and im not going to let fomo keep me in the prediabetic range the food also makes my stomach uncomfortable now my body is starting to not know how to handle it

a seemingly famous example of all of this is al sharpton regardless of how you feel about his politics the man lost 200lbs by going completely cold turkey from junk food and by going on a very low calorie diet with healthy foods he  was poked fun of in the media for being too skinny when everyone first got a glimpse of him he curtly told the media that they shouldve worried about him when he was morbidly obese he says that he has more energy and sleeps a lot better i dont know if he was addicted to food but the methods that he used to lose weight and his continued mannerisms lead me to believe that maybe he was and that he knew he could never eat any of those foods again  he says he doesnt miss them at all and he didnt eat one piece of cake at his 60th birthday party

these 90 days have been tough but i can honestly say im making progress and dont miss the way the foods made me feel i have a loooooot of extra money and this just shows me how much i was spendingwasting im an abysmal cook and thats another feat all together

not everyone is like me and not everyone needs to completely give up junk food but if you have issues with control or if any of the above sounds like you consider going cold turkey on whatever foods it is thats got you messed up"

one reason i want to reach out is that recovering for meth can be extremely demoralizing i think its something chemical about that drug but i felt like i had lingering effects for 6months or more i felt like i would never stop having cravings i would get the taste of shooting up and it would last for ten twenty sometimes thirty minutes it just gets better over time and the literature on people with a fusion of meth and sex does not have very optimistic statistics on the possibility of recovering but stastics dont apply to the individual and im living proof of that 

i want to reach out to those of yall suffering out there give whatever support and hope i can because it can be done early recovery might be total hell but there is a life of joy freedom and ease on the other side of that hell we just have to stick together and take it one day at a time "

11.69322,-1.2512487,Recovering,"my husband and i will have a year clean in january woohoo and today was a weird day  we’ve both been fighting off a brutal cold for over two weeks this cold will not let up and just as we start to feel any improvement it takes back over and we’re dying again it’s by far the most persistent cold i’ve ever had we’re dead broke so we can’t afford over the counter medicine or anything so we’ve just been sucking it up i just started a new job the same time the cold hit us and calling out isn’t an option the last person who had my job was fired on day 4 for calling out and i need this job so going into work sick as a dog has been my life for weeks now it’s been miserable 

thanksgiving was great especially considering where i was last thanksgiving family wasn’t speaking to us i was either withdrawing or high and we didn’t eat anything which on thanksgiving was an especially painful reminder of how much of a fuck up i was being clean for thanksgiving this year is truly a gift for us cooking and eating and being a part of the family 

as my mom and i were about to leave to check out some black friday sales i heard my stepdad and my husband talking about how brutal this chest cold has been i chimed in about how awful it is my stepdad says the rest of my family had the same cold for about a month before he went to see his doctor we got the cold right after babysitting for them so we had a good idea that we caught it from them he says the meds they gave him cleared it right up and offers us of his leftover antibiotics 

we have no insurance and are broke as hell of course it’s stupid to accept someone else’s antibiotics but we’re desperate to get well and have to go to work try to go easy on us for accepting them we’re more than desperate to get back to our normal health 

i went shopping with my mom which was nice and obviously means a lot considering how broken our relationship was before i got clean 

i got back to my parents house and my husband and i head home with our grocery bag with our stockpile of left overs and cold meds once we’re home and throwing the leftovers in the fridge my husband asks if i want an antibiotic i pass because my stomach is empty at this point and taking one on an empty stomach is a nightmare we notice there’s another bottle in the bag i grab it and immediately see that it has bold print on the side caution opiate may cause drowsiness or dizziness 

guys my stepdad sent us home with a full bottle of lean wtf i’m like “babe did you know he sent this with us he says he asked my dad if any of it was narcotic when handed the bag and my stepdads response was “my doctor wouldn’t prescribe me anything like that i took it one time and it did make me a little sleepy be careful what time you take it”  so then we both had a trigger moment how easy would it be to play dumb and just take some no big deal right but we wised up and dumped it out 

my parents are well aware that we are in recovery and are usually supportive as they have seen us at our worst occasionally they slip up and offer us wine or beer and at one point my stepdad tried to convince my husband to drink because he’d “have a better time if he loosened up” and “he didn’t have to drive” i’m proud of my husband for declining to be fair my stepdad had his cataracts replaced 20 years ago and they were only supposed to last him about 10 so his eyesight isn’t perfect its possible he didn’t notice the opiate label but damn he couldn’t have handed the bottle to my husband to check before tossing it in the bag i’m a little upset that we were in that position in the first place but then i suppose that’s why you don’t accept any prescription meds from people  

i can only imagine what would have transpired if probation had happened to stop by at that moment both of us blissfully unaware that we had a full bottle of liquid drugs just sitting in a bag on our counter there’s not an explanation for that that a probation officer would believe something tells me that “it’s not mine i don’t know why that’s here” is something they hear a lot to top it off my stepdad is a criminal attorney and likely would have been our first phone call from jail “hey dad i’m calling from jail it turns out that cold medicine we brought home happened to be a bottle of opiates” 

i absolutely appreciate the irony that i would end up with accidental free drugs during a period of sobriety rather than the years and years i was using and would have actually been grateful for them that’s amusing to me considering the odds 

just thought i would share this delightful thanksgiving story i mean how often do you accidentally leave thanksgiving with a surprise bottle of lean right 

so lesson learned it’s better to have a chest cold than to make a stupid decision of accepting someone else’s prescriptions out of desperation to feel better 

tldr husband and i have had a bad cold for weeks my stepdad tried to help and gave us antibiotics and a bottle of cough syrup that he didn’t know has opiates in it and we didn’t realize we had it until we were home we dumped out the bottle

11.89138,-8.861868,Addicted,"something i wrote that helped me make sense of some stuff i was going through i hope it helps someone

my name is jerry and i am an addict 


addiction in your early 20’s can take on a different meaning than most understand no matter what your story is or how you got there most of us figured out we were addicts when the consequences of our shitty decisions became too much to handle the first time i ever sought help i did not remember the previous 14 hours and i really had no desire to remember the next 14 hours i had dedicated the year before that to amy winehouseing my way into the ground as hard and as fun as i could possibly afford in cocaine i hated myself i never felt loved thanks to a shitty upbringing and it took a girl breaking up with my toxic ass to finally accept that i would not make it to my 21st birthday i was hell bent on having as much fun as i possibly could before i left my legacy of two beautifully slit wrists in a bathtub and a suicide note that said “sorry for the mess love you guys” 


the gasoline on my proverbial self destructive fire was the party culture i was surrounded by i had access to every drug i could ever want with the send of a text message i had a bull shit job that paid for my rent and my habit and i could even get fucked up there too my life grew around my addiction and as the time ticked towards my 21st birthday a violentnumbness categorized my daily life 


i was surrounded by chaos and the drugs made me love it violent numbness becomes a harsh reality for addicts the more you do drugs the more your life falls apart the more your life falls apart the more you do drugs it becomes less about getting high to numb the pain of hating yourself and more about surrendering to the lifestyle you created because this is the reality you fucking deserve when you fuck up your life so bad that you think there is no way out other than the sweet release into eternal damnation because if there is a hell your spot is already heating up you become addicted to making sure your life reflects what you deserve you are so consumed with hating yourself that things that used to make you happy like going outside or exercising things that bring you joy are merely small distractions from the the fate you have assigned yourself you learn to love your addiction as it learns to “love” you why would we need to love ourselves or seek the validation of an actual human being when drugs have all the benefits and so much less of the mess although clearly misguided drugs gave us the power and validation love never could for once in my life i felt supported in my goals of self destruction

august 23rd 2017 will be two years since i last did drugs i would tell you why i got sober but it does not matter whatever your reason whatever your why whatever your how we will always be addicts sober or not no matter how far i ran from my problems the one thing that remained was addiction addiction has unwillingly beaten some of the hardest life lessons i have learned to date into my soul and molded me into who i am today i am proud of who i am as i am sure many of you who have conquered some kind of addiction are feeling pride however does not always mean that we love ourselves my rehabilitation process taught me ways to cope with being an addict in a college environment which is great and i have been sober since that being said for myself and many addicts that i have spoken to our former lives instill still have a way of coming back to haunt us we know we can’t use illicit substances to get high anymore so addiction can take on many forms for me love became my addiction

i love women i love their hair their smell the feeling of a woman’s body against my own i love feeling something gentle when i have been so clearly not gentle with myself over the previous years i love their ability to make me feel loved the times i feel most loved are when a woman makes me feel loved and when that disappears so does my ability to love myself i love the chase i know how that sounds but i finally feel some control returning back into my life when i can charm a woman not to sleep with me but to want to be with me i am no different than any other man sorry for the harsh reality ladies but love takes on a different sense when you are an addict


women have this uncanny innate nurturing sense about them and it is wasted on the wicked i have been around the block a few times and i can tell you every female i have met worth spending the rest of my life with could smell a broken soul just by looking at your instagram profile women can sense it like a dog can sense a rainstorm coming some run the fuck away but others will stick around because they believe that if they give themselves some part of the love that you lack they might be able to fix you into the person you are unable to see the more you tell them they will never find this person in you the harder they try and as time goes on you think to yourself “holy shit she’s right” the moment you realize she is right you can feel the sweet addiction pull you back down to the reality you have created for yourself through years of violent numbness you don’t deserve her or the version of yourself that she is making you painfully aware of that is not dead anymore you killed that guy a long time ago you have no desire to be with this woman because she loves a part of you that no longer exists when in actuality you are just too afraid to be that guy again so you push her away and cling on to the pain of hating yourself because that is all you have ever known you can’t forgive yourself for the piece of shit that you once were because it would mean loving yourself and you don’t have a fucking clue what that means anymore this is the first type of women addicts attract

the wallowing succumbs to our instincts and like a dog with short term memory loss we trudge on looking for a leg to hump and a pat on the head the second type of woman an addict will attract is essentially the human personification of cocaine she’s beautiful dark and seems like a twisted short term fix to clearly a long term problem everything about her will seem perfect to you and if you two wind up knocking boots it is a high better than any drug i have ever taken the essence of her perfection will ironically be her fatal flaw which is the fact that she could give less of a fuck about you or your dark and twisted past she has no desire to fix you date you or even show a remote semblance of love in any facet she is your drug she will appear as your means to an end you finally found the perfect girl who fits into like a puzzle piece insert more cliches here sure she is pretty and interesting and probably has some demons of her own but the true attraction of this girl lies in the fact that she could give a fuck about you to anyone else this is just a reality of college hookup culture to an addict this girl hates you like you deserve to be hated and you should ride it out until she just stops returning your texts this girl does not love me and the other ones were crazy for loving me so i must be unlovable 


the moral of the story is to anyone who has or is currently struggling with addiction take it from a total stranger who has made a lot of fucked up mistakes in his time you do not deserve what you are putting yourself through if you are going to be addicted to anything be addicted to happiness rather than the absence of it nothing you did in the past is worth destroying the future for and i hope this helps make sense of something for someone

4.8843207,-12.447785,Addiction-prone,"when i decided for my life that i was going to get clean i held up such high expectations on how my new life would play out at first it was actually so easy to get off drugs and stay off my mindset was in a great positive no more drugs place and besides the withdrawals i was powering threw in getting clean

months went by and the dust had settled in my life depression started forcing its way in it was absolutely horrible and the places it took me too were soul crushing hadn’t i been threw enough on top of reliving traumatising memories and feeling isolated within my own mind dropping out of uni my mind was utter chaos

threw that i still kept of the stuff joined a church got my licence and re enrolled into university depression lifted and threw me into a manic episode which i recently was diagnosed with id been to mental health clinics before but i guess they never picked it up because i was under the influence honestly being manic was the best and worst thing that could have happened i got to feel a state of extreme mental elevation and energy levels it felt like i was back to how i am supposed to be just with out drugs which was even better because i had more money for other things i felt like i was finally out of this prison i was swallowed up by i could think about new big things and bad memories and sadness were completely bard from my thoughts i couldn’t think and be saddened by anything
i thought my brain had finally healed from all the trauma and the drugs and that my mind had found me again only who i consider me as was the me on drugs and it was for 7 years

anyway once i crashed and realised it was all mania and it isnt how i was going to feel for the rest of my life all i could think about was drugs i wanted so badly to get back on it because i knew what i was missing in my life and it was me

i think about drugs all the time what i would do when i was on it what music i would listen too what adventures i would have and how busy and full filled i would feel chemically deluded 
i’ve even tried educing a manic episode just so i can get that feeling back
it’s like intense how much i miss and need drugs  i feel nothing with out some kind of chemical overload now  
what keeps me from going back is my memories

sorry for the length if anyone reads this things get built up and there isn’t anyone i can talk to who could understand the life of being an addict who is sober

8.177226,0.9402571,NA,"weve been together almost 7 years ive believed he was the one since our third date so much has happened in our time together hes the only dad my 8 year old son knows he and i have a gorgeous tyrant of a 2 year old daughter

two months ago he tore me limb from limb when he told me he was going to care for his suicidal mother but instead went on a 2 week irelandlondon vacation with his ex he lied the whole time he was there about where he was til i found the itineraries then he lied about being with his ex til i found photos then he told me he was in a rehab in london but he was just dosing at a methadone clinic there then he finally admitted to doing heroin for the last year when he finally came home he told me where to find his stash to be very honest i thought he was trying to hide the fact that he was a disgusting cheating bastard by distracting me with the heroin claim in any case for the 3 days after he returned home he was a different man obv he had a conscience he could talk to me he was human all things sorely lacking for the last 3 years since we moved to vegas

it didnt last i found text messages where he told a friend i stole 900 from him while he was out of country found texts where he made fun of me for my admittedly vengeful and insane reaction to finding out he was out of the country found texts of him scoring heroin and pills

found actual heroin in his toolbox on the 5th took it with me when he discovered its absence he began ranting and raving about how i owed him money now

writing this out makes it all sound like pure insanity

anyway ive been back and forth since he returned alternating between what the fuck am i still doing here and omg pls dont leave me its pathetic while i vowed to do anything to save us he just nodded impatiently and agreed with anything i said then did nothing

he denies everything his first impulse is to lie doesnt matter if it pertains to drugs or weather he will always lie even if i am standing before him with his foils and melted straws in one hand and a glass dick in the other he will swear up and down that he is quitting this is what quitting looks like he tells me he loves me more than anything tells me he cant live without me then lies to me about his whereabouts

last night he promised to come to bed at midnight at 130 he was still playing on his computer he went to the bathroom i ran to the garage found a folded foil resting in a cloth in his toolbox6 of course he was furious thats so old its been there forever

told him to get out he argued til 4am then gave up and left came back today told me i never supported him that when i found his drugs i should have hugged him instead of being angry for a solid 3 weeks he flinched away from my touch because quitting makes me antsy then discovered he was doing pills all along he told me he never said that

the denial drives me up the wall ive doubted my own sanity how could he make such absurd claims with such conviction maybe i was wrong

no i went to my first naranon on tuesday cried through every reading got every free pamphlet cried through those and then felt empowered i stopped fearing his family woulf hate and blame me for his addiction if i left if they hate me so what i know the kind of woman i have been i have no doubt that i have been good

he is finally gone i dont have a vehicle but i have a gorgeous bianchi bike and my son has a decent huffy we can get him to school my daughter has a baby seat on my bike on the bar we made it to school and work on time today

were gonna be okay thankfully my entire world is not this man i have a career and a business i built from the ground up ive been offered a new opportunity for growth in a different field on a hobby level but still

for the first time in months i dont feel sad and useless and lost i feel empowered strong and capable

i hate that the sweetest kindest most loyal man i ever met turned out to be a lying cheating scumbag i hate that i spent so long trying to somehow reverse his addiction i hate that i was a cliche

but i dont hate the lesson as painful as it was because i grew from it i believe that everything happens for a reason it is our responsibility to discover the lesson behind it

4.1446204,-12.269086,NA,"so ive been doing a lot of soulsearching introspection and research lately about addiction i realize that i even once i stop drinking i am still an addict and just keep trying to fill this void and feeling of emptiness with other fixes  food porn social media youtube videos basically anything to distract me and keep me from the feeling of empty despair or discomfort it seems like psychological addictions are a desperate attempt to avoid the feeling of discomfort

my initial plan for getting over my addictions was to basically try and fill my life up with as many meaningful things as possible  better career new hobbies finding a significant other meeting new people and basically more positive things to fill up that emptiness inside my life over the past few years has been extremely unfulfilling and i feel a deep sense of lack of purpose and social connection i just graduated college and at a point in my life where i can pretty much choose my path and set up a new life for myself which is exciting but also kind of overwhelming because im having a tough time deciding what to do next

i guess my question is  do you think that filling your life up with an abundance of better activities people purpose etc is the solution to recovery or do you feel that the need to avoid discomfort and fill the void is the issue i almost feel like i currently need to avoid discomfort and feeling empty and that is the root of the problem

i would love to be situationally independent rather than just create the best situation for me to live in anyone have any experience with this i realize that isolating oneself too much and forcing yourself to feel empty for awhile might not be the best thing to do for the long run but im just afraid that ill always be chasing some type of dragon that might not be real"

4.803905,-3.0825748,NA,"hello

about 10 months ago the worst thing that ever happened to me occurred i lost my mother to her addiction of what we thought at the time was just alcohol but was later revealed that she was abusing painkillers and other substances as well 

before her addiction she was a wonderful mother loving supportive and what i thought at the time was the best damn mom in the world in her final years she was angry spiteful and cruel at times i didnt recognize the women i was looking at 

my mother was unable to win her battle with addiction hell she just barely go to the point where she admitted to us she had a problem a month later she was in the hospital for liver failure two weeks after that she was dead she was 47 

she had been in the hospital 3 times before the last and each time the doctor warned her not to drink she would hand wave it away and say the doctors didnt know what they were talking about she died in agony and we all had to watch while her body was slowly poisoned by toxins her body could no longer cleanse 

my mothers addiction has tainted and corrupted her very memory for my family and me it is so hard to think of her before her addiction took hold i am so angry at her and sometimes hate her for putting her family through that all my most recent memories were of here in despair anger and regret the trauma of watching her slowly kill herself will be with me for the rest of my days 

i share this terrible story in hopes that it may save someone someday it is literally the only good thing that could possibly come from these events please know that if you are fighting you are doing the right thing keep going dont give up for those who may be reading and have so far been unwilling to tackle the problem of addiction please find the strength to do so whatever the cost of the battle it is much less then dying slow in a shitty hospital bed while all your loved ones look on in helplessness and have to bare witness to your decay and the lifelong trauma that goes with it 

tldr
my mother died from her addiction please dont follow her path get help and overcome your addiction by any means necessary if not for youthen for your loved ones  "

i leave behind a legacy tainted

a picture for fools my soul hath painted

sorrow and destitution 

are they not my lone companion

seared into the minds of all who lay eyes upon me

my heart beats as that of a funeral drum

for is this not what it was destined 

fool 

tis but the only cry of my soul 

all humanity imparted by god hath died in me 

a song of sorrow doth my eyes sing with but a passing glance

look not upon me for i am but a shadow 

heard i am not for i have no voice with which to speak

seek not my path for it is wrought with the screams of the unclean and the cries of the sinful

tortured is my mind 

surely the wrathful hand of god hath smote my face

every minute of my life pushes me further to the assuredness of my death 

ask me not how or why this has befallen me for i have no answer

surely death himself hath made my demise of a slow and painful nature

take care little one not to follow in my footsteps for i am nothing 

the wicked fangs pump the poison into my veins

i feel the venom course through my body

sealed is my fate 

the funeral procession is coming

my heart beats slower

my eyes grow tired

and in an instant i am nothing

for i was never here 

i was never alive

i was never seen

i was never heard 

and for this i am forgotten 

culpa mea est

the blame is mine

the above picture i took in early 2016 i was at the peak of my addiction to prescription opiates mainly codeine and dihydrocodeine but often whatever i could get my hands on on more than one occasion i took 28 tablets at a time twenty eight 

before the picture i had drank a full bottle of codeine linctus and taken a handful of pills as you can see i got hit fucking hard by the histamines and im pretty out of it i actually had to go to work upon arriving i was sent home immediately and sacked a few weeks later there was a moment maybe 2 months after that picture was taken where i found myself being offered heroin i had it right there in front of me i was going to take it and i just ran i ran from the flat i was in and didnt contact that group of friends for a while come to think of it we havent really spoke at all since

currently i am in a bit of a tough spot dropping out of university im at a crossroads there is immediate pressure to find a job and soon a place to live since getting over the worst of my pill addiction i have gained over 60lbs of weight also and i was already fat before 

i suppose the purpose of this post is to remind myself that despite not being where i want to be in life right now ive come so far i wont go into detail about the depression and things that happened that lead to my addiction but i have moved on from alot of that in recent months i have not taken opiates since october last year and that was a brief relapse before i flushed the rest down the toilet 

my next addiction to overcome is food ive got a fitbit and a gym membership which i hope can give me some extra motivation for the long road ahead of me i have around 100lbs to lose to be at a healthy weight however finding that photo made me really think about how much worse life could be

hi guys

i don’t usually do this kind of thing but i feel compelled to share that it’s been exactly one year from today that i’ve been free of xanax it was the most difficult experience i’ve ever had to deal with and i’ve battled heroin addiction at a young age yet i found this much harder

i know how scary it is to think of a reality without benzos and the overwhelming fear of doing anything without it the bouts of depression and anxiety when you realize that you’ve built a tolerance and physical dependence from taking it daily then needing to take more just to minimize the rebound anxiety together with the constant questions of “how do you cope with generalized anxiety without it social anxiety how can i do anything without a benzo” eventually i was taking enough to knock me out until 1200 pm the next day without hearing multiple alarm clocks 

a year ago today i suffered a nervous breakdown from abusing benzos and amphetamines in order to keep up with my fast paced and abusive job which i eventually quit and checked myself into an outpatient program to get off the benzos once i tapered off xanax i thought i was losing my mind once i tapered off klonopin forget about it i couldn’t drive i couldn’t leave my house i was terrified of the world around me i couldn’t picture socializing or dealing with daytoday life without a benzo 

i honestly could not imagine living my life without xanax andor klonopin i can’t even remember a life without it yet today i’m free of all benzos for the first time since 2013 and i can honestly say i’ve never felt better i can feel my emotions i can be vulnerable if i want to i can cry if i want to my relationship with my boyfriend of 6 years and with my family has improved tremendously i now have a new job and i feel more alert focused and motivated to do well i even went back to school to finish getting my bachelor’s and i have even gone out of my way to ask my coworkers how their weekends were this is huge for me i am no longer a prisoner to benzos

i just wanted to share this because i remember wanting to get off benzos but was just so consumed with fear and anxiety because the thoughts of being without it was too great 

so for those of you who are attempting to taper off benzos or have been thinking about getting off of them i just want you to know that these feelings are 100 normal you are not alone and there is hope if i can get off of them so can you

hey so 

thanks to people like you ladies and gentlemen i am 10 years clean and sober today

for those curious about how this was done and those who are new ill explain as follows

i had about 3 attempts in aa and na mainly just attending meetings and stuff but that alone didnt work

it wasnt until i got tired of relapsing and got super desperate that i got a good sponsor and went through the clear cut directions showing how we recovered pg 29 in the book alcoholics anonymous that everything changed for me and i started to experience a recovery that was really enjoyable with happiness and other cool stuff

the main thing today that keeps me sober is continuing to work the steps and help others to work the steps through sponsorship

even so there have been times when fully entrenched in the program that i have had to get outside help including counselling because aa does not fix everything 

but basically i was told at the beginning that misery is optional and that there can be an awesome fun  fulfilling life without drugs and alcohol 

i love being sober 

thanks again everybody and keep up the good work

im not sure my sobriety date so i just consider it march 2016 as that was the month ive been battling with opiates since i was 15 and this is by far my longest clean period ive never felt this stable since starting opiates over time i have taken a deeper look at my relapses and what happened beforehand that lead to me spiralling out of control then the next step was to quash the chance of it happening before it grew unmanagable the biggest thing for me was a clear pattern of stopping going to meetings then stopping therapy as i slowly stopped going i slowly became more and more inclined to use id think it had been long enough so i could go out on my own but recovery is a process and i was nowhere near ready to stop going meetings and counseling are a huge support system sometimes the subject of the groups doesnt matter but the fact that youre going to a place for several hours with likeminded people focused on the same goal of sobriety as you really keeps you structured and successful just wanted to share bc im super proud of myself and i am ready for a lifetime of sobriety i hope you are all too anyone is welcome to pm me if they need any help love yall"

my sobriety date is 7991 i have not been very active on these subs lately because of a crazy schedule haven’t been to many meetings either and just wanted to check in and share some things to keep me focused 

i was 28 when i got sober after a 14 year drinking career 10 of those years as a daily drinker the last 5 mostly in isolation i hated everything about who i was and the way i was living my life but didnt know how to change it i came out of a blackout a common occurrence for me in my apartment with the yellow pages open to treatment centers i called an 800 i don’t remember what i said but i’ll never forget what the lady on the other end said “based on what you’ve described in another 30 days you’re either going to be dead or you will have killed someone” that was my moment of clarity those words rang true to my core i could see that train coming right at me 

i got into treatment and learned that it’s the first drink i have to avoid my experience tracks perfectly with the disease model of alcoholism a mental obsession to start drinking coupled with an allergic reaction that makes it impossible to stop drinking the thought of not taking the first drink had never occurred to me 

relapse is not part of my story i think it’s because the above experiences seared into my brain that drink  death my brain does that quickly now even with a little “oh wouldn’t a glass of chardonnay my drink of choice be nice with this dinner” i know intimately how people struggle with relapse and am forever grateful that i’ve managed to avoid that 

i’ve been pretty active in aa the entire time but haven’t done it perfectly years 811 i was mostly absent until i realized i was trying to justify why it would be ok to start smoking weed again i knew where that would lead and got myself back to meetings after a week of daily meetings my crazy and negative thinking had completely turned around it’s still amazing to me how that works for me if i’m not checking in with other recovering alcoholics i’m not hearing what i need to hear 

i’ve had an amazing life so far some of it horrible lots of it fantastic i’ve learned to be grateful for all of it one of the most important lessons i’ve had in sobriety is the concept of relativity an opposite has to exist for me to appreciate anything if i was happy all the time i wouldn’t know it grief is evidence that i love setbacks are evidence of prior success and i can do it again and i’ve had all of that have buried both parents lost jobs long periods of unemployment a couple of times changing careers all things in storage living out of friends guest rooms for 2 years this was years 1012 of sobriety a confused straight marriage a mostly successful gay relationship that ended tragically with me finding him dead in bed from an overdose and drinking never occurred to me during any of that because i know today it doesn’t solve anything only makes everything worse 

my life today is approaching fairy tale status three years into a highly successful relationship an amazing job that pays very well financially secure in a way i’ve never been lots of travel great friendships and if i picked up a drink today that would all be lost and if i don’t in the back of my mind i know how relativity works this too may pass anyway and if it does i’ll keep going and build again i know today how to transform my life i’ve done it now several times over that’s what i wanted when i came into recovery a transformed life life is 10 what happens and 90 how i respond to it aa set the stage for making that happen and i’ve done a ton of outside work to keep it going 

i still work with a handful of sponsees who seem to want what i have i’m only going to meetings 12x a month now because of a wild work schedule with lots of business travel and also working on a masters degree i chaired a major recovery conference in 2013 and frankly am appreciating the break we’ll see how long it lasts 

what hasn’t changed is my daily reflection that i’m an alcoholic who can’t drink today and every day i need to do something that keeps me balanced and focused some reading a little meditation get to the gym eat right stay in touch with close friends – alcoholic or not 

and this morning this was what i needed to do to stay focused thanks for reading

6.265862,-6.1951036,Recovered,"today marks my 3 year anniversary
2 12 years ago during the christmas holidays i found myself alone in my grandmothers house i was strung out on cocaine smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking vodka as if it were water  i was in possession of a gun and in one of the lowest moments of my life i considered that as my only option out

at that point i had been battling depression drug addiction and alcoholism for almost 10 years i would have some short stints of clarity and sober time but it never lasted and the consequences of my actions were becoming more severe 

back to me sitting in my grandmothers bathtub holding a bottle of vodka in one hand and a gun in the other i just couldn’t imagine my life getting any better  thankfully and miraculously my 2 yr old cat came around the corner and just started meowing and he just kept meowing until i got up and went over to pet him he sat on my lap and wouldn’t get up i wound up passing out with my back against the wall and my cat on my lap 

6 months later i finally hit a legal consequence that jolted me enough to consider seeking help it took what it took to get me sitting in a room full of strangers listening to people who had similar stories to mine i told myself i would give this a shot just for 6 months and then i’ll decide if i wanted to keep doing this i wound up detoxing on my buddies couch moved into a house full of sober people and started making meetings

in the beginning i took all the suggestions worked the program to the best of my ability and 3 years later i am so incredibly grateful i didn’t just get my life back i was given a whole new life

this past year has been rough a lot of changes have occurred and i gotta be honest the same enthusiasm i had 3 years ago for the program isn’t at the same level there have been times this past year where i found myself tempted to pick up and drink again what has saved me is my unwavering faith in a power greater than myself no matter how often or far i may stray i concede to my inner most self that i am an alcoholicdrug addict and i will never be able to drinkdrug “normally” and that my god will always show up even in the darkest of times i have to believe those two things or i surely would relapse and i’m not guaranteed a seat back

one mans story
warning wall of text
ok so its now 37 years sober and the first thing anyone asks that is if theyre at all interested is how did you do it

the simple answer would be that i didnt but my higher power did

a less simple answer would be that i was lucky enough to realize i wasnt as smart as i thought i was and so i did what aa in its collective wisdom told me to do

so what was the trigger  to this day i dont honestly know i had been hospitalized twice with dts and was given up for dead or at least neardead once but hey im an alcoholic so i did what alcoholics do when they get out of the hospital  i drank just like i always did about a fifth of cheap vodka a day

then drunk as a skunk on valentines day i jumped into the car with my wife and headed across a snowy wyoming valley to the local detox center  no not some expensive rehab center but a dirty grungy stopoflastresort for the areas drunks

my wife was appalled at the treatment i got enough so that she was launched into a near20year career in the drug and alcohol field i do know they took my shoes away all the while telling me i was free to leave anytime yes sure with 4 of snow on the ground on the side of a mountain  most of my detox stay remains a blur i do know i was sick and miserable and slept a lot

then on the last day  by this time id earned a pair of corduroy slippers  i went to my first aa meeting it was mandatory by the way not much registered except that the key to sobriety was 90 meetings in 90 days i also picked up the nugget that my only job was to stay sober

not being a particularly religious sort i wasnt really into the spiritual aspects of the program but deep inside i knew that something outside of myself was keeping me sober so ok lets call it my higher power whatever it might be

they told me id probably lose my drinking buddies they were right i did but it really wasnt a great loss i had this enduring and unrealistic fear that if i went into a bar someone from aa would see me and id get my ass kicked so i didnt

years go by by the time i had 12 years sober i reasoned that id maybe gotten a little walkingaround sense that could be of use to aa which by then i realized had saved my life so i did all the service jobs and i mean almost all i never became the district chairman but i came close

meetings every week became the norm they kept telling me that maybe i didnt need a meeting every week but it was good insurance that was enough for me

by 30 years it became apparent that id finally found a new way of life and alcohol wasnt a part of it i was firmly convinced that i was like a black man  i could change the status but i was still black only in my case the word isnt black its alcoholic 

where to now at 37 years  i realize i have more years behind me than ahead of me  life is like that im still wedded to the alcoholic community  bought tires today from a guy whose an alcoholic why because unlike most tire salesmen i knew he was honest guess thats a fringe benefit

why am i posting this wall of text 

not for self aggrandizement i assure you maybe its to show newcomers or midtermers that long term sobriety is quite doable even though the first steps seem insanely difficult i figure if just one person decides to challenge me and stay sober for 37 years and one day it will have been a worthwhile exercise especially since one day  today  is all we really have

what have i learned in 45 years of sobriety 

in no particular order 

nothing original  most learned in little rooms with big books – from giants 

i can be my own worst enemy

listen to everyone at least long enough to find out if they have anything worth saying 

it’s not my job to judge or to be judged

we are almost always stronger smarter than me 

i owe my life to others it wasn’t me that got me sober i didn’t know how to

the unexamined life is not worth living – socrates

apologize as quickly as possible

some people seem to be meant to be bad examples try not to be one of them

be harder on yourself than on others then learn to go easy on yourself

you’re not perfect nor are you supposed to be

the worst lies i ever told were to myself 

there is life after drinking a much better one

always say please and thank you

ask

whenever possible do unexpected kindness for someone

before acting on a bright idea ask others 

some of the worst advice i ever got came from me to myself 

i’m worth it

trust nothing you were taught without examination some things you learned were taught are just not true it’s your job to figure those out 

choose your friends wisely  they are the ones who can save you or kill you

learn to forgive others so you can forgive yourself 

for those with a religious bent if you regard yourself as a child of god however you conceive that think it through your god is referred to as some kind of king and your spiritual father  if your ‘father’ is a king what does that make you you need never again bow your head to no one  carlotta mercedes agnes mccambridge – mercy mccambridge – sullins college bristol va 1974"

-8.461845,-25.541298,Recovering,"na is mindblowing
im 50 years fucking old and got hooked on kratom  this after being clean for a year where my last doc was alcohol  lots of shit before that which didnt involve needles  but if you can snort it swallow it or stick it up my ass for better effects i was probably hooked on it  

after realizing i needed a different approach and finally accepting that maybe i dont actually know everything i figured id try na  now i did a few aa meetings when i quick drinking but just could not buy into it  the meetings i went to had too many folks saved by jesus  which honestly i really wish the fuck i could be  but i wasnt and therefore i stopped going  plusi was still in control with aa just a tool that i utilized  

this time i was more spiritually mature having finally making a connection to a god that i believe inone that is in me as well as everything else  plus i no longer wanted to control this quit or my addiction  fucking done with that shit  

i promised myself to do 30 meetings in 30 days in hopes that maybe i would get lucky and find 1 meeting that maybe i could tolerate  this is a great example of how setting expectations just does not work  i expected 29 shitty meetings

my intitial plan was to do both na and aa  the first meeting i went into was an na meeting  where again my expectations was that i was going to find saved people or a bunch of people who could not help themselves  

immediately all expectations were blown out the window  right from the very second i walked through the door  an absolute mindblowing experience  

for the first time in my life i was surrounded by people who knew me  they knew everything about me because i summed up my life in 4 words i am an addict

they knew i thought i was smart as fuck and thought i could figure this out  they knew i over analyzed and thought too deep into things  they knew i was obsessed with fixing the one problem i thought i needed to fix  they knew everything about me 

normally i dont like to socialize  i find it difficult to hold a conversation unless im drunk or high  for sure nobody wants to talk about whats on my mind  except in na  its so damn easy to approach somebody  and better yet they approach me  and genuinely want to get to know me better  

i am on going to my 16th meeting tonight  ive made the effort to visit a different meeting every night so i can see whats going on in my area  every single one of those meetings has been absolutely awesome  with easily half of them being ones that i can call home  

anyway
ive been over at quittingkratom and saw this subreddit group and figured id see whats up  couldnt help myself in declaring my love for na  thank you for listening"

i was in a very bad place as a young adult i went from being a chronic stoner and severe alcoholic as well as a pill user from age 14 to 21 to being a heroin addict from 21 to 25 i hurt my mind and body badly during those years i went 9k in credit card debt at one point i experienced some extremely dark and awful times there were many points when i didnt think i would make it all of us here know the daily living nightmare of having a serious addiction


after inpatient rehab i went into recovery and started taking suboxone i got off suboxone for a short time and went through severe withdrawal without knowing it it was a different withdrawal from heroin instead of physical pain i just mentally couldnt function i started drinking again heavily to cope eventually i chronically smoked crack for about 2 months i never felt like my life was in more danger than during those 2 months crack is a disgusting drug and i regret ever trying it i got back on suboxone and leveled out 


i got into school for xray school was difficult i relapsed a couple times when i tried and failed to quit suboxone all of my schoolmates 12 girls i was the only guy were squeakyclean conservative robots of efficiency who didnt understand at all when i went through hard times i lost all my friends i distanced myself from the friends who used and the friends who didnt use distanced themselves from me school was kind of its own nightmare at times i realized that i couldnt quit suboxone and be successful in school as the withdrawals lasted so long 


i made it through however and finally got a job in another town 2 hours away as a 3rd shift xray tech 3rd shift was hard for me as my mind had taken such a beating that it didnt really deal with sleep deprivation well at 8 months in i started burning out very quickly 


luckily at that time a 2nd shift position opened up it was there that i started finding myself i discovered how to take suboxone appropriately and how to mind my sleep hygiene so that i could function as close to 100 as someone like me can get people actually started liking me and being happy when they saw me i adopted two cats i became one of the best employees in the department my manager started talking me up to her colleagues in the hospital and the mri manager started catching me in the halls trying to convince me to join mri i finally accepted an interview and was hired i now have good income im free of credit card debt im free of drugs and alcohol and most of the time im pretty happy and proud of myself


life is still hard sometimes on the weekends im so exhausted sometimes i just lay in bed the whole day i get brain fog occasionally if i dont sleep properly i have to watch my sleep hygeine like a hawk to make sure im sharp enough to do my job sometimes i just lay in the bottom of the shower for half an hour because its all i really want to do no one at work knows my secret past and sometimes thats hard but its the way it has to be i can be quite introverted my whole immediate family still suffers from addiction problems and disfunctionality


on the good days however which are getting more and more common im extremely proud of how far ive come i paint and draw i play video games im learning a new language  i have my own place my own awesome kingsized bed i have my two adorable loving cats i thank the stars for my mom and dad who never gave up on me along the way im thankful that through a combination of luck and chance i never ended up with any criminal record i still have my body in good shape and my brain is slowly recovering i feel like a real person now 

i think some day i might end up being truly happy its always one step at a time for me ive heard that your 30s is the best time of your life i hope that will be true for me my hard times occur less and less although i know for someone like me the hard times will always be there now and then im planning a trip to iceland to see family this summer and im getting very excited for it things might just turn out alright

your mod team has long term clean time in both programs we are examples that both of these programs work and we have an open mind about the various 12 step programs we havent been in because we have witnessed the steps work and it would appear that different people are attracted to different particular groups working them

this post was prompted by a spate of recent postings that were specifically na vs aa crap we encourage people to be reasonably respectful here period tho and yes that does include being respectful to those folks who are traveling a different path than the 12 steps a lot of people have a lot of emotional investment in their path for good reason we can disagree on approach and not be asshats to each other"

phillip seymour hoffmans relapse and death has rocked my world he also had 20 years sober then he relapsed and it killed him quickly  hes not the only one and then there are those that kill themselves

to be sure there are lots that never relapse and die a sober death

however my friends and i have talked about some of the buggaboos that hit us when sober a long time  heres a short list

1feeling like you cant be honest in a meeting because you are concerned that others with less time will be discouraged if you are having a hard time

2difficulty finding sponsorship

3lack of crisis options


i literally have no shame so i talk in meetings regardless i know that it has scared some people and i will often address that in the talk but if the newbies keep showing up they will see that the program has given me tools to make it through the tools are the same at 1 day as they are at 50 years  dont drink work steps go to meetings work with others


i went without a forma sponsor for a couple of years because there arent many women that have long term sobriety that have time to sponsor in my time i asked them all they all turned me down citing lack of time  at the time i was going through a divorce and i think they were concerned that i would take a lot of support  so i got a therapist and kept in good touch with my friends i spread it around so no one got burned out and i got through it

i have a sponsor now she is older than me but has a about 10 years less sobriety  but what she has is great and good life experience so we have gone back through the steps together its been great


crisis care is harder there have been times that i felt that if someone wasnt watching me i might relapse   i ended up begging my way into codependency outpatient program when i had about 3 years because i was so shaky  the treatment centers wouldnt take me unless i relapsed which seems backwards to me  i wish that there was some place where people could go and get residential support  before they drink or before they kill themselves  if you know of any let me know


lastly  i try to share that sobriety is just that  sobriety it is not a magic ticket to a disney movie  life continues  good bad  always different  it is just a lot easier to navigate sober than dead drunk

back then i never thought i would be able to live happily sober but i also never really knew what it meant to be happy in 4 years i got a new job i got married moved across the country and started to feel alive if i hadnt buckled down and gone to meetings and built my support system i know beyond a shadow of a doubt i would be dead today i wasnt going to make it i was suicidal i was alone i drove drunk and high everyday i had a death wish i was a janitor in my old high school drinking in the closets and puking in sinks at 28 years old i was still hanging out in my old high school granted i was working doing a lot of the same stuff i was doing when i was a student there it was sad 

now i wake up everyday sometimes groggy sometimes cranky but never hung over i still get caught up in some of the small things complain about my job wish i was richer better younger whatever but most of the time i am able to take a minute and step back and really put it into perspective im happy now my life isnt perfect not by a long shot but its manageable everyday is a new day and i think thats the most important thing i was able to learn

on september 9th 2004 i was at the end of my rope i was using and drinking constantly i wasnt going back to college i had lost most of my friends because of my addiction and self centeredness and i decided to kill myself i had attempted many times before that was why i had been kicked out of college for drinking in the dorms and trying to kill myself often 

that day technically sept 8th i had been drinking and using all day i got into a fight with the boy i was seeing read sleeping with because he was going to stay with his girlfriend because as he said why would i date you youre crazy i got into a fight with my parents because i was drinking and i told them i knew theyd be happier if i wasnt in their lives so i went up to my bedroom on the 3rd floor looked out my window and thought ok either go to bed and be a pussy or jump out this window and hopefully you die

i didnt die obviously but i did break my back and as i lay in the grass looking up at the sky bawling i said god just do something with me i cant even kill myself im such a failure i got up walked into my house fought with my parents more then passed out when i woke up i was throwing up blood so they took me to the hospital where the xrays showed i had burst a vertebrae i had to have invasive surgery where they put rods in my spine and took bone marrow from my hip i had to learn how to walk again and it was in the hospital that i told my mom i needed help i told her if i drank or used again i would in fact kill myself and i needed rehab

about 20 years ago a good friend of mine stabbed me with a pencil i was reaching for something on his desk and he went to swat my hand away not realizing he was holding a pencil the tip snapped off in my finger i had to go to the hospital to get it removed my friend was absolutely sick over it — even at that age he always had a real soft heart when i got it removed the doctor told me “you’ll be the first of your friends to have a tattoo”

i lost touch with the guy over the years as our lives unfolded but i’ve always had this mark to remember him by a few years ago i was at a meeting in jersey city and i swear it there he was i wasn’t a hundred percent sure so i quietly tried to stare at him and make the confirmation

a few minutes later after i’d shared he made the connection his face lit up with disbelief he raised his hand with an inquisitive look and pointed at his finger as if to say “really that you man” i raised graphite marked finger and his face beamed

after the meeting we hugged and caught up he’d been through the wringer with addiction — we both had but we were both doing better putting the pieces back together so much more grateful for what we had on that day because we knew neither of us deserved it since we’ve run into each other quite a bit we ran in the same circles and it was a good place to be

he died on oct 11 this fucking disease got him a week ago he was posting goofy pictures on facebook from work because he had a good job now there are pictures scattered across his recent history with friends with his daughter his girlfriend and his family he got all of that back in reality he deserved all of it because he worked to get it back and now he’s gone

20 years ago i became the first kid in my school to get a tattoo for two decades it meant little to me now it might be the most significant tattoo i have now it reminds me that all i have is today and if i let my guard down or think “i’ve got this” for one damn second it could all be gone i’ll miss you buddy but thank you"

hi

i used to be a very heavy heroin user i kicked it with suboxone and eventually became completely clean ive been clean about a year and a half 

if you could use some advice have a question or just want to talk to someone that knows what youre going through drop me a line

in the recovery process for opiates your mind plays a lot of tricks on you you start to question everything youve ever thought was true after the initial 35 days of intense withdrawal with all the shitting vomiting and leg pain you get to the mental withdrawals that are the worst part for about another 8 weeks you still cant sleep regularly and you have no energy or motivation you cant remember what normal the way you were before the dope felt like so you dont know what are symptoms and what is just normal life at that point its good to talk to someone thats been there 

suboxone was less hard to kick than everyone says i think a lot of the symptoms people talk about from kicking the suboxone are mental you do feel some stomach pain and lack of motivation for about 8 weeks but its much more manageable than heroin withdrawal that is if you tapered correctly i had a huge tolerance for h when i used i took large doses however when i was prescribed two 8mg suboxone strips per day i only kept to that regimen for the first week then i cut the dose in half everyday until i got to 18th of a strip or 1 mg i didnt feel any withdrawal symptoms from dropping to that dose i think with subs taking more just to keep from feeling the withdrawals arent necessary more can put a little more spring in your step for the first week or so but you dont need them after a couple years on 1 mg i lowered it to a half mg and a week later to 25 mg then i went to 25 mg every other day and finally stopped

at any rate im here to help"

we all have habits deeply ingrained behaviors that are hard to change a habit is specifically defined as “a settled or regular tendency or practice especially one that is hard to give up but what makes a habit turn into an addiction

one of the key indications that a habit is turning into an addiction is the observation of increasingly negatively consequences a bad habit can have some negative consequences—such as weight gain if you drink too many sodas or regular tiredness up if you consistently stay up too late watching television

while these sorts of consequences are unpleasant they are certainly not life altering unlike bad habits the consequences of addictions are often severe resulting in serious legal financial or relationship issues an addict may find ways to mitigate consequences at least for a while but they will be unable to stop using this continued abuse of drugs or alcohol even in the presence of serious negative consequences is the hallmark of addiction

2 swim doesnt have a spare year or two he needs stimulants to be productive because he overused for an extended period of time never allowing his thinker to recover

hey guys so i made a throwaway account for this obviously so i can explain the situation a bit 
sunday morning i hung out with a buddy who came over to smoke the last bit of weed that i had with me we chilled and after a while he said he had to go run some errands but that hed get us some more and come back and smoke later 
that afternoon he comes back and says he didnt bring the weed because he couldnt get some but that he got something else 
at this point id like to point out that the weed we had smoked earlier was really good also it doesnt take much to get me high because i was still definitely stoned otherwise i know i wouldve never agreed to do what i was about to do 
he says he brought amphetamines and me being a pretty sheltered person from drugs again aside from weed for some reason i assumed he was talking about pills nope he was talking about dope 
he put it in the bowl and heated it up and all that jazz and we smoked from it now im not going to lie and say it was bad it was the craziest rush ive ever had probably the horniest ive ever been in my life i took several hits from it because i remember asking him all the time after wed put it down can we smoke more 
that was sunday night monday went by like a breeze most of the day i just stayed at home laying in my bed i dont even know how i passed the time he came back to my apartment that night and he didnt have the pipe with him so he crushed a little bit of it and used part of a broken glass pipe heated it up and snorted it i tried but only got a little bit after two attempts it burnt my nose and i didnt like it it was a different high because i didnt feel the crazy rush mostly i was just tired so i slept 
fast forward to today wednesday and im still feeling weird i feel anxious nervous idk i dont feel like myself ive been sleeping and eating though im definitely scared because ive been reading a lot about how people get hooked from the first time they try this thing but honestly i dont ever want to be near that when is this feeling going to go away though its been 2 days basically since i smoked sunday night how long will it take to start feeling like myself again honestly scared here  sorry

at one point i found a boyfriend with whom and my mother we moved to another much bigger city i started high school there and got all as i loved studying when i turned 18 me and my boyfriend split up and just some months after that i found another guy who was 35 years old and we started dating and soon i moved to his apartment i finished high school and after that i got severely depressed again and started to go to a psychiatrist years went on i wasnt in school i tried to kill myself with my antidepressants several times my partner was always there for me and my mother who didnt drink nearly as much and she had gotten her life together was also i started to drink way too much and then at some point i decided to go to a kind of rehab i stopped drinking and found the joy of life again for a little while i applied to university and got to in to study my dream subject i was sober for years and my studies went almost too well however i still wasnt healthy enough to study full time so luckily i got to study as slow as i wantedi had been diagnosed as having severe depression dependent personality and later after i tried suicide again about 8 years ago my doctor diagnosed also anxiety disorder and ptsd and prescribed me benzos for my anxiety i started using benzos everyday at evenings to take the stress and anxieties away and im still using them even though  managed to decrease the amount by 13 i was also in therapy for five years but im not writing about the benzos


my biggest problem now is sleeping med called zopiclone brand names zimovane and imovane i started using them also around 2010 and i also used zolpidem a little i got these amazing highs from these meds it felt like my life has a purpose that my depression that has been with me for so long that i can remember was vanished everything was so good and i was good now i still get zopiclone imovane every 30 days im supposed to use it 1 per night i still study in fact i got my ba last year which was huge for me and i got an a from my thesis my studies are going super well i get good grades mostly but im still able to study on my own pace so i study kinda slow i try to get better all the time though it doesnt always go as planned i have also been cutting myself since i was a teen but not for a long time expect last autumn i did it again i am in therapy at the moment with another therapist

if this question is not appropriatewelcome in this subreddit please feel free to delete but since this is addiction prevention educationrelated i figured there may be a subject matter expert here who knows 

looking for this antidrug or drunk driving documentary video that i saw in 6th or 7th grade health class in 1989 or 1990 in maryland usa judging by the music and fashion that people were wearing in the video it had probably been produced in the earlytomid 1980s however as everything seemed really out of date to me at the time

one segment interviewed a teenage boy who i think had been responsible for a drunkdriving crash that killed or injured someone he looked a little on the dorky side and was wearing glasses  possibly aviators the only thing i remember him saying something like we had a few beers we had a few bombers or it might have been rompers or uppers or poppers this is the part that has nagged me for the past 30 years

addiction can be an ongoing struggle for many people even after they complete an intensive treatment program periodic relapses are not uncommon relapseprevention planning is crucial then for maintaining longterm sobriety in its simplest terms relapse occurs when an individual abstained from using drugs for any period of time and then use again this use may be a brief onetime lapse in abstinence which is often called a slip or it may be a binge that involves using drugs in large amounts or repeatedly in either situation relapse does not mean an individual cannot get back on the road to recovery however it may indicate that underlying issues are not being managed effectively or that an individual could benefit from recommitting themselves to their sobriety in this training participants will learn the importance of relapse prevention related to treatment and recovery and to recognize the common components of relapse process

7.27377,-1.0852747,Addiction-prone,"what to do when drugs is the best thing in life
throwaway account because of obvious reasons

short bio smoked hash more or less daily from about 15 to 25 psychedelics occasionally heavy use of speed pills and alcohol from 20 to 25 stopped using all drugs cold turkey around 25 because i was just sick of being fucked up all the time also had something of a nervous breakdown due to life circumstances and too much speed now 37 years old 2 kids wife house in the suburbs decent blue collar job 

this is the problem nothing beats drugs i have to say this after 37 years on this fucking planet ive had my fair share of hot girlfriends and great sex before i settled down sex is certainly nice but afterwards i feel stupid and low money yeah nice enought but things doesnt make me happy traveling is the closest thing to drugs i like being in foreign environments but mostly because its a new environment to get high in doing acid at a beach in asia is better than doing acid in your bedroom so what else kids i love my kids to death but life with kids is mostly a drag picking up toys and making dinner and cleaning and trying to juggle work with kids stress 

the only thing in the world that ive found that delivers every time or close to every time is drugs sad but true its not that im addicted as i wrote earlier i quit cold turkey after about 10 years of daily use and didnt have much of a problem doing so  when i wanted to quit smoking cigarettes i quit no biggie i guess im blessed with a non addictive personality which is great from about 25 to 35 i was clean smoked weed a few times but not much else

now 37 kids and wife started using dissos which i highly enjoy if you would  ask me what was the greatest time in my life i could lie and say it was when my kids were born but its not my best times when i was on ecstasy on some techno party in the forest or when im traveling strange realms on ketamine nothing beats it its sad as hell but i dont know what to do about it i mostly stay away from drugs because i have duties but im unhappy when i see that its a sunny day i think man i wish i could take some acid today when ive put the kids to bed i think i wish i could take some k and go to that mechanical wonderworld when i fuck my wife i think this is ok but i wish we would do some e and really get going

im not sure if im venting or what im doing but i would love some input from wiser minds i could certainly continue living my life as i do being sober and halfmiserable or i could embrace drugs and find better living through chemistry certainly there is a price to be paid but yeah i guess im stuck i cant live the drug lifestyle because of my duties to my kids and my wife but at the same time theres nothing id rather be doing am i addicted i guess in a sense i have an addicts mindset but thats only because ive tried drugs and ive tried the normal joys of life and drugs are better

sorry for the rant

edit should clarify that the wife hates drugs shes been okay with me using dissos and dmt a few times but really doesnt like it she thinks that i should just put those things behind me as im now a dad

16.033884,1.8970823,Addicted,"being 30 rules
this is just a chatty shitpost so please feel free to ignore im definitely feeling tender after having a good time friday night

friday night i went out to see sts9 with my husband and a couple of our friends were 3035 and have been around the block enough to know what we like and what our limits are 2 of us took lsd and a small amount of mdma i had a fat borax combo 5mapb 6apdb a bit of 4fa bit of 4homet and another friend just had a small amount of mdma we would have had fun sober but it was fun to enhance our evening and make the music a little more sparkly

people watching was interesting saw a few people there who were obviously drug dealers doing business but the crowd was mostly younger folks under 30 who appeared to be manageably high or tripping or rolling 

the whole thing made me appreciate that i havent gotten addicted to anything and i dont engage in shadysad things like selling nitrous balloons after shows or wasting the entire time at a concert running around sellingbuying drugs we had a decent hotel room to stay in and responsibly went home to the hotel after the show after realizing we werent going to meet anyone good running around port chester at 1 am

notably i spoke briefly with a 22 year old guy who was tripping on lsd and told him were an old married couple and he couldnt believe it and said youre married as if being married is something that only old decrepit people can do

festivals are fun and all but theres something really special about going to a concert or event for a few hours and knowing your limits and sleeping in a bed in a hotel room p"

22.118826,5.8319626,Addicted,"mine and my husbands 4th dance with mdma
holy shit you guys we looked at mdma all wrong we saw it and kinda treated it as a recreational drug with therapeutic properties last night taught us that it is a therapeutic drug with recreational euphoric properties

90mg for me 120 for him we took it after a boatload of vitamins about two hours after a hefty meal we drank a small glass of grapefruit juice that morning but thats all we could stomach of that stuff 

despite the food shit started happening within 20 minutes i was coming up pretty hard him not so much we decided to wait it out and see if he just needed patience instead of a booster dose

we headed upstairs to get naked and touch each other all that good stuff as i was rolling pretty good at this point him still catching up almosttoo good i kept getting twinges of anxiety because the sensations were a bit overwhelming at times overstimulation of sorts it definitely floored me 

we decided to give him a 60mg booster dose half up the nose half eaten and while i was measuring it out i suddenly just nope couldnt do it floor it was literally floored me i had him finish measuring and had him eat half and snort the other it was a few more moments before i was able to get up and go back to the bed 

it came in waves of incresing intensity id get floored then id be okay and then floored again and then okay you get the idea at times it almost got panicky in a very familiar way that psychedelics get panicky remember that mdma has psychedelic properties and respect them

i hadnt realized how much anxiety was holding my experience back as soon as he told me that he was where he wanted to be my anxiety vanished and i was able to more thoroughly enjoy the roll we talked hugged fucked kissed did nitrous balloons god so many balloons so many balloons pretty sure most of our footage is just us huffing balloons lol

another thing to note we set up some cameras in an attempt to capture the magic of the moments i love watching vids of couples rolling so why not record ourselves this becomes ironic later

much time is spent just in each others arms again i am floored and talking is a bit difficult during those floored moments holding each other and being close enjoying the intimacy 

then a tired feeling crept up on me shoot is it over already eh oh well that was kinda intense im over it i was honestly about to write off the experience as somehwat of a flop we went into it with recreation in mind primarily and therapy secondarily still fun and still had the magic but the anxiety from being floored was a bummer plus anxiety about him not being where he wanted to be in the beginning

we had prepared 12mg 2cb doses for us beforehand volumetrically dosed and left out for easy access at this point i didnt even want it i was convinced that the partys over stage had come and the night was largely over i was just happy to be coming down tbh as shit was intense

our vitamins and 2cb alarm went off and i had second thoughtsfuck it ill take the bees why am i such a party pooper it really was just anxiety holding me back the second i got up to change rooms it was revealed to me that i most certainly was not done rolling not at all  set and setting are some shit my guys 

heres where the irony comes into play we head to the bathroom to drink our 2cb shots and ghb doses and puffs on our weed vape and we stayed in that bathroom for four hours on the floor talking about our histories our pasts things we didnt even realize we were hiding from one another it all came out

all those cameras they missed every second of the real magic 

four hours literally four hours just on the bathroom floor mdma brought it all out of us we thought we were close and knew everything about each other before theres so much shit insecurity prevents you from even realizing youre hiding all these walls mdma wrecks those walls and barriers it creates this safe place to just be who you really are and love and accept others for who they really are

that is the fucking magic we went into the experience expecting just some good old recreation with some good talks when the recreational bit didnt go as planned i was uncomfortably high at times he needed a boost there was definitely some anxiety about losing the magic already i wasnt even getting many eye wiggles even though it had been eight months since our last roll when in reality all we needed to do was just roll with it let it do its thing stop fighting the feelings stop trying to force it just roll with it set and setting are so important

the addition of the 2cb and ghb really facilitated what was effectively a 6 hour roll we really nailed it this time the transition was absolutely seamless and the happiness and empathy there seemed less pushy than in the wham recreational omgomgomg rolling phase and instead just so pure

here i had thought that once the main rolling stops the partys over but that is so not true the magic lasts all night if you can roll with it if you can get the set setting and of course some complimentary chems in the mix 

so our fourth dance with this chem a bit of a wonky start and a bit unexpected lesson learned dont expect anything but ultimately its the best experience we have had so far we were completely blown away by just how good therapeutic and magical the night was"

5.6178083,-0.58415735,NA,"visiting amsterdam over 30 heres what we learned
i spent a few days in amsterdam with my wife and we have a few tips for you if youre adults planning to visit that awesome place
most of the guides online are targeted to teenagers and partygoers who dont mind sleeping in filthy hotels and smoking in creepy places but were in our 30s and we expect a certain standard that was harder to find

moving around

there is no free wifi in amsterdam you wont get one at starbucks you wont get one at mcdonalds unless you have a sim card from a local carrier you should prepare your trip to be able to move around while offline
we did it and didnt miss having access to internet when in the city honestly

 download an offline copy of the city on google maps even without signal gps still works and this will be incredibly useful to know where you are and where you are going
 download the amsterdam public transportation app on the appstore it is free its official and it contains all the subway train and tramway maps this is the only app you really need to move around
 skip the free tourist guides on the appstore most are scams that contain no information whatsoever unless you pay extra
 you can go everywhere with the tramway and its very easy to use once you have the map buy a day pass and dont forget to check in when you enter the tramway but also dont forget to check out when you leave the tramway
 if its your first time in amsterdam and youre arriving by plane take a train to centraal and from there youll be able to catch any tramway

tourism

a lot of places are sold out days in advance youll need to get in line for hours to get tickets if you dont book in advance
but if you buy your tickets in advance you skip the line get a choice of the visit time and its almost much cheaper than buying at the location place that get sold out are the anne frank house 5h line stretching up to 2 blocks otherwise and no guaranty to get in the van gogh museum 

you can also check with your hotel as most decent hotels can sell tickets to their clients

if you want a picture with the i amsterdam sign i recommend getting up early and getting there around 7am the light is great and after that its full of kids teenagers and tourist climbing all around it no way to get a decent photo


the legal drug scene

its not just weed that is legal truffles kana and other drugs are also available legally

most coffee shops are very creepy dark dirty smelly and shitty staff that was a big surprise as we visited around 15 coffee shops and couldnt find a single one that was cosy clean and welcoming unless youre into breakingbadstyle drug dens i recommend you take your weed to go and smokevape somewhere else avoid places with children obviously and sit  relax on a bench in front of a canal in a park or at a terrace of a regular cafe it is acceptable and common so dont feel bad about it its europe so everybody smoke everywhere anyway

coffee shops usually target smokers and i have found only one who had a vaporizer and it was very dirty i gave it back as i wasnt going to put my mouth on that filthy piece i was afraid itd ruin the vacation i really dont enjoy joints until i found azarius

if you are like us and dont like to smoke you can buy vaporizers there they have every major vaporizers for decent prices and the staff was awesome very helpful and very knowledgeable i bought a vapcap m there and it made the vacation absolutely awesome you can use weed  hash in there without issue the taste and effects are great highly recommended

do not buy the cleaning product theyll try to sell you tho 30 for a small bottle is ridiculous when you can get a 97 iso bottle for less than 2 at any pharmacy to bring back the vapcap to the us i just dropped it into the iso bottle put the bottle in my luggage and that was it no smell no residues no issues

if youve never taken a truffle before i highly recommend it start with the weaker one mexicana it provides a great body high but will make you antisocial so i highly recommend you take it by yourself without friends around it will prevent you from sleeping for hours after the effects are gone and it will make any food impossible to swallow so plan ahead eat before and enjoy the high in a private setting i took mine before going to the cinema and it was one the greatest experience ive had with drugs and ive tried lsd mdma shrooms and weed in the past it will make you hyper focused and make things more beautiful i still dont know if war for the planet of the apes really was a good movie but in my memories it was the greatest movie ever made

once you have experience the mexicana truffle if you are looking for something stronger i recommend the dragon slayer  vaping some sativa the high was very close to lsd with a complete loss of the notion of time sound distortion vivid colors and a deep relaxation i took it in a park after visiting the van gogh museum near dawn with weed and saw the clouds looking exactly like van gogh paintings the world became a painting moving in slow motion with distorted sounds pretty intense carry a bottle of water with you as youll sweat a lot and get dehydrated extremely fast

dont expect to fuck on truffles you wont be in the mood

food

lets be honest the food sucks and is very expensive compared to the rest of europe they mostly cater to drunk  high people and you can feel it in the service and quality everywhere you go
so either plan a decent budget to go to upscale restaurants or prepare to eat a lot of crappy sandwiches soggy pizzas and low quality pasta

if you want awesome cheap food go to france except paris which is also expensive and mostly crappy like most super touristic places

overall

amsterdam is a beautiful city and we highly recommend spending a few days there it was awesome getting high legally and its a very relaxing city where you can let go of your stress theres plenty of things to do for all tastes its just missing a decent food culture

i cant wait to go back"

vaping dmt with this pen was super easy i tried it last night for the first time put 30 mg of powder directly into the ceramic donut coil tapped the button to melt then took a long slow 810 second draw bam instant trip not sure if it was breakthrough yet but it was close

so for 50 you have everything you need to vape dmt effectively plus enough coils to experiment vaping other things without cross contamination

to clarify the magneto is the newest pen the cap and mouthpiece are magnetic so its very easy to pop on and off during use the evolve plus is similar and supposedly just as good but the cap and mouthpiece are screw on instead on magnetic the magneto can take the evolve plus coils but the cap that comes with the magneto coil does not work on the evolve plus coils there is also the yocan evolve not plus this uses different coils so be sure you are getting the plus coils

i am now a 40 year old with a job wife career etc etc all is good especially considering i was a heroin addict spent 5 years in prison for dealing mdxx and the usual drug fucked up lifestyle from 11 32

i use a little something every 23 weeks on a friday night but nothing major and very responsibily about 3 times a year myself a couple of select friends have a good session its well planned with good product and depending on the 35 who attend we can have up tp 100 years drug using experience between us i should add i only drink alcohol if using a stim it just doesnt interest me

a few days ago the first session of 2017 arrived i was so excited i posted in drugs that morning and vaked420 suggested i report back here the drugs involved were addys coke heroin mdxx wed alochol xanax diazapam and some cuban cigars everything is sourced through connections made through the years it is all top quality and cost price or free a couple of us have been in prisonso friends we had years ago who stayed in the game look after us even though we are now people who are not involved in crime and contribute to our communities

we start with a few drinks and coke about 2pm it is so enjoyable to drink snort and tell old stories and adventures to each other i am sure for other people listening we sound like a bunch of old fogies but to us it brings back smiles laughs and reminds us of why we loved the drug life

next up is the mdxx pil tested positive for mdma and good reports i drop and redose 90 minutes later i love this and spend sometime telling my friends what makes them special and why i love them and why i love my wife so much and how great my mom is etc a few joints of top quality green during this period really helps the love rushes orgasm their way through the body

next its a little diazapam and xanax and then out comes the h smoking h coming down from mdxx is just such a beautiful thing with the benzos eliminating the nausea this goes on until 10 am until i am nodding the most euphoric nod one can imagine

 at this stage we divide a little of everything to ease back to reality over the next few days as well as this a substantial stash is brought away to a stash spot for the next hurrah

it is so important for us that we take what we want and not just take what we have we only get to do this 3 times a year or so but it just gives me such lease of life renewed sense of well being and energy focus connection to the world and positive energy

the aftermath is easy for me plenty of time to relax good prearation for recovering time good healthy food and hydration

i wont lie recovery time after 40 yrs old even for a 2 day sesh can be slow and tough but with some good preparation and proper sourcing you can make it very easy and even enjoyable

i got back into psychedelics to seek that special something that ineffable thing that binds the universe together and i think i have a good handle on that but what bugs me is how unauthentic people are day to day we cant ever say what we truly mean even though we all feel it in my trips ive experienced death and rebirth the far ends of the human experience i touched the hand of the goddess the one true lovemotherhealershamandemonsummoner and slayer she told me its gonna be okay but i still have my battles 

i want people to be honest to air their opinions and have rational debates i live in a house of females and work with a myriad so rational sense is sometimes off the table but authenticity is not hard just be yourself i try me best i hold my patients hand before i put them under i tell them i will take away their pain and i do with iv ketamine and fentanyl infusions and other cocktails my main goals are maximally aggressive care for cure or comfort about about 13 is strictly comfort terminal no chance of meaningful recovery so i see a lot of deaths some sudden and tragic but some so obviously coming and i feel bad no one should have to suffer in the end we have to tools for that  all said im looking into postgrad training in palliative and hospice care to authenticate the dying experience as a wholesome and natural one i dont see why i cant provide both services they are different 

this is getting long but this is the spirit of the sub how do you cope with inauthentic people in your life  how do you deal with the facade of everyday humans buzzing about in their consumption and snapchat and insta and facebook  i think we are the authentic one  it afraid of being real we took the red pill so yes how deep does the rabbit hole go

so my boyfriend had a surprise psychedelic adventure planned for me today ive had it marked on the calendar for weeks now even though all i was told was just be yourself and drop a little acid

anyway it turns out what he was taking me to was an art opening that showcased the work of thomas wilfredurl who was an artist and inventor in the 1920s who made incredibly beautiful art out of light its just very trippy and beautiful and reminded me a lot of visuals ive had on mescaline

it would have been amazing to see 100 sober but while tripping i was just lost in another world lookong at all the various pieces theyre so hypnotizing

my boyfriend doesnt trip but he loved watching it too but was also quite amused by how into it i was getting i was definitely out in psychedelic outerspace at that point id taken 250ug of ald 52 two hours before the museum and i was definitely getting really lost in the images

anyway its one of the nicest dates ive ever been on i thought it was so well thought out and i appreciated how he had it all planned for me

so just wondering what kind of romantic drug dates other folks are having feel free to interpret romance however you like or ones that youd like to do in the future

last year he took me on another drug date where i hippie flipped at a butterfly sanctuary and that was pretty amazing too"

i guess one reason we find ourselves here on reddit is the need to discuss those things that interest us in a safe and sane environment especially where recreational drug use is concerned this may be something that’s hard to do irl the level of mutual trust needed to openly reveal the intimate and illegal details of our drug use is extremely high here that trust is placed in our anonymity i’m wondering if it is possible or wise to seek such trustworthiness irl 

since the folks reading rdrugsover30 are most likely fully integrated into the working world or as in my case retired from it we may no longer belong to a network of drugusing friends as we did “back in the day” so how does one safely connect with likeminded individuals in our little towns and neighborhoods is there a secret handshake wink or teeshirt that would discretely disclose our secret identity as responsible drug users “snap snap grin grin wink wink nudge nudge say no more” or should such disreputable behavior be just kept to ourselves"

this subreddit was publicly announced on feb 15 within two days we got almost 800 subs were hoping to keep the momentum going

first id like to introduce myself

im the founder and currently only mod im a tech professional in my 40s im married and have three young kids i grew up during the just say no era and never was really exposed to anything harder than pot in my late 30s i was introduced to recreational substances like mdma and lsd these substances along with several others have made a huge positive impact in my life there are several subreddits that have helped me get educated about drugs like rdrugs and rdarknetmarkets among others those subs have been invaluable but those are subs that i often use to search for content that i need and then get out what im hoping to build here is a community for adults to discuss not only drugs but also life with an open mind and good will also it doesnt matter if you are experienced with drugs or not as long as youre open minded about their use

due to the nature of this subreddit we should all exercise caution not to reveal too much personal information but i would love to hear about who you are and what you hope to get out of this sub

also if youre interested in the demographics of the sub i would love for you to take out survey its anonymous and very simple interestingly so far we are more than 50 under 30 which is fine im more interested in people who want to build a community rather than any specific age

you dont actually need to be over 30 its like the difference between rsex and rsexover30 ideally youre an adult with your life together folks who use occasionally and are more interested in life than in drugs but happen to also like drugs anyway its brand new it may or may not work out lets see

since this is new i dont know 100 what content should or should not be allowed i will probably delete posts pretty aggressively i am open to ideas though

in an nutshell though its not for the high schoolers asking if its ok to smoke weed everyday its even for the college kids abusing adderall or wondering if its ok to take molly every weekend thats what rdrugs is for this is for folks who have their shit together and are looking to drugs to enhance life not fix it

a few days ago i went to a pretty great piece of art the description reads like this

	skalar is a largescale art installation by christopher bauder and kangding ray which explores the complex impact of light and sound on human perception

i immediately realized that i wouldn’t want to go sober for events like this psychedelics are great however since there are lots of sober people and even children it can also be a challenge so i tend to choose psychedelics with a relatively weaker headspace compared to lsd or magic mushrooms i have tried 4homet allad and 2cb for this purpose of these 2cb is by far the most comfortable and social one in my experience so i decided on 20 mg of 2cb orally

have a look at some impressions of what it was likeurl pretty cool don’t you think

the exhibition takes place in a huge former industrial building with concrete pillars and a very high ceiling it’s kind of gloomy since there’s no light besides the sculpture and the signs to the emergency exit this suited us extremely well since people won’t look at our saucer sized pupils

the sound and lights are extremely well done even a sober friend says she experienced synesthesia it sucked us in and hypnotized us

there are several parts as you can see in the video i didn’t take a picture of all parts some of the best are missing it takes about 40 minutes to complete once and repeats afterwards 

we spent four hours watching it from different places in the gigantic hall after a while we recognized the structure and gave the different parts names like sun ocean thunderstorm and dragon the crowds didn’t bother us in the least we even increased our dose by snorting another 10 mg and added some cannabis from a vaporizer if they hadn’t closed we would have stayed even longer i’m certain

m 18 and 20at the time of these experiences so i went to two ayahusca retreats in peru doing 4 ceremonies through 7 days  so total 8 ceremonies  litterally emptied my bank account to do so both times and it was so worth it after seeing the dmtthe spirit molecule documentary i felt very compelled to the phenomenon of dmt and i made my way to kapitari which is the name of the healing center in peru i went to if you ever want real good shamans and a great community that really makes you feel you are welcome and loved part of the family go there  also mostly adults 30 there

and so well i went there and it was a profound life changing experience and since i am now 21 i would say also this is pretty distant in the past so ill jump really to the learnings that struck me the mostmy conscious mind even tho i know deeper changes even forgotten got carved into my soul

1 contrast between ups and downs difficult and blissful moments is what makes things so much more beautiful and intense  worth living and so let yourself live them fully whatever you judge them to be goodbadetc heres how this came about   

   1 first night of ceremony i felt like i was dying for the first 2 or 3 hours because i was just feeling so harsh physically sweating tons and tons i was advised not to drink too much water and i felt i was gonna dry up and die really until i asked one of the facilitators trip sitters sort of there were 2 if i was gonna die after explaining to him everything sweating ill feeling purging vomit diarrhea and all he suggested i either take more not an option to me at that point or so i felt or drink a bit of water and just let mother ayahuasca do her work after during the most intense and difficult moments of my life reaching the 99937 intolerable hard purge things settled and i started to see everyone that loves me and and whom i loved back flashing by at an insane rate backwards in the chronological order of my life until i was nothing but the essence of myself and at that point i was reborn into my 18 years old body like a baby into pure bliss at that point i reexplored each of my senses astonished by the complexity of each one of them and thought to myself like there must so many things like this infinitely complex around us and we just assume we know already and walk by not paying any attention to an incredible profoundness where you usually assume shallowness i could basicly find everything in anything anywhere anytime similar to a place ive been on my best mushroom trip where i was everywhere and nowhere forever and never simultaneously anywho i bathed in this pure love for hours before falling asleep to the most realizationsfilled and unique dreams

and then inbetween ceremonies in 1st week  arts lady with a painting interpretation quite a learning on myself and harsh truths fruit baths plant baths fun times listening to other peoples experience around me shaman meetings plant eating dancing with naked tribals and more a truly transformative experience

i am 21 today and just recently one of my close friends explained to me how much i had changed after that experience 3 years ago and how thats actually when i started having an impact in his life and so how he noticed me being around him leading to a friendship i am profoundly grateful for when i look back i feel so lucky to be me alive passionate about everything i do and confident in knowing i love what i do and do what i love parkour coachstuntmanmusicianphilosophy and psychology i see so many lost 20 30 and even 40 years old in life that really never took the time to find themselves and theyre quite a large fraction of the population from my experience id say approximatively 405037 and so yea ayahuasca is something id love to be able to give out or throw at some people but ive also learned that what is good for me can be harmful to others at any rate if you feel curiousdesperatein need of healing i 10037 would recommend this over any expensive psychologuepharmaceutics or we

reread commentary  i just noticed and remembered how much during the experience i could notice how being me would have an impact on people around me and so me was important way beyond myself taking care of me is taking care of others in a way it is also a form of respect towards those you love to take care of yourself the way they would

at this point ive been writing a while and being this tired and slightly weed high i guess ill leave the other few stories of the other ceremonies for another time if anyone would be interested in reading those let me know and definitly also tell me about your experiences with ayahuasca and what it brought you

 my favorite part of rolling is the sensual experience—i want to touch all the things do the shrooms negate this aspect and skew the trip toward the visual 

 if i decide to stick with mdma only while my friend does both will we be out of sync in a way that will make it less fun for both of us

 is there a different supplementation regimen thats recommended or stick with the usual rollsafe recs

thanks in advance for your help friends"
18.704264,-3.75851,Addicted,"god damn 2cb is powerful
i dropped 2cb with my husband last night this is his second time doing bees while this is my nth time doing bees ive used it quite a bit as its my favorite drug in the world we took 16mg each i am sensitive to bees and 15mg will have me tripping pretty good while he is more tolerant and mostly gets physical and mental effects without much visual effects

not sure if this had any effect on it but the day before yesterday i did use 15mg of noopept in the morning perhaps it intensified the experience i know the half life of noopept is short but last nights experience was so intense i cant help but wonder if it had any effect

anyway just wow wow

everything was dialed up to eleven similar to mdma you know how your eyes will involuntarily roll back into your head well it wasnt rolling back into my head that my eyes were doing but everything was just so intense that id have to close them and just take it all in the sex was incredible reaching orgasm was difficult but incredibly pleasurable i kept thinking i was close to orgasm because it couldnt possibly get even more pleasurable but it just kept climbing and building in intensity the final result was amazing and fucking exhausting lol music was amazing the euphoria was out of this world the visuals incredible everything was 4d i felt like i existed in infinite dimensions tactile enhancements were ever present and boy was i feeling the love

i feel like after all my experiences with bees this was the first one that really allowed me to get 2cb like i get it now

a lot of parallels are drawn between 2cb and mdma and many users brush it off saying theyre completely different and not comparable other than extremely broad generalizations until last night i agreed but last night man it definitely felt like trippye not exactly the same no definitely not as pushy but certainly comparable in terms of sheer euphoria levels of empathy and feelings of love

just holy fuck you guys i fucking love 2cb more than lsd more than mdma its just such a good drug its so versatile you wanna roll 2cb can do it you wanna trip 2cb can do it you wanna see fucking god 2cmotherfuckingb not a new research chemical i promise can do it especially if you smoke some ganja and have a nitrous balloon or two

fuck yeah 2cb"
18.281069,-4.286597,Addicted,"mdma is such a beautiful drug 2nd time rolling with a little 2cb at the end
hey babies 3 

my husband and i rolled together for the second time on friday night god what a beautiful drug mdma is 85mg for me and 116mg for him with an 8mg dose of 2cb at the 4 hour mark right as we were sharply dropping off the peak peak roll effects lasted about 25maybe even 3 hours we took it on empty stomachs and supplemented as per rollsafeorgs instructions circa november 2016 or so think thats what i have written down

we talked cuddled kissed fucked pet the dog sooooo sooooft had a cool shower enjoyed music typical e stuff god kissing on e is the best thing ever if i spent an entire roll making out with my husband id be 100 okay with that

i gotta say that without the md redose the hangover is much much easier to handle the day after i felt tired but not stupid just tired honestly felt great aside from the exhaustion and today i feel pretty much baseline the duration of the roll while maybe 30 minutes shorter than when we boosted didnt actually feel shorter  we didnt have crazy time compression or jaw tension for that matter when the main roll ended it was okay we werent upset about it it felt alright even despite the effects ill describe in the next paragraph

the comedown off the drug itself did seem a little sadder than last time where we had a booster i got twinges of sadness and anxiety in my chest around the time we decided to take the bees and i even started thinking fuck im so tired i just want to sleep not trip fml but the twinges were ephemeral once the 2cb kicked in the sadness and anxiety completely dissipated and were replaced by a noticeably lifted mood and things because ever so slightly trippy with fractal closed eye visuals strange dreamlike visions not cevs and very mild open eye tracers tactile enhancement was also brought back slightly and sex  orgasm was not only possible but very good md sex was possible but a little floppy hehe

the transition to 2cb was seamless no comeup at all just boop bees land it was very cool

by hour six or seven or so we were beginning to fall asleep even with the active 2cb in our veins

8mg was definitely very small and a little underwhelming for me but since hes not nearly as experienced as i am with psychedelics we didnt want to trip balls and i didnt want to be up trippingrolling while he slept so we decided to start low and dose up if we wanted to we ended up just wanting to sleep lol

next time i think ill do 15mg 2cb at the end i can absolutely see how it brings the roll back fuck i love 2cb haha

anyway it seems like redosingboosting mdma brings me more trouble than its worth i think ill boost with bees from now on a much cleaner experience for sure even if its a little less pow than my first timewith the redose it certainly felt way less toxic and i cant help but wonder what the 2cb does pharmacologically with the mdma it really does kill the comedown is it just drugs being drugs or is it mitigating some toxicity or worsening it haha who knows i just know i feel super today

i hope yall had as lovely as weekend as we did lovelies 3"
15.411357,-14.430536,Addicted,"mdma  depression  the latest update
my wife has been going through a bout of depression after several months she started on wellbutrin she’s been on it for about a month the last time she did mdma was four months ago with a few good friends she was in depression then and not on medication all the friends dosed moderately at 100mg with no redose some of them rolled pretty well but two of them including my wife had very mild effects she has previously rolled fine on as low as 85mg the week following the roll she felt slightly more depressed than before but we weren’t sure if this was comedown hangover just her depression progressing or perhaps because she was somewhat let down by the expectations of her time with her friends the last time she was in depression a year ago we had rolled two times both of those previous rolls she had a temporary mood lift for the following week

anyway we were now debating whether or not to roll now she’s been a little gun shy because of last time and also having just started on wellbutrin a month ago after doing a good amount of reading about people’s experience with rolling on wellbutrin and taking into account her previous rolls while in depression we decided to give it a shot hoping that the last time negative comedown was not directly a result of her roll

so last weekend we rolled plugged 115 mg for her and 140 mg for me this was the first time plugging for either of us i’ve plugged many different substances i can say objectively that there is no causticity or irritation from the mdma i dissolved the crystals in a shot glass with 09 ml of warm water from a 1 ml syringe the crystals dissolved easily come up was around 3045 minutes peak was around 6090 minutes i was expecting it to hit harder with the rectal dose but we both had relatively mild rolls still good and stronger that her last roll but not mind blowing started feeling comedown after 34 hours i would call plugging a success it does reduce some of the uncertainty around gut load and timing of food consumption

now for the best news the last few days we’ve had a very positive afterglow no negative comedown and to put a cherry on it she’s had a huge libido boost

tldr on the fence about rolling while in depression rolled went great"

i took 10mg and gave him 20mg with 5 and 10mg booster doses approximately two hours later

i explained to him what to expect from amphetamine youll feel mildly to moderately euphoric chatty horny and youll just feel like doing stuff and will enjoy doing whatever i mentioned its a great opportunity to tackle some boring chores i also fully expected to just fool around sexually all day he took cialis to counter the stim dick

nope

instead we literally spent the entire day hanging out and talking with light make out sessions and fooling around interspersed but we still talked the whole time lol but really we just talked each others heads off and told stories all fucking day  it was honestly reminiscent of the kind of deep vulnerable talks that happen on mdma we talked about everything from our pasts to our friends to our families to politics to dogs to kids to music to food just fucking all of it but focused on the more personal stuff 

it was great we were able to talk about heavier issues that typically trigger insecuritiesanxieties in ourselves again much like mdma but obviously not as pushy or euphoric 

so yeah that took us both by surprise who knew that dextroamphetamine could be emotionally and interpersonally therapeutic who knew it could work kinda like mdma in bringing people closer together

20.74112,-6.123097,Addicted,"trip report mdma after 20 years
tl dr took mdma for the first time in over 20 years it was good but not as physical as i remember how to get that physical feeling back next time

i posted a couple of weeks agourl with my plans to take mdma for the first time in a long long while i tried to figure it out and it had been at least 20 years heres how it went

safetydosage after i saw the pills i hadnt seen them when i posted before i was able to look them up—blue “laugh now cry later” the reports were good but i tested one anyway my first time using those reagents i used all four and the color change confirmed that the pills contained mdma we had been warned that they were a highdose pill and the pill reportsurl said the same thing i took a rough half—the smaller half there’s no split line and it didn’t cut cleanly next time maybe will crush to a powder so it will divide more evenly 

took magnesium before 6hrs before dosing then again 2 hours before and after coming down ate vitaminccontaining fruits and veg during red bell pepper kiwi pineapple drank some coconut water and some regular water but did not measure how much had a glass of wine that night 

logistical details i needed to do this during the day while my kids were at school they each had play dates so i was free from 95 i let people know that id be out of cell range and any problems or concerns should be directed to my mom we drove to the beach about a 3040 minute drive spent the day there and i was home to pick up kids exactly on time

i took the halfpill around 10am didn’t look at the clock to see how long it took to come up or how long the initial peak lasted i took another small bit around 130 i was mostly down by 4pm

how it felt what we did some questions it was very mellow gentle lots of talking lots of holding we were at the beach lying on a blanket in the sand dunes it was about 60º outside maybe a little warmer but also breezy sitting up it was too chilly lying down with the protection from the wind the sun felt wonderful

it wasn’t as physical or visual as i remember from before what i remember from doing x in the 90s was the intense amount of physical pleasure that was my favorite part and what i was looking forward to again i used to love especially during the first peak feeling on the edge of having an orgasm just from someone stroking my skin or running their hands through my hair but it wasn’t like that this time physical contact felt good—holding hands lying down wrapped up with each other—but i didn’t have any desire to put my feet in the warm sand or pick up a pile of beach pebbles to fondle i had brought a hairbrush thinking how wonderful it would feel but i had no desire to take it out and use it

the lack of visual i can understand—it was daytime and we were in the sunlight 

i noticed the lack of speed or whatever amphetamines x used to be mixed with i didn’t want to walk—too bad because that beach was made for walking it was almost too mellow that night and the next day i did notice the effect of the jawclenching i must have been doing at the time i didn’t know i was clenching but my muscles are still sore two days later

i want that physical feeling back when i do this again next month do you think it wasn’t so physical because it was daytime or because it was too cold outside would it have been better at night i don’t think i can pull off a night without my kids so next time will probably be another daytime roll i’m thinking maybe at home with the shades drawn would be better—that way we could take clothes off if we wanted more skin we’d be warm we could have music… we wouldn’t have the connection with nature or the beauty or the textures of plants or sand but maybe that’s ok

or is it just that mdma is not the same as the x i was taking back then has the drug changed or is it different that the speedy x i was probably getting before

from this point until about 2130 we experienced full level 8a geometry and the most insane full body orgasmic euphoria that coincided with the epic jams of umphreys it felt like brendan and jake were taking us on a sexual fantasy while basically laying motionless in the abyss the lead guitar was like literally making love to each of us we were dominated by the music every emotion and feeling just brought more and more pleasure the mrs and i were kinda caressing each other but couldnt really move i felt her orgasm several times during the peaks of the jams i didnt physically orgasm but had full body euphoria for the whole peak very little was said between us during the first two hours minus some moans and groans of pleasure 

the cevs were full 8a omnidimensional and transcendent but still voluntary no major ego death no 8b she claimed glimpses but im not sure this chemical is capable of it the visuals were augmented by the the light show of the concert on tv color shifting strobes all added to the gorgeous imagery in our minds complete psychedelic landscapes and archetypal imagery just magical the oevs are super standard tryptamine not gonna expound 

we came around towards the encore around 2240 and were able to discuss the experience immediately upon standing wife had some stomach issues the famous tryptamine shits like a purging of all that intensity so much pleasure has to come at some cost i guess my stomach was a little queasy too so we downed 8mg ondansetron to settle things down around 2200 that worked well 

we sat and talked for a couple hours as the effects lingered and watched a little of louie cks brand new netflix special we love louie hes on the level for sure we enjoyed some apples and strawberries as a nice snack 

around t 5 we took some etizolam and she fell asleep around the 5 12 hour mark im pretty immune to etizolam and benzos genetically and stayed up for a while chatting in my head and browsing reddit i got really uncomfortable and hungry around t7 and downed some bread and butter with another etizolam sleep finally came around 0330 luckily my daughter promised before bed that shed let us sleep in a little so i got about 5 hours 

this was so different than last weeks experience  same dose same time line but we used music as a catalyst for blast off this time last time we had no music no distractions and it was a wholly cerebral trip with lots of discussions and working out issues

udrugsaremagics post on using ketamine made me think along with other factors about how drug use plays into depression i think often people use drugs and realize that they are the easiest way to alter the mind and so find an easy means to soften the pain of life even when many dont realize that is what they are doing

i think many people are depressed by the definition especially in the us and its not until drugs give us an easy out do we often realize how heavy the burden of life is also there are other drugs that help us to open our mind often leading us the realization that shit sucks haha its taken me a long time to have the awareness of the realities of life while simultaneously actually being able to compose myself on a daily basis i think in actuality most people live their lives sort of dodging reality creating their own drugs that help them not to think about whatever they feel that sucks but us drug users are conveniently told our happiness is fake and chemically induced and somehow inferior but in reality i think almost everyone one way or another is escaping reality to some extent naturally or unaturally especially psychedelics have opened my eyes to looking at life for what it is and really it aint that pretty but as true as the saying ignorance is bliss can be i would personally never choose ignorance

im glad this was started up as funny as some of the posts on rdrugs were i like the idea of a more focused discussion 

that being said what was the experience that most shaped your view of substance use 

id honestly say my first experience was the catalyst for my current stance that sounds rather obvious but let me expand on that 

i was in the military and struggling with what was then undiagnosed manic depression up to this point id never touched a drug nor did i drink i was adamantly against substance use i didnt have a problem with others using but i was sure that it wasnt my thing

so finding myself completely lost in a terrible place both mentally and physically i was desperate for anything i had heard meditation was a good practice to get into and managed to end up on erowid hours of research later and id fallen in love with the idea of entheogens it was so radically different purpose wise than any thing id ever heard about drug use 

a few weeks later i had gotten some hbwr and was about to embark on my first experience some people love lsa some hate it i love what it did for me that night was one of the most enlightening experiences ive ever had i remember facing so many repressed feelings i called my dad the next morning to tell him i loved him we never had been emotionally open and after this weve been so much closer

i am planning on guiding a group of 34 friends in their first experience of mdma and would like advice and suggestions on making this a positive trip for them

i have been intensely interested in mdma for months have done a lot of research on safety set and setting and about a week ago my partner and i went on a shared “journey” which was the first mdma trip for both of us although we have used other psychedelics in the past this was really lovely and has rekindled positive vibes in an already good marriage

my friends are all in their 40s and 50s in professional health and mentalhealth service careers though none of us are medical doctors we are married with kids and otherwise have pretty boring but meaningful lives none of my friends would be likely to go to a rave for instance

here’s what i’m thinking so far

    go a bit low on dosage 100mg and no redosing unless someone is having a good experience and asks for it this should give people 23 hours of significant effect

    we’d do this in the daytime one of us has a large private office we can all clear out our schedules for the day responsibly and be available from noon onwards

    i would not dose with them i think they’d be more comfortable and feel more safe knowing one person is sober and i’m happy to stay out of the experience this time plus it’s been fairly recent for me and it’s likely better for me to wait a while i’ll have other chances with my wife down the road 

    i can have a gentle playlist of soft journey instrumental music going in the background

    invite people to close their eyes as they start feeling the effects and ask them to “go inside feel the music follow your breath and go ahead and let go”

    a bit later invite them to open the eyes and if they are moved to do so to take turns sharing what they are experiencing and feeling with the group

    if they want to “sample” some of the healing effects of the drug they can be invited to think about something about themselves they would like to change and to be with the feelings that come up as they think about it or to think about a person in their family they would like to connect with better and to “go into” the different layers of that relationship

    invite them to smile into each other’s faces

    invite them to get up and dance to the music

so over the weekend i tried out a single tab of dob 14 mg i have been reading about it and was a little apprehensive about duration and effect for those of you who dont know i am married and have kids so a full day long trip could be a little challenging

not knowing how long it would last and how i would take it i cleared it with the wife first and dropped a tab at 9am dob is known to have a slow come up i can confirm it was 90 minutes before i started to feel definite effects a bit cold and a bit jittery by 3 hours i was starting to feel full effects i got no visuals and was pretty clear id say it felt like maybe a half tab of lsd25 5060ug a noticable body buzz but pretty functional

so i guess the main interesting thing about this drug at this dose is i stayed like this basically all day the feeling did start to lessen by late night around 11pm i was getting ready for bed still felt something but was definitely less i did manage to get my wife to get in the mood and was able to test this stuff out for sexual enhancement ill say it was promising since i was at the tail end i dont think it was a true test but i did have good control with no diminished sensation or erection still cant beat lsd but definitely enhanced

was able to fall asleep probably 1am woke up pretty clear slight headache but that might have actually been from skipping coffee the day before overall it was pretty good i do want to try 2 tabs to get to trip levels but a full day of tripping could be difficult to schedule i did not experience any real negative effects"

we have all seen and talked about combos candyflip hippyflip weed with whatever etc but doses timing roa are all over the place how about some actual recipes heres what i mean


ingredients

30 mg 4fa

7 mg 2cb

1 gel cap

water based lube

preparation

weigh out the 4fa and 2cb and fill both directly into gel cap set aside until ready to use

how to serve

be ready to do this all in one go you wont have a lot of time before the gel cap starts to melt

tap your gel cap so all the powder is on the larger side of the cap

carefully open your cap back up

drop 36 drops of lube into the gel cap basically fill it to just below the rim of the larger half quickly close the gel cap back up

lube up the outside of the gel cap as well as at least one finger and quickly insert the gel cap into rectum as far as you can with one finger

wash hands well


so what have you got any gordon ramsay or julia childs of drugs here

edit adjusted the recipe to 405 the 2cb rectal come up overshadows the subtle low dose 4fa i think taking 2cb rectal at the same time as 4fa rectal is a little bit of a waste of the 4fa maybe 2cb first then 4fa at peak"

 65 for the complete test kit is a lot of money i understand that its a good value since its for 50 tests or whatever but im not planning on doing this fifty times is there a smaller test kit out there with all four reagents but smaller amounts of each something that would cost less

 i read the testing instructions but can someone give me a summaryprimer the point of testing is to make sure that a theres nothing bad in the pill and b there is actually mdma in the pill is that right 

 for dosing how to i make sure that im taking the right dosage if im not going to trust whats in the pill as indicated by the need to test whats in it it seems i shouldnt trust what the stated dosage of the pill either do i weigh the pill i only have a standard digital kitchen scale

 i dont have the luxury of overnight childcare am i crazy to think that i can do this while theyre at school x was always an eveningnight activity but even when i used to take more than one dose i dont think the trip lasted longer than eight hours

im thinking dose around 830 drop the kids off and be home at 9am get them some afterschool playdates so i can have fun all day long but be ok to pick them up around 530 i remember that it always took around 45 minutes to start feeling it then a bit more to really start peaking am i remembering more or less right does this seem like a ridiculous plan

the premature ejaculation is severe its not the kind that can be beat by ssri drugs or lidocaine  this is the boner to spurt back to soft within 20 seconds kind the worst kind 

nothing worked alcohol wasnt strong enough heroin was too strong and i could never come  lidocaine added maybe 5 seconds 

then i found methadone taking about 30mgs in the morning about every two days made it so i had a completely normal sex life  it didnt matter where or when  if a spontaneous blowjob came about i wood bee good for ten minutes i was cured 

also it takes pain cravings away so theres that up side too 

the price of methadone can be stiff though and it takes 2 hours to kick in so if my girlfriend wakes up horny and i havent dosed yet it being the dose day i am usually screwed  

id be very interested in hearing from all you other premature ejaculators 

i also need advice would maybe taking 5 mg of cialis w my dose every 2 days be safe cialis was supposed to last 38 hrs if u dont fuck right away "

6.040637,5.8492236,Addicted,"notes on 2′oxopcmdeschloroketaminedck
i’ve used dck maybe 20 times the last couple of months and thought i would summarize my findings on this research chemical 

first some personal info i’m male in my 30s kids wife i have a lot of experience of psychedelics and all sorts of drugs spanning over two decades my wife doesn’t approve of my using drugs so i keep it on the down low all trips are taken in bed while everyone is asleep i usually listen to music think and write while tripping 

1 i have not come across a drug that is as antianxiety and antidepressive as dck is i’m quite high strung introverted and prone to depression for days after using i feel very happy outgoing positive life affirming the wife has definitely noticed me being a lot happier since i came across this substance but she doesn’t know why the afterglow is powerful for almost the whole day after but i would say i still feel better than normal for one or two days after that as well

2 i’ve tried plugging and snorting plugging results in a clean long trip around four hours i’d say i feel very mentally clear lots of psychological insights works wonders for creative writing plugged i find that dck has a stimulant edge which makes it a bit difficult to fall asleep afterwards i’ve often found myself lying awake through the night only catching a few hours sleep however the afterglow the day after is so fantastic that i don’t even feel tired on three hours sleep just content and positive snorting is somehow trippier and more sedative i don’t know if this is placebo but it feels like that every time on the advice of some friendly reddit user i’ve filled a nasal spray with 10 ml of distilled water and about 300 mg dck which i then use as i please works very well

3 as for doses i´ve not gone very high i’m a believer in less is more and besides i need to stay on planet earth in case the kids wake up or something like that highest i’ve gone is 40 mg plugged  maybe 20 mg from the nasal spray spread out during a couple of hours i like 40 mg to start with i find it trippy but not overwhelmingly so

4 one night i took maybe 20 mg dck and around 10 mg 4acodmt that combination was absolute magic i can´t wait to try it in higher doses also i’ve found that using a high dose of dck the night before tripping on say lsd is quite a good idea since the afterglow is so nice the day after dck i wake up feeling happy and positive and to then take some acid was very pleasant

5 so far no negative experiences to report i feel absolutely fine after using if for a couple of times per week for about two months i’d say the potential for addiction is quite high not that i’ve noticed any craving or physical dependancy but it just feels so damn good if one isn’t careful i can certainly imagine one wanting to use it all the time

6 in summary dck is definitely top three best drugs i’ve come across during my life as a psychonaut it’s fun incredibly versatile cheap lasts longer than regular k or 2fdk i find it much less visual than k or 2fdk maybe higher doses are needed but as i said to combine it with a tryptamine like 4acodmt worked very well and that definitely produced visuals 

what i like most about it is that it does wonders as a tool for exploration of the psyche and as a tool for writing it makes me very creative and insightful i’ve produced a major amount of good quality material since i started using it i’ve also understood a lot of things about my self that i’ve struggled to grasp before for other dad trippers out there give it a try

7 i should maybe the batch comes from a swedish vendor i don’t know where it originally is from i’ve understood that different batches produce different results this one is slightly tan looks a bit like sugar not caustic actually slightly sour

from my reading of rdrugs and rdrugsover30 it seems a lot of us have some history with mental health issues be it depression bipolar disorder anxiety or any of the spectrums outside of these do we use to self medicate i know i do for sure 

on that note is self medicating and inherently devious practice if you even mention it to a medical professional or anyone honestly the reaction you receive seems to be pretty negative as a whole im not sure if im helping or hurting myself most days while others im convinced that without my varied substance use im not sure id still be here 

ive been feeling rather low as of late and pretty suicidal to be honest i seem to get this bouts of suicidal thoughts for no apparent reason there isnt a cause nothing happens to which i reply killing myself will fix this i think a lot of it stems from the lack of apparent meaning in life dont get me wrong i think i lead a pretty solid life ive been making a much more comfortable living after getting out of the military have friends to be around when i want to super introverted being alone calms me and a job that i feel pretty proud of i even fill my downtime with school and playing music yet i still feel incredibly empty drugs fill this void they bring the magic of childhood back i know this cant be healthy but maybe some of us are just wired the wrong way maybe some of us run on 240 while the world only puts out 120 as an electrical analogy

i think like some of you here my middleaged drug experiences are quite different to those when i was younger so i wonder if you can give me your opinion on what would be good to try

my experiences are now had at home with my wife and we are looking for the removing of inhibitions sex enhancement opening up to each other talking bonding enjoying music some therapy and so on our normal routine is mdma followed by 2cb and a little bit of ket later on and its normally bloody great but it is losing its magic a little bit ive gone off doing 2cb alone at the moment as i had a bit of a rough one recently which has left me a little bit wary of pure psychs due to anxiety which i am sure will resolve in time but i dont feel like doing any on their own right now but after mdma 2cb is amazing for me

so im looking for something empathic and could perhaps combine well with 2cb and ket ie put me into a nonanxious state and to enhance connectivity with my wife mentally and sexually

ive read the reports about 6apb on here and on rdrugs but the headless chicken nature of that forum makes gleaning any decent info from there almost futile and a little about 4fa

is there anything more you can tell me about those substances or anything else to consider 

ive never tried any rcs and only got back into drugs after the ban if its any help i have tried lsd 2cb speed coke mushies mda mdma mdmb ket weed psychs are okay but my favourite has always been mdma dont particularly like stims other than e which is unique really never enjoyed coke or speed and i gather 6apb can be a bit tweaky

sorry long post but i think this is better off here 

i recently acquired 250mg of this chemical from a reliable source ive been waiting for a nice time to do it and the extra hour from daylight savings time sounded great were both in our mid 30s with a one school age kid im a critical care specialist and my wife runs a small business and i have four days off of work woo

after a light dinner of grilled shrimp and homemade caesar salad the king of salads with the kid soundly asleep we insufflated 15mg for her and 20mg for me shes sensitive to psychs so she preloaded with 2 mg etizolam i took my normal nighttime meds propranolol 40mg and oxycodone 75mg for a chronic condition 

weighed on the gem20 so doses are approx insufflation was painless and drip was slow and nasty just like a tryptamine first alerts around 30mins with stoned body load warm and comforting at about an hour game on the come up was so easy and relaxing and quickly turned erotic we retired to the bedroom for some sexytime and the peak started as we were conjoined into some blissful cosmic miasma of flesh and brilliant closed eye visuals dancing imagery of mandala patterns and humanoid shapes very sexual in nature neither could orgasm and i started getting some upset stomach and annoying leg twitchesfasciculations that were a little concerning 

we decided to head back to the couch and i took 8mg of zofran to offset the tummy troubles after a big trippy bowel movement at around t3 my visuals were stilll very strong open and closed classic tryptamine with a new 3d effect and lots of swirling smoke phenomenon on pattenered surfaces neat  still barely any headfuck at this dose  we had some expansion of thought making oddball connections to ideas and objects but no thought looping and really no ego loss time flowed normally or slightly quickly actually 

at t4 my wife was essentially at baseline but still had a lot of mental energy and clarity my daughter heard us giggling madly and came downstairs to investigate we watched some bbc planet earth and awed at the patterns in nature for a while i was still having residual visuals the kid saw the same things i swear kids are naturally on drugs 247  we sent her up to bed and exactly at hour 5 we dosed more etizolam and were asleep within an hour dosed at 745pm and asleep by 1245am great duration  its hard to fit psychs into my schedule and this was perfect 

this was an extremely pleasant and fun psychedelic in these low doses you still get visuals and some expansion of thought but very little anxiety or confusion compared to 4acodmt just a really great chem for relaxing sexy times and having a good 4 hour giggle session awesome compound  will explore deeper and maybe iv my favorite roa for solo trips  "

well didnt really do shit

haha honestly maybe too soon to tell but there was no immediate relief like you hear about with iv infusion

we did approx 57 mg insufflated every 10 minutes 5x for a total of 2535 mg over 50 minutes wife is 120 lbs this is based on the reddit post in my first ketamine post its lower than what i see in other recommendations but we wanted to start conservatively

she did say she felt a little dizzy and out of it not in a badqueasy way but just in a slightly intoxicated way we did this at night just before bed she never really got any sense of relief although she did say she slept a little better which is a win mornings are very hard for her though and that was not improved

i did read a post here on reddit saying that they didt really feel relief from insufflated therapy until the third day so were willing to keep at it for a bit perhaps slightly larger dose not sure if were going to do consecutive days or every other at this point im leaning toward consecutive

a little more info my wife is dealing with negative though patterns we both recognize that the best thing for her long term would be to work on combatting the negative thoughts rather than just looking for a substance that will change her mood that being said the thoughts are so strong right now that it is hard for her to function and to fight the thoughts we are hoping the ketamine can give her enough of a window of relief that she can focus some more energy on fighting her negative thought patterns right now the strategies that she is trying is meditation consciously correcting false negative thoughts and therapy starting friday

ill update again after our next session"

so the wife was out of town and i had some time to experiment on my own on friday i plugged 5 mg 5meomipt weve been a little hit or miss with this substance now we mainly used it to enhance sex in the past it works but hasnt been as great as acid the main downside is that it gives my wife some anxiety and nausea not just a normal nausea though kind of like a bad weed trip nausea so i wanted to try plugging it to see if the negative effects were lessened i felt a little bit of the nausea before just not as bad as my wife i think plugging was better for the nauseaanxiety but as usual the come up was rougher by evening that experiment was over i still had some energy left so i took a 15 mg 2cb to chill the rest of the evening slept around 2 felt fine the next day

day 2  saturday usually my wife and i do mdma together with long breaks in between this weekend i sent my wife out with friends and mdma care packages so that meant i had a free mdma cycle what ive been putting off trying due to the wait times is 6apb so i capped 125 mg and gave that a whirl maybe it was because i was taking it alone but itd was very okay it was kind of like mdma but with much less of the physical warmth waves and tingles i think as far as notmdma substances go i am liking 4fa better

day 3  sunday my past tests with 4acomet had been underwhelming so today i dosed 50 mg granted i may have had some cross tolerance with the 2cb and 5meomipt but overall it was a great dose i probably wont dose lower that 50 mg again it was still very clear with a subtle mood lift

i finally got around to testing out 6apb again my first test of this batch was 125 mg a while back it was very underwhelming this time i dosed 175 mg and it was great we dropped around 6 pm come up was expectedly long 2 hours kept going for a good 56 hours got to sleep 4 am

all in all awesome just keep in mind that people have been saying that the si batch of 6apb is significantly more potent people mention 100 mg of si 6apb to be very strong this rgn 6apb at 175 mg was a just right dose i could imagine going higher if i wanted to get deeper

its been a couple days and so far no come down issues

btw im okay with vendor names for the sake of discussing differences in potency or quality no sourcing in terms of asking where or how to obtain though"

i first took mdma in 91 or 92 good pills in them days doves calis snowballs took speed as well sometimes but never particularly liked it had a great time when the free party scene was still going in the uk until the govt put an end to it all in 94 

until the autumn just gone i hadnt taken mdma in about 12 years back in the day whether i was doing a half at a funfair dropping 3 at an allnighter or doing a thursday thru to sunday weekender i would always feel totally wrecked and depressed and only by the following thursday lunchtime would the grimness start to lift i would feel positive again and be ready for the next one

so received wisdom would have it that hangovers get worse as you get older and yet having get hold of some e again now  in my mid forties the hangovers are near nonexistent in fact i get a positive after glow just feel a bit tired the day after and regularly go for a 75 mile bike ride the day after that no suicide tuesday or much in particular this didnt happen a single time in my teens and twenties regardless of how much i took

took 5 mg 3meopcp in a gel cap absolutely no discomfort one of the easiest substances to plug so far come up was very slow for a rectal administration took about 45 minutes to really feel anything but at 45 it definitely kicked in

overall it was mellow easier going than k but it was also a pretty small dose i guess i still dont really get the love for disassociates it was ok a bit of body buzz some numbing kind of like alcohol with less fun i guess thats what i said about k too but at least at lower doses i think i like this better than k i hung out and watched some tv felt pretty relaxed i dont think low dose k was as good for just chilling for me k was more a lie in bed drug for me even at low doses

i guess so far with k and now with 3meopcp they both seem pretty easy to handle at low and moderate doses i have no real compulsion to redose and im not feeling like sleep will be a problem im at 4 hours now and feeling close to baseline higher doses may be a different story so for changing it up maybe sometimes on weekday thing it might find a place

19.250923,5.1975284,Addicted,"had a gram of hexen first time today some thoughts about this iffy chemical
this is gonna be long cause im stimming my nuts off feeling shitty earlier today in the middle of a few days off have some paperwork to do but its boring wife is a little lethargic from too much oxy use in the last few days which shes since ran out of  and suggests we try the hexen thats been sitting in my cabinet for two weeks to see how it does as a pick me up ive read all the horror stories of this chemical the fiendish compulsion the cardiovascular side effects and the psychosis with too much so ive had my doubts but it was so cheap i added it to my last si order with the dck 

i dont love dopaminergic stimulants that much but i do enjoy some blow on the rare occasion but blow is really bad for my heart so hexen sounded like a reasonable substitute we started around 1pm after a pretty crappy lunch fast food lunch with a modest 20mg bump 

warning i took my propranolol around 6 am so theres still about half my dose in my system not a great plan to mix nonselective bblocker with ndris bad vasoconstriction and angina can occur im aware of this and have some nitroglycerin if i really need to drop the vasoconstriction down fast wife took a half dose of metoprolol this morning its cardioselective so should be fine we also have plenty of etizolam to counter side effects need be 

t0001 damn that shit burns  wow didnt expect that wife took it first to be guinea pig i waited about 10 minutes 

t0005  already feeling clear headed and motivated pacing around the room wife feels nice and calm her opiate withdrawal symptoms are quickly waning dopamine is a great thing sinuses are numb now hard palate is numb also drip is tasteless and fine 

t0020  talking about lots of shit flowing easily but already feeling like it wasnt enough we take another 10mg bump to get to 30mg which is a good place per other reports this is nice feels a lot like good coke but not as smooth more jittery 
i sit down and hammer out some work stuff blabbering the whole time

t0045  okay wow already craving more short lived euphoria physical and a little mental heart rate is already up to 80 from 60 

t0055 we redose another small bump because the chatting is slowing down and the clarity is waning boom right back at it pacing and talking persist she is way calmer than i am but stims do that to her maybe a little add it would make sense 

t 0200 time for another dose 20 mg on a scoop  this shit is unrelenting but im now getting really horny which stims do to me without fail we have about an hour before we have to pick the kid up at the bus stop down the block we head upstairs for a little play time we both orgasm really hard and pretty easily considering a mild case of stim dick but my desire took over  i take a hot shower and feel pretty decent 

t 0250 time to get the kid so another 20mg bump super clear mentally now hr is high 120s for me 130s for her feeling the peripheral effects cold feet and hands mild sweating rapid respiratory rate lots of jaw clenching for me we drive to grab some food for the kiddo to keep her occupied driving feels nice and easy like im hyper acutely aware of everything super safe i stick to the speed limits shes really a good girl she needs very little and is super sociable always shes super tired so an early dinner and early bedtime are in the cards 

t 0400 yikes feeling pretty shitty decide to skip this one and take 25mg etizolam to offset the nasty effects wife is weirdly nauseous and throws up a little she takes an ondansetron to help i go upstairs for a little me time and wank again jesus stims jack my libido up 

t 0500 comedown is mitigated by etizolam and rest i use a heating pad on my feet to warm up 
i put the kid to bed early like 630 pm its fine shes tired and ready come downstairs and eat a pbj sandwich which my wife had also and made one for me eating was not terribly hard i take my nightly 10mg oxycodone with food that should help  

t 0600  we take a metoprolol each for the heart rate and stupidly decide to bump another 30mg well right back at it i get on here and im writing right now on the last bump can you tell  its easy to focus on a task remarkably after so many redoses my heart rate is getting real high but i feel pretty damn good not getting the vasoconstriction now maybe thats the etizolam from earlier 

now 745 pm we decide this is the last bump 15mg or so not feeling antsy or jittery just wanna write  shes getting into her business doings and redditing also feeling pretty great  gonna cap it off with some 9lb hammer pure indica we got at the dispensary last week maybe some more etizolam before bed 

tldr  stim ranting from a nonstim guy this is some nasty shit  super compulsive but maybe we are taking lower doses and its not lasting as long it seems pretty pure i trust the source fine white crystals very light and fluffy and a little sticky but sniffs just fine yucky cardiovascular side effects for sure no palpitations like coke though so less direct beta stimulation seems less likely to cause arrhythmia this has no use in my arsenal but i wanted to try it because of all the hype maybe for a younger heart sexual activity was gratifying its pretty clear headed when you bump it but the comedown is nasty and dirty gonna flush the rest probably sadly its not a good thing for us to have around 



day after update we slept okay but were incredibly lethargic today probably on account of too much everything  no worries we didnt flush the hexen so we are gonna keep it going and that seems to be working out just fine very focused on reddit this morning lol

the other day i had an open bar event to go to i often find myself drinking more than i should at these things maybe its because im such a cheap bastard and i cant pass up a free drink ive found that taking a drug that i believe should not be mixed with too much alcohol give me the mental discipline to limit my alcohol consumption ive done this with low dose lsd and this time with 60 mg 4fa

it worked out great ive been trying different things with 4fa lately not definitive yet but i think oral may be better than rectal for this substance 60 mg gave me a good little body buzz i limited my alcohol to 3 glasses of whiskey over 4 hours or so they complimented each other quite well

the 4fa was taken around 330 pm i slept easily and restfully around midnight

i guess im still testing the waters a bit with how often i can use 4fa at low doses i know the problem is at these doses i probably wont feel the effects of damage while they are happening so if anyone has any information or even theories about dangers of low dose 100mg 4fa let me know so far i am still usually less than once a week but ive crept into twice in one week"

overall it was amazing and everyone had a great time it was more visuals than i was expecting and definitely very unique from shrooms which i have more experience with im glad i didnt do any shrooms and once feeling the acid definitely wouldve known i wouldnt have wanted the shrooms anyways haha

the only question i guess i have is one of my friends who tried it for the first time said she would prefer more visuals without any more of a headspace since she didnt think she could handle more headspace change she just wanted more visuals ive heard some weed can potentiate the visuals but not sure if it was also add any discomfort since no one but me was a regular cannabis user"

since i was around 40 at the time i actually talked to my doctor and got a prescription cialis had a free trial coupon so my doctor wrote me a prescription for that he also gave me a free sample pack of viagra first the bad news when everything is working right ed meds dont do all that much for you i had heard stories of super erections and tiny refractory periods it didnt seem to make much difference to me when i was ok but when i had mdma dick it did fix that

ok so on to the next problem real ed meds are expensive i mean crazy expensive so i ventured out on the google machine and i found the least sketchy but still cheap meds from india site so far i have ordered twice from this site the first time was a sampler pack you pay shipping 29 and you get 10 each of the three major ed med generics they all work a little differently and its nice to have some options

i am a recovering addict and bipolar 1 and i have lyme disease i think what you are leaving out is the fact that most addicts are predisposed and thats genetics thats science its a truth so that means there is some kind of chemical or human makeup that makes it more likely to be an addict right

now that does not guarantee someone is an addict not at all but it helps get someone there most addicts have some environmental circumstance at an early age that leads to a im not enough component they also often not always start at an early age or sometime before there brain is developed substance use is almost like self medicating it is a symptom but not the problem and as the brain is still developing there are pathways created by the consistent reward drugs provide to the brain all different kinds of chemicals are released depending on the drug

that impact on the brain makes addiction less of a choice the longer you impact the brain with drug use the more the brain changes i hope this makes sense lol this causes the desire for substances physically and mentally addicts like myself move substance use up the hierarchy of our survival skills it becomes more important than food more important than shelter more important than begin around others and socializing when it becomes more important than typical survival skills it also becomes less and less of a choice for the addict now not everyone who uses substances becomes an addict we must remember that we all have different makeups and no two brains are the same so imo i just dont feel comfortable writing something like this off and making it black and white its gray like everything else besides calculus not funny

initially i believe we all had a choice but over time we lose the ability to make that choice clearly we have changed our brains and our bodys and now suffer from a disease it is no longer up to you the you that once was known is now gone and not coming back for that matter and now what is left is a changed person who no longer has as clear of a choice as nonaddicts and this isnt a bad thing we are all entitled to our journey"

hey guys 

had few questions about 6apb finally after about a 10week break from anything like this got to try some 6apb i’ve been sitting on with my buddy never taken it before we took 150mg of the succinate and first thing is wow if mdma was a 1010 this was like a 85 or 9 out of 10  insane smooth rolling for like 65 hours i can’t believe off one dose you roll for so so long it’s crazy  

k question time the only thing we noticed is it just wasn’t “quite” their  like we were rolling feeling the love in a non forced 6apb way rather than pushy but there wasn’t that crazy “peak pow” moment it was smooth  almost as if you took mdma at say 125mg rather than 150mg we felt like we were just one tiny notch below 

for people who have done this  would if we took a bit more say 175mg or 185mg would we get that “face rolling” or is this what 6apb is 

i decided to stick to the lower end at 150mg but does going up make it roll harder or is what we felt what we get 

1010 would do again  longer smoother non forced love and empathy chatty eurphoric insane how good and close to pure mdma it was  sedating but stimulating  i am noticing a bit more of a hangover today than mdma tho tired headache nothing crazy

1130 5mg instant releaseir adderall

1200 insufflate 5mg adderall after this ill start bringing cannabis into the picture as neededwanted

530 fiance will be home dont need to be sober but i want to be sober enough to spend a good afternoon with her we havent had too much time together so my plan is just to be sober enough to be able to normally interact itll have been about 10 hours after dosing the acid and a few hours after dosing the adderall so i think for the most part im just expecting to be stoned and mentally exhausted

i will be using pretty much this same dosing regimen but with alcohol included for a concert in a little over a month which is partially why i want to test it out but i also havent tripped alone or tripped at all in a while im also looking forward to combining psychedelics and stimulants as i havent done that before and think i will really enjoy the effects

my only real thing im uncertain about is insufflating the adderall ive never snorted anything and i feel like the adderall pill is mostly just filler and i dont know how healthy that is to snorti just realized coming on to this sub that i could actually plug it haha has anyone plugged adderall or amphetamine in general idk i might just stick with oral for that well see how i feel

i just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts and also just wanted a place to write my thoughts out this is my plan for the upcoming tuesday thought you guys would enjoy hearin my plan and i could possibly get some positive feedback

last night was going over to a friends for board game night i was already exhausted and had had 8 5mg adderall irs sitting in my drug box for a few months i decided to take one about 6pm it was a gentle comeup until about 730 held strong until about 10 or 11 but unfortunately had lingering effects till past 2am as i didnt sleep till almost 3 it was very similar in potency to downing 50mg of caffeine noticeable but not overwhelming at all more euphoria than caffeine less body load but also a much harsher comedown and a bit of a hangover this morning overall was a good experience and i had just the energy i wanted to enjoy the party and power through more cannabis than id normally be able to handle while still staying awake haha

this was my first time using stims in a while besides caffeine my only other experience was 5 10mg ir adderall that i had my hands on about 2 and a half years ago that i took on separate occasions also combined with cannabis overall a really positive experience though i will keep moderation with use to keep the magic and since it still is decently hard on the body and mind as far as drugs come"

17.113752,-16.95074,Addicted,"10 mg 3meopcp plugged
second go at 3meopcp the first time was in a gel cap this time was a 1 ml syringe

the first time i reported the come up to be very slow 45 min and very mild this time the come up began within 10 minutes and got pretty well up to speed within 20 min or so effects were significantly stronger there was a warm tingly feeling not a lot of headspace mainly body but very different from 5 mg im finding 3meopcp to be a much more recreational chem than ketamine ketamine makes me feel numb and if i try to walk i feel slightly dizzy with a tinge of queasiness 3meopcp has less numbing more buzz and less dizziness i didnt feel any queasiness

at 10 mg it was a relaxing easy high no visual distortion or psychedelic effects i could see using this as an alcohol replacement every once in a while i think the recommended wait times are around 1 week minimum for long term tolerance though

dosed at 830pm slept 1230am sleep was fine woke up just the slightest bit foggy but not bad at all much better than alcohol"

941 
doc is back on his phone probably writing uo his own stupid trip report before i can   i confront him he denies hes doing anything and asks me what im doing and laughs

i notice two minute updates are probably why people dont document until after the trip to get only key things down but everything feels so important now

16.5703,15.856233,Addicted,"lsdtrip report 120 or 150 where i met my ancestors got killed and was mourned for by them
hello reddit

first of all i would like to apologize beforehand for any mistakes i most likely have made in this first post of mine here english is not my native language but i try to do my best

so i wanted to share my most amazing trip with you and i hope you enjoy it 

one year ago me and my boyfriend took 2 lsd stamps which contained 150ug i think it was the first time he ever tried it while i’ve had some experience with it already including max of 800ug i think so we took it in our apartment while lounging on the sofa and at some moment we started cuddling and kissing while waiting lsd effects to open up eventually the cuddling transformed into tender love making i’d rather not call it sex because it felt like there was nothing dirty unnatural nothing that has a fleur of secrecy and biology it was a feeling of a biblical scale it felt like i knew him and he knew me it was very proper in the sense like the “songs of the songs” is a part of the old testament and that’s when my most amazing trip has begun…

i felt that i am not just myself but i contain so many other women who are actually me too who were born in other ages in different countries in different classes but each of them was me myself as we’ve all had soul same was for him—we had sex and i felt like every time i have ever been born to this place i was meeting him and i loved him all this was happening through time—we were making love in all of our many faces born throughout history we made love through the epochs it was the first young love and it was a farewell love before he went to war and he was my landlord and he was a jew and i were a german just our looks were changing but we were still ourselves in love and twirling around each other like quarks 

so i entered the brightest part of the trip during this unbelievable and harmonic interaction between me and him and when i had an orgasm… 

the next thing that happened to me was i suppose what people call the ego death i was in a blank black space absolutely empty i wasn’t even sure if i am separated from everything else or am i a part of it i couldn’t differ myself from my surrounding but it wasn’t scary at all i felt like i am a flying thought but i wanted to see if there is anything but me and thought that would be difficult because i needed to see it first and i need eyes to see but how can i have eyes if i am a thought i need to see someone’s else eyes to understand that someone can watch me just like i can do so it was a paradoxal trip that made me move around and look for something distinctively separated from me 

so i went down and there was an endless field of snow and i was flying above it like a gentle cold breeze i was playing with the tops of the birches making them dance with me a little

then i came to a mysterious place it was a forest full of giant pines that were dark red near the roots and looked strong stately and calm i realized that these are my ancestors taking me to some sacred and secret place 

there was a cave in the center of the forest and then i realized that i am a tiny crystal of salt that will turn into a crystal some day i realized that i am water i realized that i am no different from my boyfriend and we are coming from this place i was born a crystal a million times and he was the sun shining upon me telling me he loves me and playing sunny bunnies with me 

then i’ve had a weird vision that a giant block of marble has smashed me and has broken me and i started crying and weeping because that actually felt like i am destroyed that i am broken and that was so sad and i couldn’t stop crying for myself i never cried like that in my life but there was help my tears were water and i felt that water is a very important thing because all the worthy things in life come with sweat tears and blood and i felt that i need to be mourned for and symbolically die in the water just to be born again i felt that water is connected to women a lot and that it is very important to cry together that it cures so all the women of my clan that were ever born were crying with me and i felt very light again i felt that i can live no matter how bad i was broken that i have support i felt that something very important very ancient and very true was shared with me they have seen everything and they are overwhelmed with dolor for the pain was present in this world for ever and it will never go away as long as the humans are physical creatures but they were hope giving nothing is broken forever and no one shall be standing alone in her or his pain that the pain goes away if it’s shared and cried for 

after this the effects started to slowly go down… 

this trip was like a catharsis for me and i have never ever experienced anything close to its strength beauty and meaningfulness on beiger amounts of lsd or other psychedelic drugs i hope i was able to express the vividness of this beautiful vision"

i guess ill start with setup
i did it at night outside on a blanket with a pillow and nearby candle for light i took a good 10 minutes of quiet meditation while i prepareed my dmt a dab rig with a titanium nailice cold water as i prefer now im not sure as to the exact amount as i dont have an accurate enough scale roughly jeez idk 50 to possibly 100mg maybe more

now for the fun part

i heat my nail take my hit and lay down the ringing and blast off sets in i hold my hit as i reach the bright white light and i let out my hitin my head from here 
immediately time gos in reverse the hit goes back in i sit back up pick up the pipe and reverse inhale i heard one heartbeatboom boom and then hyperspace like doctor strange open your eye scean but times infinity moving at indescribable speed then suddenly a dead stop middle of the universe floating im drawn backwardsastral body to physical body  slowly i hear the next heartbeat boom boom 
and im thrown into hyperspace again flying threw incredibly intricate geometric spirals that stretched on to infinity my body did a color spectrum with the bodys behind me each a mili second behind while those in front showed the future i watched in line as those in front raised a hand to check and as it drew near mine raised the sound was like a universal symphony that connected directly to how i felt deafening loud and tense like the middle of a grand symphony piece mirroring how i felt i spent an entire lifetime there im drawn backwards again spectrums falling into each other just enough time to hear the next heartbeat boom boom and be blasted off again

im not sure if youre keeping count but i was thats only 3 heartbeats so far

at that third heartbeat the realization set in id just spent a life time in a second this was supposed to last up to 20 min i dont know how else to explain it but i died at that realization ego death i no longer existed as my reality was thrown back and forth between an endless inexistence in infinitely different realities and a single slow heartbeat over and over in between each heartbeat it felt like hundreds maybe thousands of times

at the end i caught a heartbeat in our universe i managed to hear a bird and used it to pull myself outid definitely seen enough for this session

back to reality
after hearing the bird i got most of my wits back i layed with my blindfold on for a few minutes then sat up and took off the blindfold

my arms and legs were convulsing decently but i wasnt worried about that the world around me was colored in rainbow fractals the plaid blanket i sat on was quite indescribable  fast forward about 5 minutes and the visuals die down slowly along with the convulsions

so in conclusion what did i learn
time is irrelevant if i can spend an eternity in a second what is a second"
17.44311,16.636156,Addicted,"my first ayahuasca experience
600 pm

a friend and i ingested 3g of syrian rue extract we patiently chilled on a couch while some other friends were playing video games we waited about an hour until we felt very high and relaxed indicative of the maoi contained within the rue taking effect 

700 pm

we sequestered ourselves in our friend’s bedroom just us and our sober guide we each laid down on a bed and ingested 50 mg of ultrapure freebase dmt two other friends were tripping nuts in the other room on some potent shroom tea 

730 pm

i begin to feel very heavy with waves of nausea it was very difficult to move and felt like i was becoming locked into my own body so much that it made me want to close my eyes at this point when i closed my eyes i would begin to see more light than i knew was actually there according to my guide my pupils at this point were incredibly dilated i felt like i needed to take a leak and i was about 10 feet from the bathroom it was incredibly difficult to walk there and by the time i walked back to the bed i said “i really do not want to move” so i laid back down and began to close my eyes 

745 pm

by this time i could feel something wanting to happen when i closed my eyes it felt like something was trying to embrace me i kept telling myself “let go i want more” little did i know this was the lesson i was going to eventually learn this is where things start to get a little weird it was so easy for me to think nothing at all my mind was completely free of clutter and if i tried to control it and think for myself i began to feel nauseous but this feeling of nausea wasn’t bad at all in fact i wanted it i started to think “man i fucked up” and i heard a voice saying “it’s ok” at this point i opened my eyes and heaved into a trash can i had near me nothing came up but the feeling of wanting to throw up was absolutely amazing every time i would do this i would hear “it’s ok” and if i did i felt amazing it was as if when i went to throw up i threw up all mental garbage i literally never threw up anything physical these waves persisted for a little while getting ever more intense each time “it’s ok” that is what he kept telling me and eventually i began to trust him i began to get a little scared of this but i didn’t want to tell him but little did i know i could hide nothing from him he was literally my subconscious mind my spirit he knew everything and boy did he not like it when i lied to him more on this soon 

759 pm

when i would open my eyes the hallucinations would be so powerful it almost hurt to look at them i would see everything turn into grand geometric patterns in an array of colors i had never seen before it became so intense that i had to close my eyes i told myself “this is too intense if i close my eyes i can ride it out” that was bullshit when i closed my eyes i entered the spirit realm i had no form i was in a forest of lights in the presence of him my spirit i tried to close my eyes harder but he told me “there is no such thing as an eye that is closed” at this point i knew the only way through the trip was directly through it i could not hide from it so i began to tell myself “let go” i looked him in the eye and said “take me i will let you drive” he responded with “i’m always driving but not yet” every time i tried to let him take me i would slowly come back to the real world open my eyes and the cycle continued the walls were flowing like rivers of cut jewels and they would morph into spectacular explosions of color the colors i saw were too much for me to handle and i would close my eyes again at this point i’m getting more and more terrified with each passing wave 

841 pm

841 pm is a very important time because this was the point in the trip where he truly showed me who was in control if i opened my eyes the hallucinations became so intense they hurt me everything evolved into a glorious explosion of colorful images i felt like my physical being could not bear witness to i felt like if i kept watching my eyes would burn a small tether of myself to reality was still there so i thought “maybe if i close my eyes i can just ride this out” every time i tried to close my eyes i would go back to the spirit world he would be standing there motionless with no words i couldn’t look directly at him it’s as if i was ashamed i felt like i was not supposed to be there and i was about to be punished so i opened my eyes again

841 pm

my first sight was the digital clock in front of me having never moved a second instantly my vision was filled with moving symmetrical patterns changing colors the whole way around i felt the same way like i was not supposed to see these images i can’t even possibly begin to describe what they were in fear i closed my eyes again and there he was having never moved an inch i still could not look at him i’m getting very scared so much that i feel my physical stomach want to vomit i began to tear up in his presence and he said again “it’s ok” i wanted to throw up mentally again i awoke and dry heaved into a trash can nothing came out physically however i felt a wave of emotions leave my body with each heave i laid back down and looked at the clock

841 pm

why was i stuck in this infinite time loop all i wanted was to come back to reality but he knew i was hiding something and refused to let me go “you wanted this” he told me “remember there is no such thing as a closed eye” i didn’t want this anymore i had taken several powerful psychedelics in my life but nothing came close to this this was impossible to “ride out” this cycle continued i tried to open my eyes but was blinded by the power of the visions i would close my eyes and try to figure a way out without looking at him i was losing control and i was scared for some reason i couldn’t yet look him in the eye i knew what he was doing he would not let time continue to pass until i looked at what he had to show me i literally felt like i was dying i closed my eyes once again and hoped i could just fall asleep but there i was – standing in his presence again and again i tried to look away but everywhere i looked he was there i could not hide from him i asked him “am i going to die” he responded with “well what is life” at this point i said “ok i don’t know if i want this anymore” he just smiled at me and said “now it’s time” at this point i began crying and fell to my knees “i’m scared” i told him “good” he said i opened my eyes one last time and saw the clock but only for an instant

841 pm

he embraced me and with his touch and i fell to pieces every part of my existence was in infinite shattered pieces on the ground made of light of a colors i still cannot perceive now this is where things got really intense i experienced complete ego death what is known as a level 5 psychedelic experience my entire being died at that moment i completely lost control and for a moment my thoughts perished there was no good no bad there was only everything and everything was there but at the same time there was nothing i know that sounds like a crazy drug induced experience i mean it was but that’s how it was once i completely let go of this world everything became peaceful i was neither here nor there happy nor sad

i became surrounded by an infinity of versions of him and i was having conversations with every one of them at the same time each one of them were going through every memory of my life at the same time i could remember being a baby held in my mother’s arms i could remember going to kindergarten i could remember every human encounter of my life every second of my life was being relived an infinite number of him took an infinite number of pieces of my existence like a shattered crystal when i looked into the crystal i began reliving the experience 

i asked him “what does this mean” he picked up a memory and i cannot remember what it was exactly but it was a very fond peaceful memory i think i was a little boy taking a walk with my mother or something something that felt amazing he said “do you like this one” i responded with “yes” he then gave me back that piece as if he was starting to put me back together he took a few more pieces that i liked and put them back then he took another piece this one was a memory of some fight or something i had with someone again i cannot remember what it was but it was not a pleasant memory he again asked “do you like this one” i said “no i don’t like this one” he smiled and with a flick of his hands the crystal vanished he looked me in the eye and said “do you understand now” now at this point no i did not understand and i was honest with him i said “i’m not sure” he smiled again and reached out to embrace me with a very gentle voice he says “look again” i opened my eyes for a split second and again the first image was of the digital clock in the room

842 pm

he did it i looked at what he had to show and in return he allowed time to pass i now knew that if i was honest with him everything would be ok i knew who he was a religious person which i am not would say it was god a hippie which i kind of am would say he was my spirit a scientist which i am would say he was my subconscious mind he was me he was the very essence of me he took no physical form and i knew he came out of me i could feel the wound on my body from where he was separated from me i knew i was not supposed to be in his presence at that time that he was never supposed to leave me but it was good that he did because after the fact i knew what he was telling me i was in his realm the realm of my being the one who controls my heartbeat my breathing he was the one telling the enzymes in my body to work my cells to grow and multiply he controlled everything he knew everything he was everything 

he continued putting pieces of me back together but he didn’t finish he stopped and i asked why he said “because you don’t need me to do this” he was me and i was him he knew because i knew i knew because he knew i understood for the first time he and i were one 

the past few years of my life have been lived in horrible depression i joined a graduate program for a degree i ultimately didn’t want and i let many people convince me to stay much longer than i wanted this led to a life i almost didn’t want to live i wanted to teach but i let this program try to change me into a researcher i never wanted that he never wanted that we never wanted that i was depressed not because of anything anyone else did i was not depressed because of anything but the fact that i became separated from him he deep down always knew i was on the wrong path from the moment we started but i continued he never fought back he never fought back because he is better than me my body is a vehicle and i thought i was driving come to find out i am just a passenger he is the driver and he always has been the driver sometimes in my life i try to be cocky and grab the wheel from the passenger side he doesn’t fight back he allows me to steer us in a new direction without fighting back instead he says nothing he does nothing just like when i was stuck in the time loop if i didn’t surrender to him i was stuck i was in hell i was in nonexistence that is what hell is when you become completely separated from your soul from the one driving 

ayahuasca is not about the physical visions it’s about what you feel what you “see” but not with your eyes as the trip continued i became happier and more at peace with each passing wave i had yet to open my eyes yet at point i was ready for what he wanted to show me i gave him complete control and it was amazing out of nowhere he appears again this time there is only one of him he is looking me in the eyes and this time we are both smiling he went to embrace me and this time i went to embrace him and when i did his final words to me were “it’s ok it will always be ok” his being began to seep back into mine and in an instant my eyes opened

930 pm

i jumped out of bed and noticed the hallucinations stopped i was drenched in sweat but i was sober i felt like i just awoke from an incredible powernap my guide said my eyes were completely black i had no iris left because my pupils were so dilated i immediately looked in the mirror and i saw him in my reflection he gave me a comforting smirk that i normally give people and he winked at me my soul and i are in tune again i felt so at peace i just wanted to tell everyone so i began writing down every piece i could remember still to this day when i look in the mirror i’m happy because i see him and he sees me and we like each other again he always liked me i can’t say the same for me that’s why he is better than me if i continue to follow my heart and listen to him everything will be ok i know that now"
19.373495,12.4365225,Addicted,"first mushroom psychedelic experience 25g mushshrooms
some background info i bought a quarter of shrooms before the start of school this year because my friend p and i had been thinking about trying psychedelics p our other friend r and i all smoked weed occasionally last year but r didnt think it was the greatest idea to try any other drug besides weed and alcohol i had been talking to p and it seemed like he definitely wanted to eat the shrooms with me and r also said that he might consider it we all arrived at school and when we got to rs room i asked them if they wanted to eat the shrooms they both said no which bummed me out a bit but i felt that i was ready for the experience and really wanted to try them that day so i ate about 25g from the quarter that i had

the trip after ingesting the shrooms at 6pm we stuck around in rs room for around 30 minutes and we decided to go meet some friends and walk around campus as i walked outside i wasnt experiencing any intense visuals but the world around me seemed more vibrant and exceedingly beautiful i let out a cry of joy and expressed to p r and the rest of our friends how beautiful everything looked as we walked through campus i didnt experience any other visualsfeelings but i ran into another acquaintance of mine which i had last seen when i had taken mdma during the summer i made a comment to r that i thought it was odd that both the last two times i had seen this acquaintance i had been on some sort of drug r told me that maybe that meant im doing drugs too often at the time i brushed his comment off but later on in the trip it would come back to haunt me we saw a sign for free tea in one of the university buildings so we stopped walking to decide if we wanted to go inside this was the first time we stopped walking since we left rs room and i finally started to experience some intense visuals i looked at the brick wall of one of the university buildings and the mortar in between the bricks was flowing like a river while the lines between all of the bricks were waving back and forth i sat looking at the wall for a few minutes lost within the intricate designs that were revealing themselves before me and then p and r told me to come inside so we could all get tea together

 i would guess it had been around 15 hours since i had taken the shrooms at this point and i was having strong visuals ps girlfriend  h had joined us a few minutes before and i decided i didnt want to talk to anyone who i didnt know so p and r went to get tea while i stayed with h h asked me to describe to her what i was experiencing and i started talking about how i could see the lines in between the tiles flowing like rivers and the texture of the tile flowing together like waves by the time i started describing this to her though completely new visuals had already sprung up such as the floor breathing along with me and the colors of the tiles changing as we were waiting for p and r to come back a guy i met once the year before came up to me and started talking to me i could barely keep eye contact because whenever he moved his face i would see trails and it would look like he had 4 or even more eyes his face was bulging in and out and it was extremely disconcerting the amount of detail that i could see thankfully p and r returned soon and we left the building h wanted to go to a restaurant so we decided we would go to this authentic chinese restaurant nearby as we walked from the university building to the restaurant the ground around the breathes kept breathing and i remember thinking how fitting it was that the ground was breathing since trees are in the ground and they are also breathing

when we arrived the waitress seemed very rushed and in a bad mood and for the rest of the meal i kept wondering whether she was a student at the university or if all she did was work at this restaurant two more of hs friends came to the restaurant as well as my friend d d knew i had eaten the shrooms but hs two friends didnt so i asked r to tell h to tell her friends that i was tripping it seemed necessary that i tell them and i thought this was the best way once everyone knew that i was tripping i felt a lot more comfortable and we all decided what we wanted to order r and i ordered some type of chicken dish and when it arrived we were all given chopsticks to eat with i cant use chopsticks when im sober and it was extremely difficult for me to pick up any food since the chopsticks kept changing in length i decided to not eat anything and instead look at all of the designs that were around me the chopsticks were metal and they had dragons carved into them that seemed to be moving and ready to burst out i moved my gaze to the table where there was a smudge that was in the shape of a monkey i would move the smudge around with my fingers and play with the monkey i entertained myself for the duration of the meal by doing this and listening to the conversations that were going on 

we left the restaurant and headed to hs friends house hs friend said how awesome it would be if we could all smoke so i told him that i had some weed that he could roll and smoke if he wanted but that i didnt want to smoke hs friend and r went to smoke outside while h d p and i stayed inside i brought some glowsticks and bubbles from home and i played with them while i waited for everyone to come back inside the bubbles of air within the glowsticks were incredibly smooth and mesmerizing and both the glowsticks and bubbles created trails that were multiple inches long when i moved them around i asked p if he still wanted to try dmt with me in the future and he said in a mocking tone that only if we injected it i told him that you couldnt inject dmt which is wrong i later learned and asked him why he had changed his mind about psychedelics i guess p had decided against doing any psychedelics because h disapproved p and r are both in the same fraternity and they had to go set up a party so we left h and her friends while p r d and i went back to ps apartment 

i was left alone in ps apartment since p and r had to go set up a party and ds friend needed him to go be his wingman the guy i had bought the shrooms highly recommended that i listen to music during my trip so i pulled out my headphones and started listening to bachs st john passion im not sure if it was the dark mood of the music or something else but i was completely put off by the sound coming from my headphones it didnt sound real enough to me i went into ps room and decided to lie down on his bed and just think i started thinking about what it really means to be alive what the point of humanity is and i came to the conclusion that our whole existence is absurd i saw myself being taken away by police and put in jail for life for the rest of the shrooms that i had on me i saw myself being eaten by a cheetah and left to die in the desert and then i saw myself floating in space within view of the earth i felt completely worthless at this point i kept thinking back to what the guy that sold me the shrooms had told me that some people have suicidal thoughts on shrooms it was constantly in the back of my mind and i was desperately scrambling to try to find some meaning to my life so that i wouldnt have to kill myself due to the futility of it all i thought back to my friends they had all left me alone they dont care about me i thought then i thought about my family my dad cared about me more than anything else in the world but i realized that even if i died before he did he would also die eventually and his pain would also disappear my mind was completely dark now and from somewhere inside i sensed a light shining brighter and brighter i realized that it was my sister my best friend in the entire world she knew that i smoked weed and drank but she didnt like it at all if she knew that i had tried psychedelics she would be heartbroken i disagree with her that psychedelics are bad though i decided that the meaning of my life was to ensure her happiness because she was the most important person to me to ensure her happiness i would have to stop doing drugs so i could be the perfect rolemodel that i had always been i started envisioning cliche and dramatic versions of me throwing the rest of my shrooms and weed down a river while holding hands with all of my friends but then i thought back to what r had said about me doing too many drugs lately thinking that i had found my purpose in life i immediately went to the toilet and flushed the rest of my weed and shrooms down the toilet i felt liberated and reborn d came back and i talked to him for a while about my new decision to not do drugs anymore we went to grab some food since my appetite was coming back now that i had passed the peak of my trip we talked for a while about life and then i went back to my apartment to sleep 

looking back on the trip for the few days after the trip i tried to make sense of everything that had occurred and i realized that the meaning of my life was not to ensure my sisters complete happiness and that even if she didnt like me doing drugs i enjoy it very much i decided that my new philosophy of life would be to maximize my own pleasure while minimizing others discomfort the existentialist thoughts i had during the trip about life being an absurd and meaningless thing are still with me now and i have decided to do some reading to try to find meaning 

i see more beauty in every day life now and in situations that would have bored me to death before i just start contemplating life and endlessly entertain myself i doubt i will ever find absolute meaning in life but for now i am content with being happy and making others happy as well "

hey everyone i recently started writing out my trips and i tend to write in a more storytelling fashion so sorry its so long i really enjoyed writing this though let me know if you guys want more

note all names have been changed bc id rather not post my friends actual names and i doubt they would either
edit sorry for the wall of text i have it spaced out in paragraphs but they dont stay after i click save

 the day started out more or less the same as any other it was the friday of spring break senior year i had very recently been busted again for smoking weed this was a big bust for my parents they found the gold mine they got everything lighters weed bowl grinder my friends bong… it was not a pretty sight as my dad broke everything one by one that was four days before this but we already had plans to do this and we weren’t going to back out through simple bullshit like that what we had was a large amount of lsd that was not going to waste i had only done it twice before so i thought hey why not just try three tabs at once yeah 
	
basically it went like this rob and i both took three john took two and peter took one john had an empty house for the entire break so we made our “home base” there we finally all met up around 2 pm and popped them in our trip sitter logan wanted to go smoke a little weed so we chilled and talked outside with him while he sparked up out of his elephant bubbler we all smoke a lot except rob so it’s not like he was the only stoner there but we all decided to skip the weed on the come up 

the excitement of popping the tabs quickly wore off as the “what now” feeling set in that i always get while waiting for the acid to take over in a brilliant stroke of genius we decided to pile in the car and head for menards yeah you read that right but hear me out  rob had brought some albanese gummy bears and while we were in the car initially headed for walgreens he shared some with us and after we converted everyone in the car to the church of albanese rob told us that they sometimes sell them at menards so there you go

	
about halfway to menards we’re all talking and listening to music when we started to feel the come up beginning i remember thinking to myself “fuck it here we go” when we got out of the car we headed inside and immediately my anxiety levels jumped not to unhandleable levels mind you but more of a “okay fuck i’m coming up on a shit load of acid in a public building” almost instantly john and i lost everyone in a roughly minute long search that was stretched to an hour we found them near the candy duh but there was one problem  the distinct lack of albanese 

	
of course instead of leaving the store like normal people we all immediately jumped to the conclusion that we had to leave with something otherwise it’d look like we stole something so we all individually buy a giant bag of gummy lifesavers in retrospect it probably looked weirder for us to all buy that than if we left with nothing at all but thats beside the point when we made it back outside it had started to lightly rain so we ran across the parking lot to get to the car once the last door slammed i remember a deafening silence rang in my ears after a minute we all burst out laughing “did we just fucking do that” “what the fuck” “that was so dumb” we were saying to each other
	
and that was just the come up

	
we continued to drive around for a little enjoying the come up listening to music watching the rain fall and just hanging out it was nice then we decided we had killed enough time and it was time for the main event  laser tag this was not our smartest decision but our reasoning was “but man how awesome would it be to say that we went laser tagging on acid” as flawed as that reasoning may be i’d say it was worth it because hey  i went laser tagging on acid


we pulled into the parking lot and the jaunty happiness that was inside the car quickly dissipated as logan parked he turned off the car and an audible collective breath could be heard i don’t know who said it but someone asked “so are we good” after a few more breaths we came to the conclusion that yes we were good we hopped out of the car and headed for the door and immediately passed it and went into the alley behind it because we all got incredibly nervous writing this it seems hilarious that a group of 18 year old dudes had to collect themselves in the back alley outside of a shitty laser tag arena 



eventually we got our act together and headed inside and this is where i have to give a major shout out to logan as you’ll see logan with his logan magictm somehow got us through everything and we hailed him as a prophet he told us to chill out on the benches as he went to talk to the lady at the desk he came back to find us staring at the tile floor complete with trippy designs as well as led lights running across the ground in every direction as per laser tag standards this is when i started to hallucinate the ground itself looked like it was warping as the lights danced over and under different parts of the floor logan pulled us out of the trance telling us the next game was in 15 minutes 


of course 15 minutes in lucy time is an incredible patch of time and in that time we just sat there tripping in a laser tag lobby area my mom texted me and i was able to reply like a normal human being astonishingly and with logan double checking my texts i was able to navigate through the conversation scot free at one point we had to go up to the lady at the front desk and tell her what we wanted our names to be for the game i chose “sly” and felt so out of place standing on the little block to reach the desk saying sly in a serious voice to the lady finally our time came and we were directed into the pregame room it was covered in dark lights completely fucking with my vision and as the underpaid game supervisor went over the rules logan just kept making me crack up when it came time to take the “oath” that you would play fair logan would repeat the opposite of what she said back to her which was a fairly mundane joke but i was losing my shit 


i had one more encounter with staff as i had put the vest on backwards but then we were thrown into the jungle lasers flew everywhere and after a brief “uh what now” moment we headed off into the unknown i immediately lost almost everyone besides logan and he guided me through telling me we were on a secret mission in ‘nam i really started to get into it it was really fun and took a lot of anxiety away to play pretend we’d run from cover to cover shooting anything that moved we’d fall over when we got shot and the other would have to help him up we eventually found peter and john who were just slowly walking around staring at the walls and it was at this point that i remembered that i was on an insane amount of drugs 


i remembered that i wanted to try something and i put my earbuds in and just hit play “let it happen” by tame impala came on and it took me over i ran away from my friends letting the music take me wherever it wanted to i shot ducked and dove through the dark smoke until i ran into logan again taking out an earbud i simply said “leave me” and ran the other direction i felt consumed like i was in apocalypse now and the forest was taking me i set up shop in a tower shooting anyone that tried to come up and raining hell on everyone below eventually i realized that my gun wasn’t firing anymore and then logan tapped me on the shoulder and told me the game was over he hadn’t even left my side i don’t think


after a lengthy battle of getting my earbuds untangled from the other wires on the gun and vest we headed out as we came back outside we all remarked about how nice it was to be back outside and its so amazing outside except it wasn’t it was freezing raining and overcast again we ran to the car and as the last door slammed closed a moment of silence was followed by a well deserved laugh “we fucking laser tagged on acid” “why” “because we can” i remember people saying and one of them might have been me with spirits higher than ever we started up the car and headed out recounting our war stories rob hadn’t been sighted the entire match and didn’t divulge much and he told me later his trip was not a great one which sucks as we were driving the raindrops slowly rolled along the windows as the setting sun hit them providing us with an amazing view as my trip continued to intensify


i can actually pinpoint the moment that my trip jumped up another final notch i was talking to john and rob and john pointed to my hat i looked at it and my eyes widened in disbelief the patterns depiction of moose and colors they were all moving independently of the hat they were sewed onto and their colors were amazing to say the least we were losing it about how magical that was for us and how all it was was us brushing up against sweaty puerto ricans with pokemon hats and how when we crossed the bridge back into park ridge it was like a bridge from average middle class minorities to upper middle class whites and just how hilarious that fact was i hung my head out of the car as the rain slowed letting the cool wind wash over me it really was an incredible time


we pulled up to johns house and as i got out i was talking to logan and peter about how what i was experiencing right now was quintessential lsd i remember saying “one tab is fun two tabs is amazing three tabs this shit is acid” we were able to finally relax when we came back in and this is when my mind opened wide fucking open i was in full on “revelation” mode convinced everyone in the house were prophets and that i had figured “it” all out i disavowed capitalism and the two party system and realized i wanted to create something for a living that is actually true and i still believe i was meant to create to this day 


though this is where the majority of the trip took place nothing really of importance took place we talked and talked and talked we were talking about life how to be happy what it means to be successful and stuff like that eventually we ordered a pizza and by that i mean logan ordered us a pizza when it came we barely ate any of it and realized we all just really liked the idea of pizza but none of us were really hungry as the sun set i felt my anxiety start to rise and rob and i took a walk to clear our minds we were both getting some bad vibes for some reason and we went to a park and did a couple laps around it and that really helped me at about 10 a few other people came over who i was not terribly familiar with at the time and wasn’t really digging it rob left shortly after followed by logan peter and i i got back around 1045 definitely still tripping i talked to both of my parents about it and my brother came into the computer room where i was at asking me what the hell i was doing home he knew i had taken the acid he also said my pupils were still insanely huge i chuckled to myself for a while after that i couldn’t believe i did all that it was incredible and here i was winding down the day with a nice matimi0 stream watching him play rainbow 6 whenever he held still in game though i would still see doorframes wobbling sights not lining up and other little things to remind me that yes i was still tripping i went to “bed” around one because i had work the next day but i couldn’t sleep i was still getting close eyed hallucinations and i just tossed and turned my way to morning and headed into work i told germaine how crazy of a day i had he’s my shift leader but we talk about drugs a lot so he told me i could take it easy today i spent my time at work just reliving my recent ever fading memory of yesterday 1210 would do again and i will

 1000 mcg trip  what could possibly go wrong

original appears hereurlmcglsdtrip  includes some images etc

the come up

my friends had varying experience with lsd  1 friend who will be called john had tripped a total of seven or so times another dave a single time actually 2 days before this trip and the other kelly was dropping for the first time for her birthday

the day seemed all too perfect for anything to mess up despite the fact that during this time in my life i had had a myriad of personal issues and insecurities that could possibly lead to bad experiences  


im starting to get slightly uneasy even thinking about the experience i am about to describe  


around 330 pm my friend kelly picked me up from my house dave was also in the car we drove to another friends house where my personal stash of acid was sitting in the freezer the lsd was dropped onto sugar cubes our plan was to drive to our friend yet another friends house and enjoy the ride in a safe setting

i walked into his house and saw a couple of my friends there we briefly conversed and smoked a bowl of topquality cbdrich sativa marijuana an antipsychotic chemical in marijuana that reduces anxiety for a few minutes as a way to ease me into my trip

i pulled a whopping seven sugar cubes out of the freezer and shoved them in my mouth then licked a bunch of sugar crumbles off the foil which came from the edges of the 15 sugar cubes i had in my stash this was a total of around 1000 micrograms

my friends were a bit shocked i was willing to go that far but they already were aware of my tendency to consume large quantities of psychedelic drugs i talked with them for another 10 minutes or so then i went back to the car on my way to the car i noticed i was starting to feel increasingly disoriented it wasnt that euphoric confusing sort of disorientation it was more of a im losing fucking my mind sort of thing i felt slightly anxious but i assumed the negative feelings would pass as soon as the acid took full effect a couple minutes after i got in the car dave ate 2 sugar cubes and kelly ate 1  


the experience was about to get very very ugly  


to give you guys a little perspective on the unfathomable effects of 1000 mic doses here is a quote from the nobel prize winning chemist kary mullis that ingested 1000 micrograms for his first dose   


when you take 1000 micrograms of lsd you dont know youve taken anything it just feels like thats the way it is you might suddenly find yourself sitting on a building in egypt three thousand years ago watching boats on the nile  


yes it is that fucking crazy  


ten minutes into the car ride and twenty minutes after eating the sugar cubes i was rapidly losing all touch with reality i started wondering what the fuck was going on around me and why i was feeling so uncomfortable i started telling my friends i was really scared and the intense anxiety was gripping every single fiber of my body i thought i was going die and that this trip was going to last until the end of eternity by the minute i was starting to panic more this was only the beginning of an unimaginable nightmare that would show me the dark side of lsd and completely change my opinion about the drug in general

📷

it hits hard   


25 minutes after taking the sugar cubes we arrived at jacs house by that time i was stumbling all over the place and i was already having severe visual distortion all movements were followed by strobing trails composed of detailed patterns kaleidoscopes and rainbows these visuals that i would have usually considered beautiful were now viewed as a reminder that i was in the middle of a trip that i so desperately wanted to end   


when i got inside his house i saw a few more of my friends sitting on the couch my body temperature had elevated to the point i thought i was burning alive i was completely out of my body and almost felt like i was on a high dose of ketamine i felt embarrassed because i obviously looked like i couldnt handle my shit maybe this was just an extreme amplification of my general selfesteem issues their faces were assuming demonic forms i fled to jacs room i was already starting to experience ego loss i was going in and out of consciousness  


this is the point where i lost track of time so there is no point of trying to estimate anything  


jac followed me to his room and did his best to comfort me and talk me out of my bad trip it was a completely ineffective attempt a couple minutes later i started crying hysterically everything was getting darker i fell into the most depressive state of my life combined with the most acute sense of panic ive ever experienced the floor was covered in spiraling kaleidoscopes that were rapidly shifting colors i heard thousands of voices call me names like pussy and bitch the room wreaked of sewage and feces this was the most negative emotion a human being could ever fathom i so desperately wanted to stop the trip but i was immobilized and unable to move

📷

i realized that the voices were of all of the people i resented in my life the most cartoon blood was all over the ceiling and the walls my vision seemed to stretch off into infinity i was hallucinating so much i couldnt fucking believe it i could see many different events of my life playing out as if it was waking reality try and imagine being inside of a saw movie first hand but a thousand times more horrifying and traumatic there was a moment in which my mind would shoot out of my body two feet in front of me and then return into my body and this looped over and over again for what felt like forever at an impossible speed time was nonexistent and a second felt like forever not hours not days but an infinite amount of time   


i kept hearing this bizarre futuristic noise that sounded like a computer glitching the whole room was flashing as if something was flicking the on switch for a lamp up and down repeatedly my jaw was rapidly vibrating like i had taken 300 mg of mdma i always get major jaw clenching from acid i had fullblown synaethsia everything was one everything was infinitely interconnected i would look at the walls and become the walls i would look at the floor and then become the floor looking back at my body in a dissociative fashion i was unable to differentiate any part of the outside world from my own physical body the concept of i was now a mere construct of my mind and i was nothing more than a complex bundle of atoms and molecules   


somehow just a little while after this part of the trip i regained some degree of consciousness i stumbled to his backyard where a group of 8 or so people were sitting and i was watching the sky and everything in my external environment turning black and red i could barely see anything my vision was almost completely shot i forget that i even had a body at this point and i had absolutely no control over my muscular movements i was in this survival mode where my mind was on autopilot and and i had no idea that i was on drugs i lost balance and fell backward onto the ground i continued to see more incredible vortexes of matrix style numbers and letters spurt out from every direction   


during my friends attempts to help restore me to sanity they asked if i knew what time it was i responded with 800 am when it was late in the afternoon that was quite enough of a response to prove i was completely and utterly going nuts and there was no real way to help me   


once night fell i was fullon peaking in jacs room i began to literally have no idea who i was where i was or what drug i was on or what drugs were in the first place i knew that i was going to die and nothing could be done to stop it at some point at the beginning of the peak i realized that i could not recognize the room i was in suddenly i started seeing several cop cars pull into the room and put their sirens on yellow caution tape magically appeared around them as well this was one of my worst nightmares coming to life before my very eyes there was a line of alreadyarrested criminals in handcuffs next to the cop cars and they were all complaining that i had snitched on them for some unspecified reason i knew i was in for absolute hell before i could see what was going to happen next everything started fading to white i could see nothing but burning white light like i was looking directly at the sun from 100 feet away what i saw wasthe ultimate truth the answer to every question the reason reality is the way that it is i existed within the past present and future simultaneously i couldnt see my own hand in front of my face i dissolved into infinity i was existing in an infinite number of dimensions living an infinite number of lives simultaneously for an infinite amount time though my memory of this is hazy i believe i relived every event of my entire life during the peak i could fit our entire universe into a period at the end of a sentence time was a point of nothingness i was everything yet i was nothing i was in pure ecstasy i felt the unconditional love of the universe penetrating every pore of my body if only this could have lasted forever i suppose this was a taste of the beautiful part of ego death but my stay in this ineffable place was cut short when i was suddenly catapulted into hyperspace where i experienced every ounce of pain any human being could ever possibly experience at one time the love rapidly shifted to evil in its purest definition i saw many miserable people i had seen throughout my life including the homeless and starving my brains sensory filter was gone every last bit of information that could physically be processed at once was flowing through my head at light speed   


i was dropped out of hyperspace directly into a hallucinatory prison facility i saw hundreds of pitbulls white supremacists and naked black men running around it was a state of sheer pandemonium i have never been so unbelievably horrified in my entire life i was now sure that this is where i would die i was taken to the showers where i was bitten repeatedly by pitbulls and raped by the white supremacists and black men simultaneously i was sobbing hysterically screaming for it stop it was physical and emotional torture beyond your wildest dreams i felt every single sensation including their penises in my anus and the razorsharp teeth of the vicious dogs   


who knows how long this actually went on for but eventually this torture ended and i was back in jacs room i saw all of my friends faces covered in knife wounds and deep bleeding cuts puddles of blood were all over the room my joints were still in severe pain from the physical torture i had just experienced  


i looked at the clock and it read 900 pm or something along those lines   


minutes after i came back to earth i realized that the purpose for human existence was to love love is our higher purpose i now understood that the ego i had developed my entire life was an illusion all along our egos push us away from our ability to feel compassion towards others as your ego fades away you slowly dissolve into pure unadulterated love the illusion of separation created by our egos has been the root cause of suffering all across our planet and sadly this is the reason the majority of the world kills each other for absurd purposes like religion and resources religions like christianity hide behind the idea that there is an afterlife because they are afraid of death there is nothing to fear because when you die there is no “you” to fear anything the only thing that separates us from other forms of life is our ability to think our ego is composed of our thoughts when we stop relying on our ego we cannot experience negative emotions when we stop thinking our ego ceases to exist and then we can live a life of pure love peace and prosperity the more we rely on our ego the more we push ourselves away from the moment which is all nothing outside the moment we are in right now will ever exist yesterday never is and tomorrow will never be time is infinite the past present and future are all occurring simultaneously we are merely observers free will is an illusion   


this was by far the most profound experience of my entire life  


i quickly forgot all of these things within 15 minutes of the peak ending i didnt fully understand the lessons i learned for until months had passed after the trip  


the next day

the next day was easily the worst day of my life excluding the trip i felt so selfconscious about myself that suicide was all i could think about i was thoroughly convinced that i had ruined my life permanently during ego death i became aware of the severity of my many mental disorders i realized that throughout my entire life i had been looked down upon as the special kid i had not been aware of this until that moment i felt like the most inferior form of life on the face of the earth   


after i got home i burst into tears i even thought my family felt sorry for me and had pitied me my whole life because they thought i was a moron   


i had a psychotic break for weeks afterward this was easily the most traumatic thing i have ever gone through in my entire life and has left a lasting mark on me that i carry to this day its been over 6 months now and i think about this trip every day of my life its nothing any human being ever deserves to go through and i would never wish it on my worst enemy   


over time this trip has had a profound impact on all areas of my life in both positive and negative ways  


positive i have very close friends now and rather than the special kid many people now view me as a very insightful and intelligent person before this experience i had very very few friends i wasnt close friends with the ones mentioned in this report but we chilled every once in a while i now know what true friendship is i meet new people all the time i suspect i used to have a mild form of autism and this trip literally eradicated it my entire family has mentioned multiple times that im a transformed person i have fully developed social skills i truly believe lsd is able to cure mental disorders and the scientific community needs to conduct research on this i act normally now i view everyone i meet as a part of my own consciousness which lets me act much more empathetically ive earned excellent grades at my community college and have grown tremendously  multiple people have commented that im an entirely different person ive taken up buddhism and adopted a very spiritual lifestyle   


negative several months ago i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder i suspect i was already predisposed to this condition and the trip brought it out i still have mental flashbacks nearly every day and have been scarred by experience i frequently have nightmares about this trip my thoughts can be very scattered and clouded at times my thinking is very impaired on some days but its very sporadic ive learned how fucked up our world is and sometimes i feel that ignorance is bliss our society disgusts me i think that the human race is a joke  


i am going say one thing do not take a high dose of acid unless you have a proper set and setting or it can turn into the worst nightmare of your entire life 300 micrograms is more than enough to have a spiritual experience 1000 micrograms does not provide a neardeath experience it provides a beyonddeath experience   


heed my warning don’t make the mistakes i did you are not invincible lsd is a seriously powerful drug and it has the ability to fuck you like nothing you could ever conceive of in fact after this experience i firmly believe it is the most powerful drug known to the human race ive smoked 150 mgapprox of dmt at once 7 consecutive enormous hits and the intensity could not come close to what i described in this trip report

19.618795,-7.6656036,Addicted,"sex on shrooms
i have tripped a lot in my life generally with a romantic partner and have often contemplated having sex during the trips but until recently have been unsuccessful  it is as though arousal is a strange and inaccessible state when so much else is going on in our minds not to mention that sex often seems like it would take a lot of effort and coordination that we dont quite possess while having our minds blown by the psychedelics

recently though my boyfriend and i took approximately 3g each of shrooms for about the first couple of hours of our trip we enjoyed drawing watching music videos and laughing with abandon as we usually do then we decided it was time for a change of scenery and went to the bedroom unlike a previous occasion on which we decided to have sex during a trip it happened completely naturally without conscious prompting somehow our shared trip culminated into a beautiful blossoming new state of arousal

while we had sex my closed eye visuals were of amazing colours and patterns that morphed and grew and expanded and deepened it was as if i could feel the way the oxytocin and dopamine of the sex affected the psilocybin how they danced together in my brain  much more intense than the closed eye visuals i had before we started having sex at one point a recurring image of two snakes wrapped tightly around eachother played in my mind i felt as if we were those snakes and it was beautiful i felt so completely connected so primal i felt like we were animals perfectly expressing the natural order of the universe and ecosystem that this was love and the purest most beautiful intense blissful expression of it somehow i was introspecting about sex and our love and fully immersed in the moment simultaneously it felt like it was beyond sex or even lovemaking it felt practically spiritual it was truly amazing and absolutely unforgettable if you find yourself in the right state of mind with the right person during a mushroom trip i would definitely say that having sex in the midst of it is an awesome experience"
16.469868,4.0952077,Addicted,"my 10 day benzo binge
normally i would call myself a responsible drug user i smoked cannabis habitually for a while and took other stuff maybe once or twice a month particularly psychedelics i love pharmacology and biochemistry and study it in my free time sometimes i like to try new substances  some i like some i dont but i never got into a habit of doing stuff every day i had received random btc and shopped around i had tried most classes of substances already except opiates and benzos opiates i have too much respect for right now psychedelics are starting to get a bit boring so i went ahead and got 20x2mg clonazepam from a really nice vendor i received 30 gotta love the people out there

i feel like a warning is in order because this whole story shows a lot of reckless and stupid behavior do not do this under any circumstance it was stupid and a huge waste i fully expect haters to hate people to laugh at me and thats okay i regret it for health reasons but it was a fuckload of fun yet not something i repeat on doing ever again i dont believe i was in any physical danger during any of this and i never felt any bad physical side symptoms but feel free to correct me on that

its a long text so bear with me most of this was written on the go while under the influence but edited multiple times for spelling and clarity i would enjoy if you read the entirety of it theres some passages that show interesting psychological tendencies in my opinion and its a pretty raw report without much fluff 

for the tldr people i recommend day 1 89 and 10

the grand total

 60mg clonazepam 1 kpin  2mg clonazepam
 110mg of 2cc about half oralhalf nasal  ouch
 200300ug lsd 4x 6080ug blotter
 1700mg of about 6070 pure mdma 70 of that insufflated because im a fucking fiend when it comes to snorting stuff the rest eaten
 spilled 15g of that mdma somewhere or whatever i dont know
 maybe 8g of varying quality weed who the fuck weights weed
 2 bottles of wine
 around 30 cups of coffee
 10g of vitamin c
 over a gram of 5htp
 60g of tobacco thats 15 packs or i dont know 120 cigs

day 1  thursday  8mg clonazepam 1g of cannabis 20mg of 2cc 120mg mdma

1830 i had no idea of the potency of the kpins so i took 1mg i felt this was a reasonable dose to test the strength of the material 

1930 not feeling much i probably underestimated how long they take to kick in so i took another 1mg

1945 feeling pretty good a bit woobly i decide to say fuck it and go out and to buy some weed the dealer gave me a funny look like are you okay i felt pretty sober so we parted ways

2040 i got back home smoked a joint and took annother 1mg in retrospect this is about the point where things were starting to get a bit out of control

2120 i proceeded to dance for a bit still feeling very good and smoked another joint

2220 after partying for a while i really liked the headspace and body high but it somehow lacked some psychedelia for my taste i dunno what i thought but i proceeded to insufflate 10mg of 2cc and took another 2mg clonazepam

2320 an hour later i threw up from the 2cc drip i had minor hallucinations but the 2cc wasnt all that great duh you took benzos you idiot i somehow managed to take videos of me during this i was dancing for half a minute then chilled out on the floor for a while then repeated this course of action endlessly

150 no memory of what i did the past 2 hours but my notes say i insuflatted another 10mg of 2cc without additional effects i guess a mix of dancing and chilling out i smoke a joint and take another 2mg clonazepam

230 somehow and this is really the point that presents my abolute stupidity during this whole binge i decide to insufflate 120mg of mdma this is also the point i might have accidently spilled about a gram of mdma somewhere i only recovered little pieces of it  sadfacejpg i fell asleep about 10 minutes later no mdma effects were noted at all and i didnt feel residual mdma aftereffects the following days i know 5ht release is stopped during rem and clonazepam affects sleeping patterns so maybe theres that

day 2  friday  6mg clonazepam 20mg 2cc more weed

1130 i think i woke up in some weird haze and make some coffee i took a 5htp and some vitamins 

1220 i make the clever choice to take another 2mg clonazepam i also decided insuflatting another 20mg of 2cc would help clear my mind right now and keep the party vibe going i actually made a video of me doing this but i have no recollection of what happened after that

1620 no clue what happened here i dont think the 2cc did much however more clonazepam seemed like a splendid idea i smoked a joint and passed out half an hour later on the floor

day 3  saturday  6mg clonazepam a little spliff

1100 i woke up and made some coffee physically i felt pretty ok i took more vitamins and 5htp i might have have taken more clonazepam there are some missing pills in my bag that i didnt write down around 4mg maybe

1245 i still wanted to party but i felt pretty sedated so i opted for another 180mg mdma something was really wrong with me by this point again i passed out 15 minutes later fortunetely i learnt the next day that i didnt actually take the mdma because it was still there on my table good on me i must have passed out before by now time is irrelevant the last 48h are a haze with no memories

day 4  sunday  6mg clonazepam another g of weed glass of wine

830 woke up feeling really good had some coffee again i cleaned the huge mess i made the days before there was drugs and shit all over the place and i forgot where i put everything  but it was the first time i actually felt lucid again i dont remember anything but small fragments from the last 3 days  i couldnt believe it was sunday already benzos make time go so fast its almost scary took a shower called my mum and had something to eat much love to the people in the rdrugs irc you guys are awesome 3 i have no idea what conversations i had during those days but i have very positive albeit extremly foggy memories

1130 yeah yeah another 2mg clonazepam

1300 i smoke a joint seriously i should have ended it here normally i would drop a couple tabs of acid smoke some weed on the comedown and be fine but this is starting to escalate 

1500 another 2mg clonazepam

1650 another joint i was starting to enjoy this again the combo is very chill and pleasurable

1800 another 2mg clonezpam im starting to notice a pattern here i smoke another joint and drink a small glass of wine i pass out soon later feeling quite fuzzy and good

day 5  monday  3mg clonazepam a g of weed a glass of wine

1000 i had to get up early because i had to go to work i still felt pretty benzod but it was managable it was more of a weed haze than benzo hangover i dont think anybody noticed my work performance sucked but i didnt give a shit

1400 i was stopped by a girl working for animal charity while in a subway station i normally dont like talking to these people but we had a really nice conversation i missed 3 trains because of her i think if i talked longer with her i would have invited her to dinner or something im feeling quite loved up and open to people which is on the unusual side for me and another thing why i enjoy the kpins so much i went to buy more weed on the way home

1430 i got home from work promplty decide to take another 2mg clonazepam and smoke another joint i decide i should take it easy on the kpins tonight probably the first clever decision in 4 days

1800 i drink 2 cups of coffee to not pass out decide to take another 1mg and say farewall to the kpins for now

2000 chilling out to some late night alumni and ishq really nice more weed was smoked

000 more weed and i pass out

day 6  tuesday  3mg clonazepam 40mg 2cc no weed today but another glass of wine

900 i woke up feeling quite hungover i already missed a dentist appointment but fuck the dentist anyway my teeth are fine it was suggested to not go cold turkey on the kpins so i opted for 05mg 2 cups of coffee a bunch of vitamins a snack a 5htp and went off to work

1500 i felt good the entire day work was a breeze time passed so fast i couldnt believe it i took another 05mg on my way home

1600 2 cups of coffee because why not i dont even normally drink more than a cup a day im seriously starting to think all these kpins are messing with me i start sipping on a glass of wine

1800 i finish more work related stuff which was greatly facilitated by the kpins again i could have ended it right here and by the time of writing this there were multiple occurences when this would have been the clever choice but my judgement of what was right and wrong was so far off  i just didnt give a shit

2000 alas i look for more drugs and i went with the 2cc again i know a lot of people kinda dislike 2cc because its very bland but i really dig this drug as a whole package duration and effects wise the first 10mg burnt like a motherfucker the 2nd 20mg were taken orally and of course i havent learnt from my first mistake and insuflatted another 10mg all of this within an hour or two i wish i had some weed today but i hadnt even planed on taking any more drugs when i woke up this morning by now i was just looking to get high in whatever way possible

2300 feeling quite good on the 2cc despite previous tolerance and kpins very chill and relaxing enjoying this a lot some cev that werent all that interesting i have a strong feeling i need to end this binge i didnt have work tomorrow so i stayed up until 2am gifted some btc to a random dude on irc took 2mg clonazepam and went to sleep"
18.550156,4.9250464,Addicted,"doing mdma for my first time alone
i posted to rdrugsurl last night asking for advise on rolling by myself everyone told me not to but i did it anyway and this is what it is was like

im 18 1575 lb and took a capsule of 150mg of pure mdma

0000  its 1115pm and i just dosed looking forward to whats to come

0030  30 minutes in staring to get a buzz my computer chair was becoming increasingly more comfortable and i was starting to feel really content

0050  music is really starting to sound good i remember trying to browse reddit but getting too distracted by the music crystal castles by the way so far im feeling great 

0100  took a shower i felt like i could have stayed in there all night it was amazing

0130  its been 90 minutes since i dosed and i think im starting to feel the full effects im in a really good mood i feel incredibly content and im just enjoying everything i gotta say though around this point i started thinking this is it this is the highly acclaimed mdma dont get me wrong i was enjoying it but i thought there would be more at this point i just kinda felt like i took adderall or something like that 

0230  still just kind of sitting around my room i was waiting for my mom to go to bed so i could go outside and smoke a bowl and she was taking her sweet time ive just been lying on my bed watching netflix while playing guitar still having a good time though

0315  my mom finally went to sleep so i went outside i smoked two bowls back to back and was feeling great i went on a walk around the block and thats when the effects of the mdma became a little more noticeable i remember feeling up but at the same time i was really relaxed when i was walking it kind of felt like i was floating or riding on a cloud like thisurl when i got back i smoked another bowl and went inside

0400  still feel like staying up but the weed has got me feeling more lazy i decide to just watch oddsac smoke another bowl and watch forest gump until i pass out 

0500  finished watching oddsac smoked another bowl ate something and crashed i really liked how it easy it was falling to sleep as opposed to the 2c products ive done 

overall i enjoyed it sure it probably wouldve been better if i did it with some friends while being out and about but it was still enjoyable by myself i have to say though it was a little underwhelming i might of just had my expectations too high but i definitely thought it was gonna be more extravagant than it turned out to be i probably could have even driven if i had to dont worry i dont ever plan on driving while on mdma 

this is totally something i want to do again i love the stimulated but relaxed feeling it gives you next time i do it i plan on doing 200mg and going out and doing something with some friends im glad i finally got to try mdma it may have been a little less than what i though it would be but it was still fun "
19.247654,15.9667015,Addicted,"meeting entity from past dmt trip while candyflipping
this is my first trip report so bare with me 

backstory
a few weeks ago me and my friend a were smoking changa for the first time ever so i take 3 pretty small hits from a homemade bong i start to feel dizzy so i put down the bong still filled with smoke my friend told me to empty the bong but when i was about to i got really intense hallucinations and decided to lie down instead 

dmt trip
when i closed my eyes i saw all these geometrical shapes moving in a certain way and felt the presence of atleast 2 counsiounesses one felt like male and as he had an attitude of look at this fool who think he can try to comprehend our world and one female who didnt really make a strong impression but felt very nurturing 

the male entity felt a bit hostile so i tried to remind myself that these trips are very short and i will soon be back to reality bam as soon as i had that thought he stopped time so i instead tried to accept everything that happened and it immediately got alot more fun the female was playing with the geometrical shapes creating spirals and such soon the trip started to fade and i felt her putting me down in my human body sort of like you would a baby in a crib 


candyflip  200 ug lsd 016g mdma total

weme and friend b and c were canoing to an island had a wonderful and bonding experience a while after the peak we decided to smoke weed and thats when none of us could keep the train of thought anymore we were talking alot but constantly forgot about what we brought a pretty large speaker with us and after a while i could see the music in the clouds i can best describe it as big geometrical shapes in the same colour as the clouds moving in rythm with the music then it changed to the wierdest short cartoon snippets alot of them were sucking each others dicks for reasons unknown to me at one point i picked up a small stickbranch and when i looked at it a mix between a puppet show and a flip note comic started playing looked back to the sky and saw a portal of shapes kind of those you see in animated dmt trips on youtube no more music in the sky just this portal so i decide i wanna walk around and look at stuff just to see what happens walk around for a while and look at all the funny shit happening eventually everything turns to a portal so i decide to keep looking at it even though it makes me dizzy 

after looking at the portal for a while it turns into the geometrical shapespatterns i recognize from my previous dmt trip it moves around in the sky for a while and touches a tree and the whole tree lights up with these shapespatterns in different colours i approach the tree and when i touch it i immediately realise its her the entity who was so kind to me during my dmt trip i put my arm around the tree and lean on it she misses me and want me to come visit her i think i stand there for a while but since the drugs are starting to ware off the logical part of my brain says hey youre standing here hugging a tree what are you doing i decide to say goodbye and not to mention this to my friends so they dont think ive lost itthey took a little less than me and were not too far from sober at this point 

so after this i decided im gonna smoke more changa and attempt a breakthrough but im going to wait a few daysweeks to let my mind rest  

can anyone relate to any of this entity on lsd shit "

the best day of my life 

102817 halloween weekend toronto canada three people myself included lsd 100ug 

wild electric surreal 

i have all the words to describe the visuals that i saw the sounds that i heard the orgasmic sensations that i felt reverberate from limb to limb but the experience is still so… beyond words adjectives do it no justice and even now i struggle to find the relevant logical and semantic interconnections of written language to even begin to describe what i believe with a passion to be the best day of my life 

it is nearly impossible to translate the psychedelic experience into biography my storytelling capacity is nowhere near commensurate to the adventures we had the emotions we felt the insights we garnered and the confounding yet simultaneously illuminating experience that a single tab of paper was able to precipitate in each of us but yet i remain incapable of ignoring the fact that what i experienced in that one night is in dire need of being shared so i’ll compromise enter the 28th of october 2017 

 buffalo new york it was the weekend after all my midterms and all my projects i’ve been planning this day for weeks with my friends the plan was to go to toronto with two friends d and j and have each of us take one tab of acid when we arrived we had a looselyplanned itinerary mainly some places and locations we wanted to visit but we wanted flexibility knowing full well that ultimately it was up to our visceral responses to dictate where we would eventually end up going anyways i mean i’ve taken acid before and i’ve tripped on shrooms with others but tripping on acid with others that was something completely new and little did i know that one night was going to be a whole lot of “new”

 400 pm d was our driver i sat shotgun j was in the back we were all huddled together in the center of the car on the drive to the hotel we booked in toronto we each took 1800mg of phenibut an hour before we left to help attenuate the comeup anxiety and override any feelings of negativity that might take over during the trip d was already down to trip – he’s done it with me before but j never tripped before he was interested in the idea of tripping but wasn’t fully certain yet i had two hours to convince him that the experience would be completely worth it i explained all the subjective effects on behavior visuals and headspace i gave him scientific evidence regarding the safety potential of lsd as well as harm reduction techniques set and setting posttrip supplementation proper hydration etc i gave him quotes spoken from great philosophers like alan watts to modern revolutionaries like steve jobs commending and advocating the lsd experience and after much of my impressive persuasion techniques… he still wasn’t convinced

 600pm – probably the only other reference time i can confidently share because things were about to get wild we arrived at the hotel unpacked and got comfortable none of our data plans were active except for d’s the driver – he paid for roaming and was essentially our only source of navigation and control i was the psychedelic mentor the tripsitter but we still had to follow him – otherwise we’d be completely lost without any way or connection to get back home i took out a strip of 5 tabs on one of the beds d and i looked at each other we grinned – we knew exactly what was about to go down we both popped a tab into our mouths chewed and then swallowed i tried once more to convince j that it was worth it the window of opportunity was running out i had to convince him if he took it too late our trips wouldn’t be in sync meaning that we wouldn’t be able to connect and help each other through the duration of our trips if he didn’t take it at all the group dynamic would’ve been awkward and uncomfortable sort of like when everyone in the room is high except for you and you feel alienated as a distant outgroup to everyone else i did a bit more of those seductive persuasion techniques i was talking about it worked 5 minutes later he took his tab i put the other 2 tabs away we were ready

 we left the hotel which was on the outskirts of the city and started driving towards the center of toronto… the entertainment district it was about an hour drive to our first destination sansotei ramen it had great yelp reviews and i mean who doesn’t love ramen exactly we were already playing music over the speakers at the time the phenibut was maximizing and sensitizing our music appreciation we were bumping to every song and definitely “felt” the individual aural details “save dat one for me” by the white panda was the song where we really felt the acid start to “click” into place you know that sensation you get when you try to swallow while tripping that dry insatiable foreign throat sensation you get we called it “cottonthroat” it was the marker that signified the steady transition from our sober phenibutinfused state into the psychedelic state we stepped from one realm to another foreign yet familiar one plane to another a smooth gradation yet identifiably strange and that was when we really started feeling the music volumes maxed out windows pulled down icy gales rushing into the heated interior of the car from all sides but no we didn’t care we felt invincible arms waving in undulating gestures that harmonized perfectly with the oscillating frequencies of the playlist i never felt such a profound connection to the edm rave genre dancing was automatic – the music would rush into my body and externalize itself energetically in the form of tantric motions and headnodding lights became brighter – each streetlight we sped past was surrounded with a rainbowtinted halo aura the external outlines of trees and structures were swelling and minimizing in the brisk wind we yelled exuberantly we couldn’t stop smiling nothing held us back the visuals complemented the audio which complemented the vibrations running up and down our bodies from our head to our toes everything complemented each other nothing needed to be changed everything was perfect

 eventually we arrived at the parking lot we stumbled out of the car still laughing and smiling walking seemed like such a foreign skill everything was hilarious we knew how difficult it would be to act normal in a public setting but even still we laughed at our plight none of it mattered we didn’t care about what others thought – this was our time we walked up the steps from the parking lot and came out of the ground to 7 glaring letters in colored sequence toronto immediately we asked some strangers to take photos of us next to the letters we felt like complete tourists but it was so perfect – our facial expressions the lighting the proportions… it was our first memoir of the trip 

 we started walking or trying to walk towards the ramen shop location and it was then that our headspace really started to change it was inevitable that we began to think about the deeper dynamics of social structure and interactions it was inevitable that we began to examine ourselves and develop insights about the way we acted and more so why we saw that the way we were walking was a lot more aggressive than the other people passing by it was when things clicked – there were intricacies in the dynamic differences between canadians and americans especially with us hailing from new york our walking stance and gait seemed unnecessarily belligerent – it was like we were going to war it seemed to point towards the stereotype that canadians were nice and new yorkers… well weren’t a couple times we had to remind ourselves to slow down our walking and “adjust” to the ambience we were now in another subtle reminder that canadians were much more relaxed and laidback and new yorkers tended to exude a much more hostile selfcentered and combative presence commonly associated with and engendered from the heavily calloused and unsympathetic atmosphere of the city

 we finally arrived at sansotei ramen we were on line for several minutes before we were finally seated all of us were deeply disconcerted with the vast options on the menu – there was so much that we wanted that we couldn’t formulate a decision eventually we all decided on what we wanted to order somehow and oddly enough we all ended up ordering the same thing – tonkotsu black coincidence or not it was quite a phenomenon to behold – the sensation was akin to feeling like we were all connected in one way or another in a tangible or cerebral context or both while waiting for the food we all spoke extremely loudly decibels above our normal speaking volumes what was interesting was that we weren’t actually speaking coherent sentences it was fragments of deconstructed sentences or random verbs and adjectives strung together but somehow just somehow we all spoke that same language

 our psychedeliainfused language we began to conjure up our own terms 

 the “surface world” referred to all the sober people around us or people who have never tripped on psychedelics before – they were wholly incapable of comprehending the sensations we felt the incomprehensible language we uttered and the concepts we shared but us three all understood each other we were all on the same plane 

 the concept of a “bubble” our group was akin to a bubble – we were all surrounded by an invisible semipermeable membrane our creative instincts and ideas would drift in between this bubble and combine and pervade the interior of the bubble everyone else had their own bubbles too when we felt like we were being too loud or annoying to other bubbles to the point where it could be deemed “disruptive” that’s when we knew we were projecting too much of our creative energy outwards and we needed to contain ourselves at the same time we needed to ensure that we didn’t completely contain and “silence” our own bubble – we didn’t want to repress all of our combined energy spontaneity and personality we understood the necessity of establishing an equilibrium and when two parties engaged in conversation that’s when they would mutually allow their permeable membranes to fuse albeit temporarily for an exchange of ideas opinions and personal impressions 

 an “encounter” was when denizens of the surface world would try to cross the soberpsychedelic plane to interact with us or vice versa both parties would meet halfway compromise and try to communicate in a semiintelligible hybrid language it was difficult for both sides – the english dialect was disparate from the psychedelic dialect and our conceptions of ideas were dimensions apart our first encounter was with one stranger in the ramen shop we found out he was a nighttime photographer university instructor and also had the connections to all the raving and clubbing events in toronto j and i had so much difficulty communicating with the waiter and the stranger that we resigned to simply looking at each other and quietly smiling we knew what was up we had to rely on d’s conversational skills to get us through that encounter as he was the most functional member out of all of us at that moment and we did end up getting the stranger’s contact information at the end of that encounter we all commended each other for a job well done functioning while tripping was… something else the meaning and structure of language seemed to fall apart social interactions were considerably more difficult concepts would break and restructure themselves within the recesses of our minds it wasn’t until later into the night that we were able to more fully regrasp our faculties 

 we visited graffiti alley an alleyway riddled with colorful spraypaint art the colors all worked so well with each other and the elements of the graffiti all came to life afterwards we decided to walk to peace and love a marijuana dispensary that sold weed without a medical prescription on the way there we had our first encounter with drama we felt two individuals following us out of the corner of my eye i saw them looking at each other and pointing at us they were definitely following us after a couple blocks i decided to pull us all over to the side and wait it out they kept walking and eventually just passed us by d j and i all discussed what just transpired when we ended up arriving at the dispensary afterwards we weren’t being paranoid the people following us most likely overheard our loud conversations about psychedelics and canadian culture as opposed to american culture – they saw three vulnerable teenagers that could have easily been taken advantage of robbed beaten or even worse i kept replaying that episode in my head – i was terrified but i had to regain my senses

 the dispensary was magical they checked our ids at the front to verify our ages and then motioned for us to enter a guarded entrance into a room filled with people and the aromas of wellcured bud never did i imagine myself visiting an underground dispensary to procure my own weed – it was always through friends dealers or other connections my friend d was on the line ordering and when he realized he didn’t know what to order confessed to the cashier that we were all tripping balls and needed a recommendation the cashier chuckled and knew exactly what our headspace demanded – he gave us 26 grams of the awardwinning super silver haze our second encounter

 it wasn’t until we left the shop that we realized we walked 40 minutes away from the parking spot on the walk back to the parking lot one store with vibrant candy colors and big couches and vr setups caught our eyes we entered to find a vr arcade where groups could rent out their own areas to play vr games with each other the experience was amazing being able to immerse myself into a visual reality environment while simultaneously tripping was an experience unlike any other – i felt like a kid again it was pure entertainment the instructor had to repeatedly teach us the controls – we were already struggling with functioning in true reality so augmented reality was just adding a layer of difficulty but even still we had so much fun even the instructor had fun conversing and joking around with us it was surreal we decided to leave after an hour of play and walked all the way back to the car 

 afterwards we did more driving and vibing the music was too good the audiovisual orgasms were constant and persistent we drove to a supermarket to pick up an apple and then drove to riverdale park – it had a nice grass lawn with a view overlooking the city structures of toronto we sat down on a tree trunk dug out the channels in the apple to make a bong and smoked the super silver haze that we bought earlier it was amazing smooth and delectable an organic high with a view of the entire toronto city and the lsd still coursing through our body we all felt completely satisfied perfection

 it was like we conquered the city we laughed and imagined our experience to be similar to that of christopher columbus or any other conqueror we literally left behind everything back in our hometown and embarked on a journey that was directed purely by our own instincts no one to guide us just us and our imaginations in our conquest of toronto we amassed jewels and gems we were wealthy but not by any material sense we were armed with powerful insights stories to tell and an experience that would forever be ingrained into our minds it was quite honestly the best day of all of our lives 

 when we awoke the next day we smiled to ourselves we weren’t smiling because we were still high we smiled because we remembered and we would never not remember it was like waking up from a really good dream the difference is that we didn’t dream it no the difference is that we lived it

18.296392,16.44232,Addicted," dmt holy fucking shit balls dmt 
holy fucking shit balls that is exactly what i said once i came back to my body from my dmt break through

the day before took 2 hits of acid i believe that is what helped me break through since the first time smoked i didnt accomplish did a lot of research

had 3 friends in the room with me

took one hit laid down on my bed closed my eyes

entered a dark blackgray tunnel then a door opens all kinds of fractals and mandala flower type shapes with bright lights all colors so bright hard to describe almost led and glowing running through each pattern of symmetry the most beautiful colors and shapes i have ever seen some points so vivid and bright to hard too look at

then i enter what felt like a room all green in color with vivid yellow running through it saw about 1015 elves with their backs to me working very hard and fast on something i was unsure of

felt a sense of uneasiness when that happened the greenyellow wall came down in a sliding motion an entityhumanoid appeared before me looked like a black man but he was black and gray almost like an old black and white photo he had on sun glasses he looked like a mixture of will smith and lelar burton jr strange i am a small white girl was this my spirit guide

when he appeared i heard music like none other almost a continuous ringing in a sense but sounded very comforting i felt warm then what was next infinite love my whole body felt an orgasmic feeling like none other we were communicating not with words but with thoughtsminds and he was telling me everything is ok just enjoy being there and he enjoyed my presence and he was happy to be with me

the wall came back up music stopped and the elves were working hard still i felt my head turn to the right then the left trying to see what they were working on they were far away from me in the room then all moved to the left hand corner of the room

once again a sense of uneasiness came on wall came down my entityhumanoid appeared he communicated with me asking how i was doing basically and i told him through my mind it was time for me to go i had my children and family to get back to he let me know he understood i thanked him several times for letting me join them and welcoming me with open arms he told me anytime and he was going to let me go to back to my family and to embrace my time with them

door opens colorful mandala flower shapes with bright led type lights occur i feel as if im floating then i feel myself start to wiggle my footfeet fingers im going back to my body open my eyes my boyfriend is standing in front of me he asks how i am im laying there at this point i look at the ceiling and it is moving so many fractals and walls are moving as if i took 4 hits of acidi sit up and say holy fucking shit balls that was the most amazing thing ive ever experienced im still tripping hard as fuck i have to lay back down lay down for about 5 more mins waiting for the room to calm down sit back up and then i am able to get up and walk and tell my boyfriendfriends about my experience

i was out of body for about 12 mins they told me  i felt like i was out of body for half my life ♥

the feeling of accomplishment of getting back to my body was awesome and i felt as if i were walking on a cloud

 i kept saying holy fuck and doing whoos 

i asked my friends that were in the room with me if they did see me turn my head as i laid there and they did

everyone has their views as to where we go on dmt my boyfriend thinks we are in a simulation and we are the entities test subjects to learn how to lovehate while they are in other dimensions or planets

i believe in god but dont label as a catholicchristian i have my own views as to what purgatory is and i believe it is just a place you go to before you go to heaven or hellthats where i believe i was because your dont die on dmt but you are re birthed

and i do agree with my boyfriend to an extent we just use different words we are gods test subjects to learn how to lovehate

so happy dmt found me it was so invigorating enlightening and spiritual and cant even put into words

should hang up the phone as they say but i might try it again one last time outside with nature

thankyou for reading ♥ "
13.622452,11.118059,Addicted,"30x salvia
this was the first time i had the chance to experiment with salvia at midnight the day of my 17th birthday i packed a 2 bowl asked my friends to light my brains out and i inhaled i was in a garage sitting in one incomfortable beach chairs they are the devil i start coughing my hit so i exhale i feel half of my face being pushed in i thought that was a shitty substance thats when my back melted through the chair becoming one with the wall behind me i knew something was wrong but becoming a wall was the least of my priorities my upper body was leaning on the left side putting alot of pressure on my ribcage it took all my concentration to move out of that metal bar only to fall on the other one my very high sitter just realized what tortured me and put me in a correct stance it was hard to look at him and thank him for two reasons 1  i couldnt talk for shit 2  his face was detached from his body that i couldnt see and drifted through the 4rth dimension i saw him as a serpentlike trail all of my friends around me looked like weirdass serpents the garage faded and i could see the universe i saw stars and geometrical colored shapes all behaving like ondulating waves not necessarily in a patern but all around my field of view throughout the trip i did nothing but say this chronological order  i dont feel it wooooooowwww fuuuuck babbled a few incoherent onomatopeias and laughed for 4 minutes i enjoyed it"
16.513247,17.389652,Addicted,"dmt  my first real experience
hello let me start off by saying i have had extensive amounts of psychoactive substances and i would like to caution people to first explore substances like lsd mushrooms mescaline ect before they embark on the substance that is dmtnndimethyltryptamine 

this experience was so amazingly powerful and was life changing in every way possible 

before i went for a high dose experience i wanted to see how my body and mind reacted to this substance i took a couple hits through a vaporizer and here is what i experienced 

1 hit an instant wave of euphoria all thoughout my body 

2 hits everything is in a geometric pattern mostly diamonds and pulsing

3 hits everything crashes to the floor and almost melts away and i close my eyes to see the most beautiful colors and patterns indescribable 



now for the real experience 

setsetting
  at around 100 am i went outside and sat down on a chair with a pillow behind my head the temperature was around 60 degreesmy favorite temp the sky was beautiful i had an early day at work everything was just going good i had this lure to do dmt again like something was calling my soul 

trip
130 pm  i remember this time in specific because i had my phone and i wanted to meditate to get rid of my preflight jitters by this time my heart was pounding but my breathing was at a good rate 

around 140 pm  i proceed to set up my vaporizer and take my first hit here is what follows 

1st hit my nervousness melts away i get an instant feeling of euphoria like the first time 

2nd hit this one is where everything really changed my surroundings became completely unrecognizable everything looked like as if i took lsd x 1000000

3rd hit visuals become extensively more intense but i have to ask myself do i need more i remembered reading that if you need to ask yourself that then you need more 

4th hit this this was the breaking point for me i took the biggest possible hit i could and held it in until i was forced to cough the exhale after this was so revealing in a weird way everything starts to look alien to me i hear a very distinct buzzing sound this slowly melts into a absolute silence it is so blissful 

the world starts rushing at me i am forced to close my eyes the first thing i encounter is a door but not like a door here it was in the shape of a triangle a thing opens the door and waves me to come in for whatever reason i feel threatened by this and i try to run the other direction 

this is the part that really made everything make sense to me 

a snake i vividly remember what this snake looked like it was made of squaregeometric patterns and it was a full rainbow of colors by this i mean colors that do not exist in this placeearth it wrapped itself around me and pulled me into a room that was all black with geometric patterns as the floor and as the walls i remember this is no light source but everything glows to provide reference to where it is the snake bites me but instead of it hurting it feelsfor lack of a better word orgasmic and i can see it is sucking a blueish fluid out of me into its body it gives me a menacing look and rips a hole in this room and reveals earth to me it seems like it wants me to ask something before i even ask a question is almost laughs at me and tells mewithout speaking that place is all fake simply an experiment maybe what you would call there a simulation it proceeds to laugh tell me thats the truth what will you make of it it proceeds to release me from its grasp and i fall through the floor i try to grasp onto the nothingness of this place but it isnt possible 

i wake up with almost a startled reaction as i felt like i was falling i felt like everything was not real 

for the past few days up until now i have the lingering feeling like everything is staged this world i am viewing doesnt seem real to me anymore not in a bad way but also not in a positive way

i honestly see the world differently and it disgusts me the way our society is running is not real this is all fake and we have been programmed to be fake 

i see high potential with this substance but warn anyone to try it you might not like what is behind the veil "

trip report

upon waking up i cooked an egg and had it for breakfast without hesitation i had decided to smoke a large dose of changa after finish my egg previously my changa experiments had all been fairly low dosed or i had only had the determination to smoke half of the bowl but this time was definitely going to be different

i filled my bowl with changa and went outside to bask in a chair placed directly under the burning sun i felt very comfortable but had no expectation of what i was going to be welcomed by on the journey overall a very mellow and relaxed state of mind
i also listened to the album by shpongle – museum of consciousness while i was having the experience it really helped me distance myself from my surroundings and focus more on the experience itself in all my previous changadmt experiences ive always been distracted by people talking tv or unfitting music

i was taking the first hit off of the bong but after inhaling a fair amount i found myself on the brink of coughing so i cleared the bong from smoke and held in the smoke for as long as i could upon exhalation i instantly recognized the characteristic effects of the changa i went into a very relaxed daze and quickly pulled myself together to smoke the remaining of the bowl

after exhaling the second and last hit my friend helped me but the bong down on the ground and i was out of this reality in a matter of seconds i almost forgot to exhale the second hit as i was instantly mesmerized by the instantaneously appearing fractal visuals and unbelievably quick onset
unlike all my previous experiences with changadmt this experience was extremely fast paced and not as relaxed as they usually are i felt like i was being bombarded with information at a speed that my brain simply couldnt keep up with it was the most intense feeling ive ever had i also noticed that the time completely vanished quickly after having exhaled all the remaining smoke the lack of time brought me into the moment of now unlike any other psychedelic experience has been able to there simply didnt exist anything outside of what i was experiencing
touching on the subject of time i can say with assurance that the trip itself lasted 12 minutes by looking at the duration of which the shpongle album had been playing however from my perspective after coming down it felt like i was away for 4060 minutes

returning to the experience itself just moment after being bombarded by information through the visual and audio input that i was receiving i entered an infinitely large place none of the walls surrounding the roomplace were visible to me seeing as they were so far away at the same time i also started seeing entities with humanlike limbs dance forth from the background they were dancing all the way up into my face and then faded back into wherever they came from i couldnt really count how many there were but i’d say there was at least a dozen entities dancing around me it was as if the music i was listening to was being controlled by these entities and that everything they did was in some way synchronized to what i was hearing
after just a few seconds of this going on the entities started creating things right in front of me using the dance and music that they themselves seemed to be creating the things themselves danced around just as much as the entities and were transforming to new objects very very rapidly they were of a very fractalish structure the entities seemed to sort of hide behind the objects or maybe they were just shoving them up into my face so that i could see them clearly although the objects were crystal clear like nothing ive ever seen the entities seemed to be quite a bit harder to get a grasp on

i could tell that they had definite human characteristics in the form of arms and legs but they were entirely made up of the most vividly colourful and changing lights my eyes have ever witnessed so i could definitely sense the outline of these entities but could in no way actually get a good look at their other characteristics due to their transforming nature

at some point during the trip the music in my ears vanished completely and i could only hear the sound of the entities and the room around me im having a very difficult time remembering the sounds i heard however but i felt very relaxed during this time as i was no longer being bombarded by the information contained within the song moments late the music returned but my visual experience remained fairly constant

i slowly regained some of my bodily presence and noticed that my breathing was very deep and relaxed it felt like the most profound meditation session ive ever had i also found myself to by lying in the grass covered in sweat and rolling around in my own saliva i really didnt care though i felt absolutely perfect in the moment the experience itself was just as powerful and personal as just a minutes prior to this but i felt much more relaxed and at home which slowed everything down by a notch

at this point i also entered a yawning phase which even outlasted the trip by 2 hours or so i was yawning several times a minute and each time i exhaled i also let out a very deep and relaxed sigh what really astonished me was that i realized when this happened that i could transform the objects which the entities had brought forth by myself it was beyond amazing to witness my voice synchronizing to every movement that was taking place behind my closed eyelids

after lying in the grass for a few minutes waiting for the trip to subside i unplugged my earbuds and i noticed that my mouth was full of grass i was very disorientated and was to my own surprise lying a fair distance away from the chair where the experience had begun my closed eye visuals also slowly subsided and the entities returned to the background scene where they came from
when i opened my eyes i was blown by the fractal structure of all the trees plants and grass around me everything was also fairly bright

what i wondered a lot about after the experience was the fact that the entities seemed to already be around me from the beginning of the experience in other words it felt as if they coexisted with everything in another dimension which became visible to me through the ingestion of dmt so they never really ”appeared” to me in that sense they were always with me

after the 12 minute experience was over i had the most wonderful after effects i have never felt so relaxed in my entire life and was literally in a meditative experience for up to 2 hours afterwards my breathing was very deep and i yawned countless times while being very content and happy about what i had just gone through and witnessed my ”hunger for dmt” had definitely been satisfied and i had finally been shown the sheer intensity and power contained within this chemical
after all my low dose experiences i was beginning to think that dmt wasnt really as powerful as people made it out to be on the internet as it seemed like something you could do several times a day and just have a good time this experience however truly established a deep respect for dmt and i no longer feel the constant need to search for when i can have my next trip

all in all this was the most beautiful and intense psychedelic experience i have ever gone through i am definitely in love with dmt"
14.662586,10.896686,Addicted,"25 tabs ecstasy
last year i started experimenting with mdma this was my fourth time taking it i took 2 and a half tabs of my 3 total my memory of the night is was shattered into many pieces so i cannot do a proper t  xmin report but the trip fades in comparison to the comedown here it goes

i had to walk a mile because i had helped a friend get home and took his bus instead of mine it did not matter to me i plugged my headphones into my ipod and started walking grinning at first soon after leaving my friend about an eighth of the mile i started realizing there was something wrong with my field of view as i walked forward thingspeople would dissapear i saw families around their car packing their things in complete silence i stopped briefly to see if they would stop seeing them move i start walking towards them when they dissapeared suddenly i looked around and it was like i was in one of those games with fog of war around you at a certain radius except that the fog in this case were humanoid shaped hallucinations i was absolutely fascinated by them but the mdma in me wanted me to walk i walked almost the whole thing never encountering any sign of real life near my house in a parking lot i looked up in the sky there was an orb of light its a parking light that was really shiny and pure white i was looking at it and i could see it pulse with energy it talked to me i telepathically had a deep conversation with a street light i didnt realize at the time it was a street light and i talked to it for about 30 minutes before snapping out of it i looked at the windows of the house right in front of the orb of light to see if any1 saw me i looked around and there was nobody i took out my ipod and just couldnt believe how the fuck time just fastfowarded 30 minutes went to bed after a whole evening of walking to get warmed up by diamond shitting sunshine riding unicorns in my bed this i made up but the rest is true my bed was just really comfortable"
16.312172,14.267183,Addicted,"ego death on an eighth of shrooms and a hit of shatter at the peak
another redditor asked me yesterday if i could explain ego death and i decided the nearly 6000 characters i wrote finally deserved its own post

when i had my ego death i didnt even know what it meant until it happened i was on shrooms id only been doing them a little while and i still wasnt sure what i was looking for im in my midthirties and had never taken a psychedelic that i remember i now question whether i might have done them years ago and blocked the experience i wanted to hallucinate above all id been taking smaller doses because i was nervous and didnt know what to expect i had no idea what the onset would be like if i would vomit if i would go crazy etc

finally i got brave and my best friend and i decided to do them together i brought over my home grown shrooms and i took a little over an eighth in my research i had found that the fact that i was taking a rather large dose of cymbalta greatly diminishes the effects of shrooms he took about 2g dry after about an hour we felt good and had light oevs he was definitely seeing more than i was i was seeing a shimmer and depth to things but no talking cat no twisting or bending of reality
to understand the setting i have to explain that my buddy is my drug buddy but also my best friend he has cerebral palsy and is a paraplegic he has been in a wheelchair since about 34 years old and we have known each other since we were both 18 or 19 years old we have seen each others girlfriends come and go over the years and weve smoked a lot of pot together we both work in the computer field and learn and problem solve together

right after wed eaten the shrooms he asked if i wanted to vape some shatter i said no wed better wait and see how strongly this affected us so the first hour was okay and we hit the peak at 90 minutes he was feeling really good as a lot of his pain dissipated but we hit 2 hours and werent tripping balls yet two to 25 hours is usually where i peak but since nothing special was happening i said to him lets vape that weed now i took the first hit a big one i think i let out a little cough its vapor after all and as i exhaled i started to feel it i handed him the vaporizer as it quickly took hold and said ill see you later buddy

the oevs were getting intense everything got quite a bit more vibrant i sat in his wifes gliderrocker and the cat jumped on my lap my body was vibrating not shaking suddenly any and all pain i had was gone i started petting the cat and saw that he had a gold aura surrounding his entire body when i pet him my hand could feel the aura it was warm and pulled at the atoms of my hand i noticed when i blinked that my view didnt change i closed my eyes and saw the most beautiful thing i was a hypercube and it was turning inside out but unlike looking at a 3d computer model of a 4d concept this made complete sense

i glanced over at my best friend who was now staring at the ceiling jaw agape i asked how he was feeling he said i dont feel any pain for the first time i can remember he was crying but smiling when he spoke i could feel his emotions as my own then i said to him suddenly i understand event horizon i dont need eyes where im going i closed my eyes and it felt as if my shoulders and hips didnt exist i could feel my hands and legs but they were detached they felt as if they were floating away then they were gone i was only my head and my mind
all these experiences kept washing over me i could go backward in time and recall all my personal experiences with perfect clarity each time i stopped on a memory it was as i was reliving it it was seeing memory as it was formed

now this is where it gets really difficult to explain i saw gold and red and all the patterns were vertical like thisurlcontentuploads201206alexgreybardobeingjpg with red instead of blue and no skulls and more vivid i was at the center of all these patterns my view widened past what the human viewing angle of approximately 95 degrees i could see 360 degrees but at this point it wasnt i anymore well i was but i was everything everyone who ever existed i had no sense of self i could no longer feel any of my body even when i think i opened my eyes i was no longer human i distinctly remember that realization i just was

the love i felt was like nothing else ive ever experienced most people understand being in love with someone but you cant feel other people loving you when i had ego death i felt all the love in the universe accepting me in fact as the intensity build on the comeup i kept repeating love and acceptance to myself to calm my anxieties this is the best i can explain it ego death is where you cease to exist as an individual as a human being you received verification that exactly as bill hicks said that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively there is no such thing as death life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves

ive never really been afraid of death i recognized my own mortality at a young age but now i look forward to death knowing what is there what has also been verified by a very recent dmt breakthrough im not looking for death but i will welcome it when it comes no pain no suffering no bullshit only love and light and peace

i hope that helps the rest of you along with the redditor that requested it its very important to remember that this is my subjective experience and that mindset and setting going into a trip can produce a very different ego death experience some people have the same loss of self but during a frightening experience i believe though as many do that there is no such thing as a bad trip if your purpose for the trip is to find answers there may be frightening or negative things presented to you but there are always insights to be found in any introspective trip"
18.808819,15.62523,Addicted,"impromptu dmt trip dmt
some background info i was back at my parents home for winter break and one of my friends from high school invited me over to his house ill call him b i drove over and he was there with another friend of ours who ill call c b and c were smoking weed and offered me some but ive got a drug test coming up so i declined we talked for a while and then we decided to go play some video games after a few minutes b asks me if i would like to smoke some dmt since he has a little bit id been wanting to try dmt for a few months now but i wasnt sure if i was in the right frame of mind to do it at this moment i decided that i might not find any dmt for a long time so i told b that i wanted to do it 

we moved to a room with a bed for me to lie down on so that id be comfortable during the trip b and c start loading the dmt into a vaporizer and i go to get a drink of water because i was pretty nervous at this point and i was shaking a little bit i ask b if he has any advice and he tells me to take a few deep breaths to calm my body b asks if i want any music playing but nothing comes to mind im still shaking pretty badly from the nerves but i grab the whip and start inhaling

the trip i inhale for about 30 seconds and dont really feel anything i think the temperature on the vape was off or maybe there wasnt that much dmt but im not feeling the effects i had read about i try taking another hit i look around the room and see fractals overlaying everything i look at i get a rush through my body and the shaking disappears my mind is in a tripping state now and i start doubting whether i can handle the trip but only for a fraction of a second immediately after i become very calm and a great happiness overtakes me i look around a bit more at my hands and everything in the room then i take one more hit and i hold in for as long as i can i start feeling very disconnected from my body and start to think how much longer i should hold in my breath when i finally exhale after about 20 seconds the sound of my breath leaving my body sounds very animalistic and im reminded that humans are in fact animals and not a different class of being as we often perceive ourselves i look at the carpet and it is separated into hexagons like a honeycomb and a small column of carpet is poking out from the middle of each theres no more dmt in the vape and i didnt manage to break through like i hoped but i am completely content with what im experiencing i tell b to put on some bach and i lie down on the bed 

i close my eyes but the light above me is too bright so i ask b to turn the light off b turns the light off and starts playing bachs violin concerto in a minor i start feeling as though im moving forward through darkness but when i look closer there are pulsating fractals in my entire field of vision they arent very obvious but once i notice them they are impossible to miss in my mind i start moving forward to the flow of the music zooming in from fractal to fractal as the music continues i become more and more elated with the pure beauty of it i hear a note in the concerto that i hadnt paid attention to before and i let out one exclamation from surprise i hear myself and that single sound reaffirms my love of myself and my assurance that i am living my life in the way that makes me happiest the laugh resonates me i start to notice something to my left sliding in and out of the fractals as i move forward and after looking closer i notice that its a cat of some sort it has neon colors for a face that keep changing back and forth and it moves through the fractals at the tempo of the music theres another cat to my right and they are both moving with me while we bathe our minds in the perfection that is bach the cats look at me every once in a while but otherwise they dont interact with me 

the first movement ends and i stop moving forward i wait for the second movement to start but b had used youtube to find the first movement i try to tell b to put on the next movement but he start the 3rd movement of the mendelssohn violin concerto instead while i do love mendelssohn i dont have as much of an emotional connection with his music as i do to bachs when the music starts i start moving forward again and the fractals start to alternate faster to the faster tempo i can feel the effects of the dmt fading as the piece progresses but not before seeing hundreds of lizards sliding past each other i think that bachs music must be feline in nature and mendelssohns is lacertine as the effects fade more and more my first thought is that i want more i also wonder whether i should lay down in bed for longer because b really wanted me to have a break through trip as all the fractals start to fade away i realize that the experience i had was wonderful and that i didnt want any more dmt and that pretending to be tripping would be silly and unnecessary 

after the trip i sat up and b asked me how my trip was i start by telling him that he knows how hard it is to describe a dmt trip ive barely done the whole experience justice here then i tell him that it wasnt a breakthrough trip and he says oh in a disappointed way right away i say not oh in a disappointed way but ooohhh in an amazed way i tell him about my trip as best i can and i give him a hug and thank him for the experience i felt very refreshed after the trip and my mind was extremely clear 

the experience made me revisit my thoughts about god i most certainly dont believe in a god like most religions pray too i think that if there is a god it isnt some sentient being that can think or help an individual if there is a god its some force that is the driving force of the universe im still not able to phrase my feelings on this subject well but ill keep exploring and hopefully ill be able to before my life is over "
9.163905,11.045949,Addicted,"an interesting weed exp blunt
extra info i smoke small bowls daily and the occasional 12 blunt when i’m out hiking or biking enjoy 

the story
i’m smoking in a one room cabin next to the woods i roll up a blunt of some weed i’ve been smoking this weed for the last few weeks i decide to light it and take a walk through the woods 

i begin the walk with a focus on being present and aware of the nature around me running my hands through the leaves and really observing the world around me all the while i’m taking moderate pills from the blunt about every min or so 

i come to an open area and decide to sit and watch the woods just to see what is going on around me i spot a small spider on my leg harmless the spider continued across my leg to the edge and they shot its web to a blade of grass and walked across 

i was amazed by this spider the wind was actually pretty fast i’m spider terms but this small creature aimed and timed its shots perfectly it continued on and i slowly followed it it was during my focus on the spider that a thought appeared 

humanity is intelligent selfaware beings of a level not experienced elsewhere in nature 

humanity and their ability to think in such complex and unique ways has giving us a huge step up in this world the gravity of that really hit me without the existence of life outside our earth proven then we are it

we are the culmination of millennia of events the intelligence and ability of humanity is staggering and come with a burden a burden to protect those that haven’t achieved 

it was a profound realization i wouldn’t call myself an environmentalist but the more i’m in nature the more i want to preserve it there’s a serenity about being around so much life and being able to idly sit by and watch it 

below the tldr is what i wrote immediately after the moment 

tldr had an amazing nature walk and recognized the significance of human intelligence and how it stands apart from other known life 

“
our existence in this universe as selfaware life humanity is a miracle of creation acceptance of developing life and encountering other life is also available however until they are discovered i retain my initial statement our existence in this universe as selfaware life humanity is a miracle of creation 


our miracle does not devalue other creations instead it gives upon us the responsibility to protect and nurture them if we don’t without other selfaware life to exist we will be taking a huge step backward in evolution 
“

i traded the word selfaware for intelligence in my post since i felt selfaware is recognized in some animals not quite sure also smoked a whole blunt alone in like 1520min it was burning really quick did not mean to smoke that much 😅

16.037947,15.415089,Addicted,"lemon tech 🍋
before i begin i think it’s important to say i’ve taken mushrooms and acid many times and always have had good intense experiences but this experience was the most intense of all my trips to date and the most beautiful

i had this experience today i decided to try the lemon tech so i took around 25 grams of mushrooms ground them up and put them into some lemon juice i let the mushrooms sit in the lemon juice for about an hour and then slammed it and chased it with some water i hadn’t eaten anything so my stomach was empty 

the high came on in about ten minutes and immediately i started to see fractals and feel my energy lift i decided i was going to meditate so i sat and listened to some meditation music and that intensified everything the fractals became full geometric patterns that danced in every color you can imagine and some you can’t i had energy vibrating throughout my entire body and at one point the vibrations got so intense i felt it completely lift me out of my body before i knew it i was in another dimension face to face with this beautiful celestial being 

she was a tall green being with beautiful features she had this fleshy hair that was done into two braids that hung down to her waist beautiful bright eyes that seemed like they had galaxies inside of them and she spoke in sounds pleasant tones and nodes played when she opened her mouth and somehow i could understand her perfectly i asked her what her name was and she got giggly and shy but she told me she took my in her arms and hugged me as she whispered secrets in my ear she told me the universe is one giant embryo and the earth was at the center of this embryo and everything is one gigantic being and we are part of it we come from the earth and because of this we have a sacred bond with it and that the earth will help us attain our new level of consciousness if we listen she also said we have lost touch with how to communicate with the earth and we need to remember how

then another being walked in this one a man or a masculine version of their species he was a tall being with blue skin a long wirey beard that was made into a perfect point and he had this stern look on his face almost angered and i just looked at him and smiled  and his expression changed to a very soft loving energy they told me that they are the “mother and father” of this universe and that i am one of their children and as one of their children i need to learn their ways learn how to get in touch with myself light my chakras and reach nirvana then and only then will i be mature and capable enough to live in this dimension with them i sat with them for a while asked them questions and we laughed and cried together this part of the trip was really special because it seemed like i had some kind of connection with these beings 

after the conversation they hugged me again and told me that i had to leave until i was ready they then introduced me to another being

this is where it gets a little more strange they said that the being they introduced me to was a “spiritual teacher” this teacher was one of the more frightening looking beings but had a beautiful energy around it this teacher took me to a desolate galaxy with no other beings and showed me a “band of the universe” this “band” looked like millions of light years worth of strands of dna the teacher then began to manipulate the energy and create a planet the planet had rings like saturn but still looked like the strands of dna we walked on these rings and then sat and meditated this teacher taught me how to “learn my light” and how to light my chakras we sat there for years meditating before the teacher finally told me that our time was coming to a close and to practice and never forget what i have learned i told it that i would never forget embraced it and floated back into my body 

i’m still trying to make sense of it all but i feel like a lot of questions have been answered all in all my trip was life changing i learned so many things and i also learned that for myself personally i can get higher with the naturals in our world than with man made drugs like acid and i enjoy it more 

this is definitely a turning point in my psychedelic journey if you made it this far thank you for reading"

17.873373,12.137084,Addicted,"trip report first time lsd
hey all i took lsd for the first time yesterday and this is how it went down
730amate my sugar cube on an empty stomach and played battlefield 2 and arcade fires funeral album waiting for the come up
745750ish i noticed something was different but couldnt figure it out colors were a bit enhanced and felt a bit nauseous

around 815 the game was getting harder to play and the music was becoming incredible
830ish i played with my dog outside and had tracers when i threw the tennis ball i saw a trail of neon yellow through the air my back yard had a bunch of colorful roses and flowers and was amazing also the sky was like a blue and violet mix

i lost track of time here but remember what happened things started to pick up pretty quickly the cement in the brick walls started to flow in the bricks and everything looked super 3d walls were breathing inside i laid down on the ground and my dog came up and licked my face and i started cracking up his face was hilarious my friend and i always joke about how he kinda looks human well on acid he looks human x10 i watched his curly tail get curlier

i kept getting into thought loops and everything seemed to happen frame by frame thankfully i wrote youre okay  on my hand and it helped me a ton as i looked at it though the ink would stretch on my hand and my fingers looked crazy

i then walk down my street to my friends house because i was taking care of his dogs for the weekend the walk down was magnificent i watched peoples driveways flow and form waves like at the end of the acid scene in that woodstock movie flowers seemed to explode and i couldnt stop smiling

once i get in his house he had a trippy ass table cloth i watched the patterns raise off of it then go back on to it i zoned out into it and forgot what i was thinking about then my trip sitter knocked on the door and freaked me out this is where things got even more amped up

he was going to smoke weed and i really missed when i was able to but cant due to drug testing so i was clean for 25 months i realized i had a four day weekend and could most likely get clean by the end of it so i said why not

i take a 1 mid sized rip and thats all i needed i held it in looked up in the sky and it just exploded and was amazing the clouds seemed to get lower and lower until the point where i sank into my chair to not be taken into it when i exhaled everything melting together it was mind blowing his house melted into the trees and had the branches curl into it

i wanted to go inside but stay outside so i sat in the middle of the doorway that was so crazy if you havent done it i recommend it you can feel the different atmospheres the inside and outside felt like they were pushing together the inside seemed peaceful and introspective while the outside was lively and adventurous we went inside for a while

from here im positive im at my peak everything seemed really candylike his outside brim of hiis closet looked like the airhead xtreme candy strips flowing around all his furniture was bright and looked kinda like carmel but melted into the ceiling i saw patterns on the ceiling i cannot describe those

i went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror that was incredible and is where i learned about alot about myself you can take 2 paths going in there the happy path where you learn the positives about yourself and the bad path where you learn flaws about yourself i took both at different times and found lessons that i wanna keep private also watching your face morph and change was sick we watched a bunch of cartoons like danny phantom adventure time sesame street etc and that all seems to be made for acid it was perfect
i went home around 2pm and put my music on shuffle while i watched tv i didnt know how to change the channel and that show general hospital was on the lyrics in the music fit perfect with the mouths moving and was hilarious

after that i was coming down and played xbox i still felt energized and colors were still vibrant but no more flowing patterns melting visuals

i still have the color enhancement which i think is sick and 10 out of 10 would do again

20.509169,13.361669,Addicted,"my first mushroom trip 7g
this is my first trip report so any advice would be greatly appreciated for future trip reports this is not a recent trip report as i have had atleast 80 trips since then this was a very challenging experience i was 21 at the time

its march break of 2016 and i want to try my first psychedelic experience a week before this i tried 2 grams of cubes but i only got the giggles with no visuals or sensations in my body so i thought i needed more the next time i was ignorant didnt research and i deserved what i got i go out of town to pick up an ounce of shrooms and i didnt know what type of magic mushroom i had purchased which i now know were blue meanies 

after a 3 hour drive i head home i was staying with my sister and her boyfriend at the time because my girlfriend had kicked me out of the house my mindset was to trip out and take my mind off of my breakup and my son who i now wasnt allowed to see until i went to court i was such an idiot how could i not do research beforehand i had no respect for psychedelics back then

i walked into the door and asked my sister and her boyfriend if they wanted to do shrooms they said no i sat on the couch and pulled out my scale and weighed out 7 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms i grabbed them all and just chewed them up in my mouth until it was gunk and swallowed took about 10 minutes just to get it all down its about 2 pm in the afternoon

t 000  finally they are all down the hatch im sitting on the couch talking to my sister and her boyfriend about doing mushrooms and they are gaining interest we have a couple smokes together and pass the time they head into their bedroom

i feel pain in my arm and i start to have pain in my chest i feel my heart and its speeding up and stopping and starting again oh my god im dieing of a heart attack i go to the bathroom and start throwing up i fall onto my side and i start to die i pull out my phone to call 911 but i dont know how to my sisters boyfriend comes in the bathroom and holds my hand im curled in a ball on the floor i tell him to call 911 he does he passes me the phone i put it on speaker and place it on the tile floor it went to voice mail  no fucking way im dead im dead

nobody can save me i cant see anymore i start seeing visions of my life all bad memories everybody i hurt all the bad things i did i realized that i didnt do any drugs and i was just having memory problems i am an 85 year old man dieing of a heart attack i think i have memory problems and i convinced myself i wasnt on drugs i regret everything the way i treated my ex not spending enough time with my child all the hard drugs i have done and the life i had loathed in carelessly i hear laughter the whole world is laughing at me i deserve this this is all my fault i am a horrible person this pain is what i deserve

i tell the operator that if i die to tell everyone im sorry he said the ambulance was on the way but i knew i knew deep down he wanted me to die because he seen all of the wrong i have done he wasnt sending an ambulance why am i still dieing is this what death is im stuck in time forever to see and feel the pain i caused others in this world i have no good memories this is what hell is im going to feel the pain i caused for eternity i got a sudden burst of energy and jumped up and ran towards the couch i pulled my pants down and ran around screaming so fucking embarrassing

the paramedics walk in the door and immediately start to aid me they are going to kidnap me and kill me i know it please dont kill me my sister pulls one of the paramedics aside and tells them im trying to kill myself they grab me by the arms and start to walk me out the door they force me onto a stretcher and start to strap me in please dont kill me stop they put me in the back of the ambulance i finally focus on the paramedics face he has a burn scar across his whole face he wasnt real he is an alien with someones face on his own they are abducting me

 i was strapped down i couldnt move he pulled out a temperature gun you aim it at the head to take someones temperature quickly i thought it was some type of alien weaponry he aims it in my face it beeps i feel pain in my head i think my brain is melting please no i started calming down im sleepy i close my eyes and went unconcious

i wake up in the hospital in a hallway i look around and im no longer tripping what the fuck just happened to me
they psych evaluated me and released me i walk home and go to bed

it took me this long to fully understand what happened to me that day it changed my life i moved on from my previous relationship and i am now engaged i quit smoking crack and i no longer drink alchohol i have a newborn daughter with my fiance and i couldnt be more proud to be where i am today i am thankful i was as irresponsible as i was to do what i did it changed my life

18.241783,14.163312,Addicted,"today shrooms changed my life
today was a day that has changed my life i have recently been experimenting with shrooms after doing lots of research and contemplating it this last year i decided to grow them myself as i didn’t know where to get them locally i found some spores on line and some all in one grow bags on amazon the first couple times i took 15g and only ever noticed some more vibrant contrasted visuals but nothing much more than that

trip 1 1 week ago
last week i decided to take 25g in some mint tea i had a great come up and was dancing around at my desk playing overwatch during the peak i felt like i needed to shower so i hopped in and turned on some meditation music i had never meditated before but figured i would give it a whirl i sat down criss cross apple sauce on the shower floor hands rested on my knees and water pouring over my body the room was dark with a couple led night lights giving a very relaxing vibe the music was perfect slow gentle and eased me into thought i focused on breathing and attempted to lower my heart rate i would glance at my apple watch every now and again to see starting off around 86bpm and worked my way down to 55bpm i got lost in thought thinking a little about everything  this lasted about an hour and i got up and was fine now this was all still in a level 1 category hardly any visuals just some contrasted colors and slight distortion it was a great experience and left me wanting to do it again

trip 2  today level 23
i stayed up all night worrying and sipping on a few beers my little brother27 was recently diagnosed with aplastic anemia and does not have insurance we are waiting for his red and white blood cells to drop in order to get considered for a free clinical trial with a 90 success rate using horse antibodies to destroy and target his cells that are attacking his bone marrow the stress on myself and my parentsfamily have been pretty hard lately as he his constantly getting platelet transfusions every other week i woke up the next morning exhausted and called in sick for work slept a few more hours and got up around 11am my buddy messaged me he was passing by my area and i invited him over my house was a mess and we began cleaning as i promised my wife i would clean up since i stayed home from work i had thought about making some more tea prior to my buddy coming over to help lightin my depressed and sluggish mood so when he arrived i asked if he cared to join me he agreed and i measured out 45g intending to double out my dose from last week in order to split between us i crushed them up and made some more mint tea this time with 4 cups of water we split it and decided to turn on some of his groove disco music and relax on the couch about 30 minutes later i had a rush of vibrant contrastedcolors suddenly appear like normal along with some heavy distortion on the brick fire place i felt ok and we laughed a bit he was feeling great and getting his jam on another 20 minutes go by and i started to feel uneasy i began worrying that my wife was about to come home to us tripping balls as the visuals increased to a point of making me dizzy my phone screen was feeling “3d” with double images and i had a hard time focusing i stood up and walked around a minute and sat back down i was dizzy and sick to my stomach and realized i had taken more than i was expecting i don’t usually have much anxiety and up until this point i never really new what it felt like i was having an anxiety attack i felt as if my buddy and his music was pushing me from the room every ounce of my body screaming to get out of there i quickly scrambled for a phone charger as my phone was about to die and went to take a shower excusing myself i attempted the meditation music and tried lowering my heart rate to no avail i felt as if i was my mind was fighting to stay in reality i came out of the shower and went back out my buddy said i looked like shit and asked if i was ok i let him know i wasn’t feeling good and needed to sleep he was having a great trip riding his “rainbow commit” to his disco groove music at this moment my wife called and let me know she was on the way home she could hear the uneasiness in my voice and i told her i may have accidentally taken to much shrooms and needed her to come home quick i hung up and got in bed i put on my head phones returned to the mediation music and covered my face under the covers i noticed the weight of the comforter started to calm me slightly along with the heat and sweat around my bodyit took me a bit but i finally started to feel a bit of relief and my mind started wondering i began thinking about my brother and my parents and how much they are all hurting right now as my mind started wondering around i all of a sudden had a vivid mental image of my wife’s face pop into my head i had an overwhelming epiphany i did not have to share this burden alone my newly wedded wife of 15 years would be there by my side and be my rock i realized that deep down inside a part of me must of questioned our relationship questioned whether or not she was meant for me and if i found “my person” in life i realized at this moment that i 100 knew she was my one and only i had thought this to be true prior obviously which is why we got married but i guess deep down inside there was doubt instantly after coming to this realization i felt an overwhelming relief of all that anxiety and stress i felt this warm welcoming embrace come over my body it was the most blissful indescribable feeling i had ever felt i needed my wife with me at this very moment i longed for her to experience this feeling with me yet i realized that something amazing just happened and was continuing to happen and i needed to go through this by myself some time went by as i continue ride this wave of bliss and emotion i realized how intimate and personal these feelings were and at least for me shrooms in general i realized that my buddy downstairs was in his world and i was in mine and our energies were on different paths i did some serious soul searching and was briefly tapped on the shoulder i opened my eyes to the most beautiful thing i had ever laid eyes on my wife was glowing she had a golden hugh around here as if she was my angel sent down from heaven just for me she was the only one at the moment that got me and would get me even as i attempted to describe to her this life changing experience she left me alone and i continued to ride the wave out for another hour or so until i came back to reality my wife thinks i’m a little crazy now and thinks i should lay off the shrooms but i would give anything for her to witness my experience i wish there was a way for her to listen to my thoughts as i went through this a lot of specific thoughts has already started to fade from my memory from earlier today as if awakening from a dream i feel immense clarity now however i left a small note on her car steering wheel tonight before i started writing this just letting her know how amazing she is and wishing her a good day as i will be sleeping in when she heads off to work

this has been a remarkable experience that these words don’t do justice i realize i was not ready for this trip starting out but luckily i was able to change my element and finally relax myself in order to have this revelation i hope you all experience the love and bliss that i had a chance to today i’m still scared to increase my dose and attempt the next level but i believe if i continue to take 23g over the next year and practice getting in the mindset i may be ready to take the leap"
17.302305,15.773864,Addicted,"lsd  1800ug  a totally new experience
let me start off with saying i have done a vast amount of lsd in my short lifetime and have done varying doses of this incredible substance anywhere from 100ug now all the way up to 1800ug before this my highest experience was 1000ug about a year ago 

alright let us begin time stamps are averaged out 

800 am  i have the 20i average down to 1800ug because i am assuming not every tab is 100ug exactly tabs all ready to consume i take them and let them sit in my mouth for 30 minutes 

845 am  i have swallowed the tabs and am eating a nice breakfast i figure i wont be hungry later on and my body will need the fuel

930 am  i am starting to feel a rush of energy that is quite familiar with my higher doses i am feeling anxiety but i find that almost calming knowing that this is really about to happen 

1000 am  first sign of visuals my ceiling looks like a river flowing from on side to the other 

1200 pm  last two hours have been ramping up visuals i would say the effects have really kicked in now starting to get that fading effect where everything seems to fade almost like someone is painting everything as it happens incredible 

1230 pm  i have a fan on and i close my eyes and the wind the fan is producing makes it feel like i am in a frozen tundra laying in the snow i get lost in the cev not even listening to music 

110 pm  i throw on my headset and by now my whole visual spectrum is filled with distortions i swear even the air seems like it has patterns in my peripheral vision i look out at the bright blue sky and the clouds are swirling into different figures and sky looks like an ocean with tides and the clouds are the sandy white beach music feels like it is pulsing through me honestly the most incredible feeling i have experienced i can see the colors on the song around my vision and i can taste the heavy beats they are thick and delicious 

200 pm  oh geez people are here more specifically my girlfriend she convinces me to go on a walk and i thank her for this i can feel the sunlight shine throughout my soul and it warms my entire being the road is simply flowing down into an endless stream of beauty 

230 pm  the peak is begging and i am starting to encounter some major ego death reality is fading away from me and becoming a facade of patterns and pulsing feeling i can feel the earth hug me when i lay down on the grass 

245 pm  at this point i am lost i dont know if me eating a big meal right after the tabs prolonged the real kick in but the world is so bright and colorful i can taste the colors and feel sight i have never experienced anything so beautiful i listen to bring me to life  evanescence  and it sends shivers down my spine amy lees voice sounds so beautiful and comforting that i start to cry i have such an overwhelming sense of joy i realized that i could die right in this moment and i would be okay with it 

300 pm  my girlfriend is hungry and so am ishe knows i am on lucy but she has only done it once with me and does not really understand how substantial of a dose this is anyways we go to a little mexican place and immediately she is giving me major anxiety she wants me to order and pay yeah right i can barely read the menu it looks like it is jumping around the sign i somehow manage to order nachos and some memorizing green soda damn it is the most beautiful color i have ever seen 

330 pm  i have never really gotten much flavor enhancement from lucy but this this is unreal it taste like little carbonated creatures are swimming all over my tongue and filling my heart with happiness 

400 pm  there is a baby crying and people are yelling at each other in spanish total bad vibes are hitting me im sweating and i just really need to get out of here but i dont want to make a scene i feel like everyone knows im just totally blitz out of my mind i manage to leave fuck the food i am never going back in there again 

435 pm  movie time was not planning on this but aye why not we were going to see the new pirates of the caribbean the seats in the theater reclined and the instant satisfaction i found myself sitting in this heavenly chair was so wonderful 

450 pm  i go to the bathroom and the black door with white dots looks like a black hole it looks 4dimensional and i know that is impossible but somehow i just know it was 4dimensional for whatever reason whenever i take lovely lucy i get pretty bad gas after i drink or eat so there i am sitting there on the toilet at first i had anxiety from all the sounds of piss and people walking around but then i just closed my eyes and had ego death again but in a different way i keep trying to think of a way to explain my realization but it is impossible to type you would need to experience it just how i did and that is most likely impossible 

515 pm  what it is only 515 i thought i had been in the bathroom for atleast 1 and a half hours 

 700 pm  the movie ended sometime around 700 at this point time was not a thing to me usually by now i would be coming down but really it feels the same from the beginnings of the peak no complaints here 

730 pm  i am back at my girlfriends house and yes its about that time sex i have never had sex on any drug but weed before and i was ready for this i dont want to get into too much detail as i know that will just bother some of you but the just of the sexual act was my girlfriend gave me head the orgasm i had was like a fucking revelation i felt like all the joy in the world was bottled up inside me and it went pop and rained all over me it was by far the best feeling in my entire life so far 

1000 pm  i had spent the last 2 12 hours having sex and listening to music and it was magical now i am starting to come down so i walk home 

200 am  all that remains is a clear head feeling and a complete sensation of wellbeing i smoke some weed and end up falling asleep at some point 

conclusion this was by far the biggest and most important psychedelic experience of my lifetime i experienced two very unique instances of egodeath and had many revelations during them i can now say i am not afraid of dying the whole reason i wanted to document this experience is to give a slightly detailed experience of a heroic dose of lsd 

i would strongly recommend you progress a ladder of dosses like i have before i did this i did 100ug 200ug 400ug 600ug 800ug 1000ug and finally i felt comfortable enough for this i would also strongly recommend having someone who you trust and love around you i felt safe the whole time knowing my girlfriend without a doubt loves and trusts me and if shit hit the fan she could take care of me and i think that without her going outside and interacting with people would of been a complete nono and might of dulled down the overall experience just sitting at the computer the whole time 

i really hope this either encourages a fellow experienced psychonaut to leap into the rabbit hole this type of dose is or to help a lessexperienced tripper realize they may need to work their way up 

one last disclaimeryes i know this is already long enough if you are going to attempt this high of a dose test your lucy i dont care if your fucking mom sold this to you taking 20 tabs of a research chemical is most likely going to be fatal or is going to seriously fuck you up be careful trip safely friends "
18.266932,14.251152,Addicted,"first time fcking with lsd xtal
this is a long love story about my experiences with lsd about a year ago i finally got my hands on what i considered to be the real deal for background purposes ive done a lot of substances it would be faster to name the ones i havent done my taste in drugs lies mostly in psychedelics massive doses of psychedelics


my fascination began after reading fear and loathing in las vegas hunter thompson i had to know what it was like to try some of the real deal psychedelics from the sixties prior to my first acid trips i had experimented with mushrooms several 2cx compounds dmt some rcs as well as some 25x compounds not a fan of the latter anyways to say the least i never trusted anything called acid i would try to hunt down blotters but they were never lsd they were always 25x bs


so i stopped looking to the streets for something that practically doesnt exist on the streets anymore i dont want to get into where i sourced it from but i had found a powerful new resource for sourcing most any drug know to man kind for the first time in my life i had come face to face with this elegant powerful fascinating mind bending molecule fit on a little piece of colored paper sitting in the palm of my hand


the first hits i bought were advertised at 100ug hits i had purchased a 10 strip i sold half of it to my friend who was one of my close tripping buddies as we had both been dying to try this holly grail of the psychedelic kingdom the first night i had a chance i cleared everything out of my life for the next day and ate two of the blotters i got a pretty nice trip music induced the most amazing euphoria i had ever experienced i got some nice tracers melting walls brightened visual patters pretty easy going standard trip


flash forward a few months my stock ran out i had tripped twice on cid i bought another teen strip from a different suppler advertised at 200ug per hit these where certainly much stronger that the first batch the first time i tried the batch i took 2 hits 400ug i basically got all the effects as the first couple of trips just amplified along with the tracers i got some fuzzy visual patterns my vision became more distorted but still no fractals no intense introspection there was a very pronounced body load indicitive of a presence of isolsd isolsd means the chemist who made the acid got lazy and didnt do a chiral chromatographic separation or two to isolate the pure dextrolsd but you take what you can get i didnt have 20000 to start my own small scale production lsd lab


i spent the next year and a half trying different blotters i have no doubt that all the stuff was actual lsd it was all tasteless active thru straight ingestion not sublingually like the 25x and produced effects consistent with what lsd has been described as


i had a couple of grievances though i compared the doses of the lsd as advertised with dosage scales on erowid as well as anecdotal reports like reports of potency of acid from the counter culture revolution the doses of lsd i was taking should have been producing much richer more powerful effects stan owsley sound engineer and acid chemist of the grateful dead use to produce 270ug hits of lsd that were sheering peoples faces clean off opening their minds to perceptions and realities never conceived by the human mind i was taking 400ug of modern acid and getting quite high having a good time but it wasnt what i thought it should be for 400ug


finally i scored i scored big time for a jaw droppingly low price i was able to buy crystaline lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate 102mg i bought i received it in a uv proof static proof sealed envelope usually used for storing highly sensitive microprocessors inside was the crystal carefully wrapped with love in a small piece of weigh paper like wax paper for lab use it was a perfect medium because non of the crystal stuck to the paper i bought some 15ml dropper bottles and a fifth of everclear using the dropper i carefully measured 400 drops of everclear into the dropper bottle


finally the last step i opened the little wax paper packet of lsd crystal this stuff was so beautiful i almost blew a nut in my pants when i laid eyes on it it was the consistency of light tinny crystals it wasnt really powdery just really small pure white crystals almost like snowflakes so white and pure after drooling over the beauty of the crystals for an hour or so i made the vial i dumped the crystals into the vial of everclear they dissolved instantly on contact with the liquor  i sealed the vial gave it a shake and it was ready


i couldnt wait to try it i had made the vial at my friends house we both dosed pretty much instantly after it was preped i gave him 8 drops 200ug i was a little selfish and took 600ug hoping desperately to finally reach the peak i had been longing to find for so long well hot diggity damn did i find it we just took the lsd as liquid right on the tongue as is


you can feel the stuff sliding down the back of your throat it has a very distinct feeling i rinsed it down with some water or soda i dont remember to be honest and wow


this shit hit me almost instantly from the second it hit my tongue something felt different i couldnt quite tell you how this was about a year ago so i am recalling the best i can after about 5 minutes i could fell the come up i felt a little floaty a little bit of uncertainty brewing did i take too much not enough 10 minutes in and my periferal vision was lighting up like a mother fucker i was seeing the walls behind me change color no shit like i could see the walls behind me changing spectacular colors but i wasnt looking at the walls this applied to whatever was behind me there was an ora of color behind me that i could somehow see


20 minutes in and im bracing myself on my friends couch there has been no body load but i am coming on hard this shit hit me almost as hard as taking a hit of dmt it seriously rocketed me into another realm slang shot me off the face of the planet i realy began to lose track of time here

i spent the next 20 minutes smoking cigarettes and drinking water i think i had two sips of a beer but alcohol seemed like such a primitive pathetic drug compared to what i was about to experience

the peak

i sat down on the couch and loaded up the bong it was about 35 minutes since dosing i think my friend had put on some little feat or peter gabriel or some sort of dank music i proceed to take two hits from the bong and things really got sideways from there

i laid back on the couch rubbed my eyes i was getting overwhelming visual changes i was seeing tracers color shifts any sort of intricate patterns seemed to begin dancing around the carpet began to creep up the wall the stairs begin to rotate sideways as if in a funny house at a carnival all i could remember thinking is i hope i dont have to piss anytime soon because the bathroom is upstairs and i dont know how the fuck i could tackle those fucked up sideways stairs in this condition

i lost all touch with reality more or less i could remain lucid for a second or two but the trip would suck me back into the oblivion it was creating in my mind

my friend and i went outside we wanted a change of scenery we rolled up some cigarettes and went for a walk
it was a beautiful clear summer night the light pollution was relatively low as we walk thru the parking lot i couldnt help but notice how distorted my vision was my vision was almost folding in on itself when looking off into the starry sky but when looking at the nearby parked cars it seemed to be be like looking thru a wide angle lens or fish eye lens we walked up to the street

i sat down on the curb and lit my smoke my friend walked half way across the road and became distracted looking up into the sky we exchanged somewhat sarcastic words to each other untill i noticed some oncoming traffic in the distance hes just standing there in the middle of the road gazing into the night sky with a huge grin on his face and pupils the size of fucking quarters i shout get out of the fucking road before you get run over he realizes whats going on and scampers to the other side of the road we had a good laugh and walked back to the apartment

we excepted that we would be up all night we look at the clock its 11pm we had dosed at 10pm we both look at each other and simultaneously say oh fuck one minute was an eternity i sit on the couch foolishly thinking i needed one more bong rip

i took that rip before we began our trip that night i had prepared a small amount of ghb in a cup of cola about 2 grams in case i needed a downer to take the edge off the trip i drank about half the cola i lay down on the couch i feel an energy running from my brain down my spinal chord i felt like my mind was fucked i was frying i literally was frying i began to get these bizarre audio hallucinations it was kind of a higher pitched echoy frequency that would descend in pitch until i could no longer hear it the walls were fluidly waving and morphing

i closed my eyes i didnt want to see how distorted everything was i was peaking hard i went deep within myself within humanity i thought about the anatomy of the human body how complex we are how amazing it is that our bodies function automatically i went deeper how did we come to be god didnt fucking put us here we are the product of shit happens there is no way that i am i what is i i lost my train of thought i lost my self awareness there was no way i could possibly exist no god put me here so that leaves evolution so i am the glorified product of some amino acids joining forces into the first proteins that assembled the first cell all the fucking way down the line thru trials and tribulations millions of years of evolution couldnt possibly yield something as complex as myself could it no there is no way that i could possibly exist and even if i did exist thru all the biochemical evolution that took place over the last couple million years there is absolutely no way i could become this intoxicated and still be alive i wasnt even intoxicated i was some different level comatose catatonic maybe alive i couldnt possible be in this state and still be alive i could feel what i thought to be my brain shutting down those poor abused neurons shutting down and shriveling up at the hands of this masterful powerful chemical wow what a critical analysis of reality

i opened my eyes and i couldnt see everything was white i could only see white after about 15 seconds my vision gradually came back i was gone helpless i literally thought i wasnt alive i got up and moved to a chair ok i was alive but how much longer till i slip away lsd has never killed anyone before will i be the first i felt like i was dying temporarily my friend asks if i am alright he knew i had taken more than him he was tripping balls but he was still lucid he did not realize i took 3 times the dose he did

he says i dont look so good i keep telling him i think i am alright i think i mentioned to him to keep an eye on me tho like in case i pass out or go unconscious

i keep thinking that this will be the end of my life my mom would have to live knowing her son died of a drug overdose i had to change things i grab a cigarette and go outside

oh my fuck fresh air night sky cigarette i start smoking and my trip settles down a little bit it is still overpowering but in a more bearable way now i am about 2 hours in i think i have an alright handle on it at this point i spend about 10 minutes just smoking cigarettes watching the starts dance watching the fir trees on the horizon sway gently in the summer breeze the trees branches were waving swirling sparkling lit
i go back inside amazing body high floating floating no body tension or load to speak of i lay down on the couch my friend throws on some floyd i throw a zebra print fleece blanket over me the acid really shifted gears on me at this point familiar music comfort body energy i look down and the black lines in the zebra print blanket were turning into snakes that were slithering up my body and over my shoulders i was totally at comfort i saw what appeared to be a dragon come slowly swirling out of the ceiling it looked chinese it slowly swirled around the room in a pleasing manor i have never actually seen a dragon while tripping until now i realized i was having my first breakthrough acid trip

i lay contemplating life watching the walls breath dance simmer like a mirage for a while as the acid once again shifts gears i entered the fractalgeometric visuals i watch as the most amazing molecular looking geometric pattern began to emerge from the ceiling it was backgrounded with shades of sunset purple redish pink and blue
these abstract and genuinely amazing unworldly visuals persisted for hours from this point we layed on the couches in his livingroom listening to music tripping out savoring the experience we would get up from time to time to take a wiz or have a smoke break around 6am we went out and smoked cigarettes as we watched the sun rise on acid 

it was truly an amazing night we had some amazing conversations talking about some of the most random and bizarre shit you could ever imagine some of the conversations were deep and philosophical

i was final satisfied i had finally had truly pure amazing lsd i hear people all the time on the internet and in real life saying i did 300 micrograms and it didnt do much or yeah i like to take 1500ug and trip ballz well buddy 1500ug of this shit would land your ass in a psych ward

i finally knew what timothy leary was preaching about i finally understood why william lenard pickard gave up his life to the law to make something that was illegal i finally understood why this stuff fueled a revolution of liberated thinking and free spiritedness i finally understood what lsd was all about finally

my trip didnt end until about 18 or so hours after dosing it just slowly tapered off it was an utter cluster fuck of mind and senses it really took weeks of processing what i am writing here is about half of it theres a lot more detail i could go into but i am getting tiered of typing i hope you got some incite about what real lsd is like i will never fuck with blotters again only crystal straight from the chemist made with love and care lsd is an amazing substance with vast potential to change our world to fucking bad it got labeled as a drug i still have a big chunk of that vial sitting waiting for just the right time to let it unleash its awesome potential

1025 pm  took 12 of one tab  just dissolved no effects yet  
  
1048 pm  slight dizzy feeling which quickly passed can taste the alcohol in my beer well considering taking 2nd half  
  
1107 pm  just took a hit of weed and effects are feeling slightly more intense starting to feel slightly anxious but still coherent glad i didnt take the second half  
  
1118 pm feeling euphoric listening to avey tare and kria brekken sounding very good thoughts are racing feeling jittery and wonderful  
  
its amazing i feel like i can hear my neurons firing in moments between songs i feel energetic but disoriented i can feel the electricity running through me i can feel the friction of my blood running i can hear the highfrequency drone of my energy my jaw is tense i have a slight headache my vision is slightly impaired sort of like seeing sparkles around everything very rapid and frequent thoughttraffic seeing tremendous beauty in mundane things  not sure if the drug is affecting me spiritually but i feel much more opened up  
musings
does music have any influence or effectiveness in the spiritual realm or is the significance purely personalemotional that is does music effect anything in the outside world aside from our own perception and how powerful is our own perception does music take on a life of its own after being released it seems as though all or most music goes beyond what is expected by its author in ways that can not most of the time be understood by the author him or herself because of the personal experience that listening is  
  
1147 pm  feeling slightly more stable thoughttraffic has slowed a little bit definitely feeling euphoric though it is not a perfect feeling as expected music is sounding so intricate can hear every detail physically not feeling 100 definitely the worst part of the trip for me back is sore headachy sort of stiff the nice mental aspects are far outweighing the negative physical aspects but would love to forgo the physical discomfort when the visual effects start to get intense i feel anxious comes in waves slightly seasick sort of feeling feels good to type this though  there is a certain comfort of expressing my thoughts even if it is just to myself definitely remembering the importance of feeling safe while tripping and understanding why new york can be an overwhelming place to trip seeing as one is never truly safe or alone which can be comforting in itself somehow  
  
1201 am  feeling pretty stable definitely high as helllllll though listening to coyote clean up   
  
1230 am  feeling good but the physical effects continue to worsen my overall very good experience listening to deerhunter definitely not as intimate as the music before but still working for me psychedelic effects and still a rough rock and roll edge really fucking good production lyrics to basement scene really hitting home for me right now

20.792412,12.368553,Addicted,"first time trying drugs 1g edibles and 46ug lsd bad trip
first off i just want to say that this is the first time me and my friends tried any real drug we had only tried nicotine and alcohol and since we thought that alcohol and marijuana had the same effects we were not scared 
we were only 16y old
the second thing is that where i live marijuana and lsd is illegal
sorry for my bad english
in this story im going to replace my friends names with tom and jerry 

so me and my friends decided that we should get into some soft drugs so we bought 1g hash each and some lsd and went to toms house it was pretty late in the evening so the first thing we did was splitting the lsd in three and then putting it in our mouths after 20mins we decided to go to the store and buy some snacks so we started walking and when we got there the lsd still had not dissolved so i started to rub it against the top of my mouth with my tounge and after a while it dissolved completely we drinks and some chips and then went home thats when tom said that we should make muffins out of the hash instead of smoking it but i said no since his parents would smell it but he just said that his mom is at work and his dad is asleep so i agreed and we started  following a recipe we found online while it was cooking jerry suddenly said omg and told me to lay down on the floor and look at the carpet so i laid down and saw that the stripes was moving a little and i yelled holy shit we calmed down after a while and started boiling the butter with the newly decarbed hash in it while it was cooking i hear jerry say someones pulling up in your driveway and i started laughing and said nice joke but thats when tom responded with oh fuck its my mom and i just freaked the fuck out and ran upstairs to toms room i heard talking downstairs and after a while i try to sneak  downstairs and peak into the kitchen but she sees me and says hi and i almost had a hearth attack but i responded and walked into the kitchen where i just sat down and shut up she tells tom that she is tired and walks upstairs i calm down and suddenly jerry walks out of the bathroom where he had hid tom walks into his backyard and picks up the pot with the hash and butter in it and we keep cooking after a while we start realising that we are forgetting everything we think about so we start writing it all down when the muffins are done we split them and get 4 each and that means there is 025g hash in each muffin we start with eating one each and wait an hour and since we dont feel anything we start eating another one and as soon as we finish it the first one kicks in and i freak out i look at tom and jerry and they ask me whats wrong but i was to confused to answer and i knew this was just the first one and that the second one will hit soon now this is where the fun begins i dont remember eating the last two muffins but i could definetly feel them i remember sitting in the sofa next to jerry while tom was at the other side of the sofa yelling and freaking out he started saying stuff that didnt make any sense but that i could still understand somehow and then he started looping which really turned this trip into a bad trip he started repeating himself over and over and when he realised he was looping back he would scream really loud and then continue looping after a while he came to the conclusion that it was the drugs fault and he started yelling something like this i need to get the drugs out of my system how do i do that i go to sleep how do i go to sleep a hard hit to the head i need to put myself to sleep and he started repeating that which made me sxared for his life and i tried to calm the situation but i was to fucked after a while he walked into the bathroom and started puking and thats when my body started looping my body started walking from the living room past tom in the bathroom where he would yell at me to get his parents and i would just say yes yes yes then it would go to the kitchen where it would take a sip of water and then go into the backyard where jerry was he was just standing completely quiet while looking at the stars and i would say hey and bob my head and he would do the same thing to me this was happening automatically and i had no control over it and it happend like 10 times the last time i went on the loop i walked to the bathroom where tom yelled at me to get his parents while at the same time stickinga a wodden stick down his throat to puke but this time he didnt trust me to get his parents so he started walking up the stairs while yelling mom mom when he got up the stairs his mom walked out toms parents room and whispered what is it since his dad was asleep tom stared her in the eyes for a solid 5 sec before suddenly sticking the stick down his throat and throwing up all over the floor between them and thats when i knew we where fucked i went back outside and told jerry that toms parents know and he just kinda smiled and said mhm and then continoud looking at the stars so i walked back in and when i got upstairs his mom was asking him what we took but he was completely freaking out so i told her fortysix ug lsd four six lsd and a litlle weed and then tom says to his mom please tell me it is over soon while totally freaking out and she says it says it lasts for six hours so you better buckle up which made him freak out even more and i started saying no only happy thoughts to his mom and she was really confused she took tom downstairs to the sofa and calmed him down and tom told me to put something on but i was struggling alot but eventually i managed to put on some anti drug video and i didnt realize what i had done until both me and tom was freaking out again so i turned it off and walked out of the room while toms mom was trying to calm him down and i got stuck in the loop again after about 7 laps around the living room kitchen and backyard his mom told me to go get jerry so i went to the backyard and told him to come inside and she got us all blankets finally we were all in the sofa watching a music video and calming down thats when i realized the colours and visuals going on all over my fov and it was crazy beatiful thats when i closed my eyes and when on a crazy adventure inside my mind that i cant explain and thats the end of this trip report
alot of more weird stuff happend but i dont know how to explain it all
i found out the next morning that the music video was actually  just a normal picture"
13.790338,16.230804,Addicted,"sober psychedelic experience first isolation tank 60minutes
i know this is atypical for the sub so ill explain what i did and to my best knowledge why i experienced what i experienced

so what did i do 

full stomach bit of coffee an hour previous but otherwise sober for 60 minutes i stayed in a pitch black room filled to my knees with a highly dense body temperature water its possible to lay on your back and effortlessly float in order to experience almost full sensory deprivation if you havent heard about this before what this resulted in was visual hallucinations while i meditated with my eyes open to make sure that i didnt fall asleep

so what happened

at first i saw patterns dark colors and nonsensical shapes but as time went on these shapes became more real i was startled by a messyhaired woman who kept looming over me she seemed accusatory and my thoughts turned to what i was doing wrong in my life as my guilt was rising i sat up to dispel that woman when i did the ceiling opened to an intensely bright blue sky that caused the darkness that it touched to swirl and undulate giant faceless figures of light stood outside calling to me encouraging me with outstretched hands it wasnt that i heard their voicesive experienced auditory hallucinations beforeinstead i knew their thoughts it was a peaceful and extremely vivid experience

as the light faded i returned to my dark surroundings and stepped out of the tank five minutes before my time was up it makes me wonder what will happen when i do it with some pot next time"
16.737123,15.3443575,Addicted,"my subconscience and my ego meet
anybody that has not tripped before may have trouble understanding what i’m about to discuss fellow trippers can vouch for the fact that once lsd comes into your life a key turns in your brain and the world looks forever if subtly different this is my experience of unknowingly taking a journey deep within myself forgetting that i was still “me” and meeting who my ego is at my core while it was difficult to understand initially my life changed forever in a positive direction 

there was a time in my life that i would live day by day pondering my reason for existence life was good but felt empty life experience in the past made it often difficult for me to like myself and be content but i had every reason in the world to live in the positivity i never really allowed myself to think about these things that i’d let weigh me down for so many years i was existing and doing “well” but still felt so complacent and lost there were so many questions that i had yet i didn’t quite know how to ask them 

a friend who had recently met lucy asked if i’d also like to meet her i’d smoked weed before but never quite was brave enough or nearby enough to them for that matter to try psychedelics “sure” i said “let’s give it a shot”

400ug and about 15 hours later and lift off 

the come up was interesting but then again so was everything else i was so moved and couldn’t understand why i started seeing beauty though i couldn’t explain how language started feeling so empty because it couldn’t come close to describing this sense of infinite connection that i was having with the universe and my fellow trippers i was with my two closest friends and the girlfriend i would end up marrying she served as trip sitter we stood on my balcony in the evening and watched the forest in front of us evolve into this fractal part of eternity rays of light were transforming into sacred geometry and music was absolutely just owning me as a musician i’d been aware of the psychedelic relation to music but never truly experienced it the music became me and i became the music 

i remember one moment listening to death cab for cutie’s song transatlanticism and being so overwhelmingly moved when i looked at my girlfriend and i knew at that moment she would be with me forever i’d been planning my proposal at the time at that thought a lyric in the song said “i need you so much closer” as though my spirit had spoken that to her my universe was piecing together and showing me a new reality 

my friends and i all sat on my floor in the living room and had this immensely deep conversation where there was a palpable sense of friendship vibrating through the room as if all of history was dependent upon us three being friends at this moment as if the universe itself ordained this moment for us to feel so connected as friends we could physically feel the warmth of friendship radiating in this conversation even our reflections in the sliding glass doors agreed that we needed to all be there at that moment 

as the peak ended i foolishly thought my trip was over after about 34 hours having no experience with lucy before my girlfriend and i decided to take a shower and hit the bed i don’t recall any visuals or out of the ordinary experiences and was pretty well convinced that this trip was over my lady and i had sex which completely shattered my world but i just told myself it must just be the endorphins from coming down after what would end up being one of the most passionate experiences in my whole life we kissed and laid on our sides of the bed to sleep 

this is where it gets crazy

i am a belly sleeper i closed my eyes hugged my pillow and laid still all of the sudden my soul feels like it’s falling there was no distinct moment or change that indicated this was to come but i was no longer a version of myself that remembers his life i was definitely me but had no memories i don’t know any other way to say it than to say “i was just” i existed but no longer in what i interpret to be the conventional sense i end up in this dark abyss nothing but blackness no floor no sky no body 

my spirit starts heading toward something it notices in the distance millions of miles away i willed myself closer to it and i eventually come upon my body standing up waiting for me the only way i can describe this part is using a fight club analogy it was like being edward norton’s character without having a body and meeting brad pitt’s character tyler durden i saw this person that was me he sounded exactly like my own voice when listened through a recording device i saw myself the way a person having a conversation with me sees me this guy knew everything about me he held the knowledge to every single insecurity and memory i had he seemed evil but familiar 

he is talking to me but i don’t have a body he would speak i would respond telepathically he began to tell me everything i hated about myself it was like speaking exclusively to the devil on your shoulder he’d say what a pathetic person i was rub my guiltiness earned from a life of being a human being with mistakes in my face and projected my worries about living on me he discredited my close friends and the way they see me he told me constantly that my girlfriend would leave me when she saw who i truly was he told me that no matter how much i begged god for forgiveness i was deserving of suffering torture and hell 

my spirit began to feel frustrated angry and helpless it was able to respond to everything my ego said but his argument was always better than my spirit’s was eventually after what felt like hours my ego started goading me “you finally see how useless you are” “everybody else sees you this way it’s about time you figured it out” “you deserved all of your suffering” finally he said this “you want to die don’t you”

my spirit had enough it screamed with human language at my ego and said “no i don’t want to die” the blackness snapped down the middle of my spirit’s vision my ego vanished into patterns that were now breaking the blackness and engulfing everything as the black abyss was vanishing it began to vanish inwards toward what felt to be my chest and body as if they’d joined again i felt something try to grab me by the ribcage and pull me back into the abyss through my bed it was like giant hand claws the adrenaline in my human body shot through my whole being and i woke up on my knees having pushed my hands so hard into the mattress from trying so hard to get away from the claws my girlfriend looked at my very puzzled and i’d felt like i saw her in a different more unified light 

as i woke up i had this huge realization my spirit and ego were in a conflict that i didn’t even know was there this argument of self seemed to build a bridge that made me feel like a more complete human i understood myself i’d realized that i plunged the depths of me and confronted my issues every single one i wanted to live 

i never sought out to have an experience like that but any time lucy and i have met since then she has reminded me of the resolve i made that evening and to continue forward in some way shape or form that experience literally taught me how to better understand myself and made me realize that i can’t take life at face value selfexamination is so important for a person and their health lucy taught me how to better understand that part of myself and i’ve since been a more unified me "
12.668063,15.307005,Addicted,"meditation  mushrooms
hello everyone i just wanted to throw this here and tell you guys what’s been working great for me every time i take shrooms even with lemon tech i make it a point to sit and meditate for at least a third of my trip i have many wonderful experiences like this including meeting entities 

this last shroom trip i took 25 g if cubensies and went right to a tree in my front yard and started meditation and waited for them to hit i sat for about 25 minutes before i started really feeling it 

this trip took me into a deep hole it was dark and i was looking for light anywhere and then i saw it from miles above there was one single spot of light with a rope hanging from the heavens leading into it to the ground i started to climb the rope and this was a very tiring experience my mind and body started to feel strained but i proceeded until i made it to the top 

when i finally made it out of the hole i was face to “face” with this being this being had an inverted triangular head and on each side of its head it had three eyes nine in total this being was beautifully lit up with a gold and platinum light emanating from deep within it and shining so brightly it was almost unbearable this being came to meat this point i was very aware of my third eye and took its fingers and opened my third eye after opening my third eye it spat inside of it and told me “though your eye is open you must still learn to see through it” after this i floated back down into my body 

this was by far the most enlightening part of my trip after i awakened from my meditation i went outside and laid under the stars for hours laying under the stars i remembered that mushrooms help us become one with the earth and it’s always awesome to experience that unity even if it’s only for a moment "

some background information this happened a few years ago when i was 18 i took some really strong acid with my cousin two hits each and my other cousin which was sober would periodically write down what i said into my notebook i should note that althought i had read up on lsd and its risks i had no idea what to expect from the experience itself so i was pretty much blown away by it in an awesome way anyway here it is

acid was taken at 1th may 2200 pm


2300 pm people keep changing colors but the dark colors dont change i can still talk properly


0000 am colors are changing in a brutal fashion and i dont feel my body everything seems to be fleeting and transparent sometimes as if i can see through it including people i can still talk properly


0023 am time is flowing really slowly i feel as if i am outside of my body and into another dimension as if my mind and my body are separated i cannot distinguish colors and when i close my eyes i see shapes and patterns


0031 am i closed my eyes and i saw something really weird there was a piramid witrh an eye on it resembling the one on the dollar bill suddently the pyramid dissapeared and the eye became the eye of horus then the pyramid appeared again and the eye became part of it again it wasnt the eye of horus anymore


0124 am  time is flowing really slowly and i still cannot distinguish colors i can still talk normally to people but i am having trouble in communicating my experience i will go out of my cousins house and into the streets later i dont feel my body at all


625 am  the sun is gonna come out soon i dont feel like i am outside of my body anymore and i realize i am hungry so i am going on the streets to get some food but first i will watch the sunrise and smoke a joint


704 am  i just came back when i was watching the sun rising i suddently recovered my perception of colors and so did my cousin at the same time when that happened every color seemed really intense and the day seemed beautiful i never appreciated the beauty of the world like i did in this moment

15.575074,14.207544,Addicted,"meeting my self 5 dried grams of magic mushrooms while meditating in silent darkness
meeting my self—3 dried grams of psilocybe subaeruginosa equivalent to 5 grams of psilocybe cubensis while meditating in silent darkness 

last night i decided to finally attempt the famous terrence mckenna 5 grams in silent darkness trip for the first time it would end up being by far the most intense trip of my life here is my story 

my previous trip about a month ago was the first time i had ever tripped alone and i spent the bulk of the trip in my silent bedroom with my eyes covered lying in bed although this dosage was just 21 grams equivalent to 33 grams of p cubensis i also spent most of that trip writhing and wriggling in my bed and getting up to go to the toilet three or so times i found that trip to be a success given i was able to get through it without any fear or anxiety—a feat which i had only been able to achieve for the first time earlier this year on an even lower dose my goal for my next trip was to do the full 3 grams and also to see if i could keep my body perfectly still and relaxed throughout the trip i got this idea from listening to interviews with martin ball who in his experience in administering and guiding 5meodmt trips says he has observed trippers twisting their bodies into asymmetrical positions when their ego is clinging on and resisting the breakthrough and encouraged his clients to try to maintain a relaxed symmetrical body position through the trip—a kind of physical way to surrender to the experience in addition to the mental surrendering which is so crucial so i had a goal to spend the entire trip lying on my back in my bed with my arms lying relaxed to the sides of my torso i also got the idea from martin ball that having your arms covering your chest is a defensive protective position and so having the chest open and exposed is further conducive to the physical surrender 

so i gulped down my shroom tea in about 30 seconds got into this relaxed position in bed covered my eyes and began to try to get into a meditative state—noticing my thoughts feelings and bodily sensations and observing them as they arrived and left in waves i believe this meditation technique is called vipassana and i have been practicing it infrequently for 34 months the crucial part of this kind of meditation is to be committed to staying still—to resist the urges to move or get up that the mind constantly generates i was able to maintain this still position for the first 2 and a half hours of the trip 

the comeup was fast and extremely intense the first feelings i noticed about 10 minutes after drinking the tea were waves of energy and pressure that suddenly swept through my body the sensations were kind of like heat or a physical pushing and they quickly started to come more frequently and more intensely soon after this my first visual perceptions began accompanied by much stronger waves of the physical energy sweeping more and more rapidly and forcefully through my body my visuals consisted of a range of solidlycoloured subdued fluorescent pink green yellow solid black and white tessellated geometric shapes rotating stretching and contorting amongst themselves and corresponding with the waves of physical pressure and energy sweeping through my body as this intensified i had the sensation that these shapes were squashing stretching and twisting my body and head like a baker kneading dough i also had the sense that i was lying on a kind of operating table looking up at these kind of alienesque shapeentities that were crushing my body and head then passing me onto the next set of alienesque shapeentities to do more contorting although this was a very intense experience i knew i was safe and so i surrendered to these shapeentities and let them do whatever they wanted to me 

this period of the trip seemed to last about 30 minutes and eventually the intense physical waves of energy seemed to subside and the speed and ferocity of my visuals subdued this marked the start of the main body of the trip which was marked by a range of feelings revelations and experiences the order of which is difficult to recall the first main feeling i can recall was this sense that objectivity and subjectivity were not distinct anymore i could not really identify as an entity or a being that was separate from anything external to me it felt as if being was just this one phenomenon which encapsulated the entire gamut of possible experience—that there was no difference between me and not me between what i did and what happened to me my sense of agency was completely gone the only thing i could be sure about was that something was happening it was also quite extraordinary to comprehend that even in this incredible state the volume or intensity of awareness or consciousness seemed the same as a regular sober state or the state on any kind of other drug i have experienced there was basically the present moment—which i was aware of—the contents of which would evolve moment to moment but which could never become more full or more empty even the lack of a feeling or sensation in a given moment was offset by space which itself had the same volume as any sensation or feeling that might have been there i interpret this now as the idea that consciousness is always complete it never needs anything more and never has too much it is steady and eternal each moment is perfect and whole regardless of its contents 

this experience led me to begin to question—what am i my ideas that i have previously always had about who i am pretty much all depended on the idea that i was distinct from the external world—that i was an entity that interacted with things that werent me other people objects etc now with the idea of my separateness from the world inaccessible nonsensical and incomprehensible i had almost nothing to go off to answer my question who the hell am i 

all i could be sure of in this state was that something was happening i was having thoughts feelings sensations and visual and auditory perceptions there was not nothing quite the opposite there was everything and i started to realise that there always has been everything every single experience thought emotion and feeling i have ever had which now are only accessible to me in the form of memories i had that is to say the only thing i can possibly be sure about is that they happened and i experienced them what a revelation what i am must be the very awareness or consciousness that has experienced and been witness to every single thing that has ever happened to me i am not the idea i have about who i am one might call this the ego that idea is simply a pattern of thought that has been repeating for my entire life and fooling me into believing in its existence and reality what i actually am is an awareness a consciousness that has existed for eternity as far as i can perceive given i don’t remember the start of my existence which has been the witness to my thoughts feelings and senseperceptions for my entire life how have i never realised this until now it became suddenly very clear to me that my ego or my idea of who i am doesn’t really exist i found out who i truly am for the first time in my life 

after this incredible realisation a lot of tension became released from my body that i didnt notice i was holding i had just come face to face with my actual true self—my pure consciousness i had finally broken through my mind which had been preventing me from encountering my pure essence for my whole life suddenly my experience became very soft and delicate i had let down every single guard from my pure being and exposed my self to itself for the first time ever it was so fragile and vulnerable it was very cautious of letting me get close to it—afraid of what might happen to it now that it had no protection whatsoever my body had become extremely relaxed and utterly limp perhaps it had lost tension that it had been holding onto for years even decades i saw my pure vulnerable exposed self—so shy and nervous i realised what a profound moment this was i was meeting my true self for the first time i felt an immense care and love for my shy vulnerable self all it wanted was to love and to be loved and i loved it i approached it very slowly so i could get closer to it without scaring it i began to touch it lovingly caringly slowly making sure that it was feeling safe and comfortable with the amount of contact which was more than had ever been made it was a very similar experience to the most loving and caring kind of lovemaking where two people are completely engaged and completely present with each other and every move each one makes is determined by how the other receives and accepts it my pure self was letting me meet it letting me into its most vulnerable space and accepting me it embraced me i had earned its trust and i was able to get closer to it than anyone had ever gotten i effectively met my self and made love with it it was possibly the most beautiful and powerful experience of life 

i opened my eyes and wriggled my fingers and toes around this point and took in some deep euphoric breaths as i reconnected to my surroundings this was probably about 2 and half hours after consumption and i was seeing a quadrupled kaleidoscope of my ceiling—some of the heaviest openeye visuals i have ever had which seemed to be a predictable level considering the profundity of what i had just experienced i lay for a while watching the ceiling with my arms out like a starfish breathing deeply basking in the beauty and glory of my existence and what had just happened to me a phrase came to my mind and i couldnt stop repeating it you are your home what this meant to me was that no matter where you are physically and whomever you are with you are always with your self your self is your home you should love your self you should get to know your self because it is the only thing that has always been with you and always will be to not know your self is to live a life of distraction and illusion and to not care for and love your self is to harm your self—to disrespect your only home your eternal home i got out of bed and wrote on a piece of paper so i wouldnt forget these messages—you are your home and beneath you have been here through everything that has ever happened to you the second phrase i very carefully crafted to try to embody the insight i had about what my true self is in a way that i could interpret in a sober state i intended it to cut through the idea of my self the ego which my mind continually perpetuates which changes and evolves in content and quality over time in contrast to my true self my pure consciousnessawareness which is always steady and whole and always has been despite my inability to recognize it for my whole life with the bulk of the trip over i rode out the final couple of hours of the comedown listening to music with my housemate 

this experience has been an enormous milestone in my personal journey and has lent credence to many inklings i have been having since i began paying closer attention to the contents of my mind about a year ago i never really understood how one can have a relationship with oneself so viscerally until now and i have a renewed sense of awe for my life

this story starts when i was 19 years old was fairly experienced with lsd and a few other psychedelics me and my best friend at the time well call him chris had been tripping quite a bit on the weekends this weekend we were informed that his parents would be gone the whole week leaving us a mansion to trip in with an infinite amount of possibility i was addicted to opiates at the time and was using around a half gram a day snorted of heroin after dosing and taking the boy around the same time i had no desire to redose which is very unlike me 

we discussed inviting over our girlfriends tho decided that because we wanted to go as far down the rabbit hole as mentally possible it would be for the best if they didnt come 

fast forward to friday after school were flying down the highway to acquire the doses we get there expecting him to have tabs instead he has two different vials one for me one for my buddy with around 1400 micrograms in each vial originally my plan was only to take around 400ug so thats what i did i took what i eyeballed very risky and stupid decision here to be around 4 doses i used an eye dropper and put the tasteless liquid under my tongue it felt like a drop of water but i knew what i was in store for 

my tongue started tingling this is where it really begins 

t  015 im starting to feel something though it could simply be placebo my hands are getting cold and a tingling sensation is surging through my body like tiny little lightning bolts 

t  030 were almost home tho im tripping balls my friend wanted to wait till he got home to trip though i didnt want to wait so i took part of my dose right away before driving back home i remember feeling like i was playing a car driving simulator on the old school gameboy everything had a very electric vibe to it i could hear a car horn from a mile away i swear 

t  100 im tripping a little too hard at this point my friend even can tell im having a rough time im not really communicating well at all and have retreated to an empty room to try to figure out why im feeling how im feeling i convince myself that what i was doing was wrong and that my girlfriend would inevitably break up with me if she knew this sent me down a weird path i caught myself before going too deep grabbed an orange walked into the kitchen threw it at my friend and exclaimed im all better now dont ask me why i threw the orange throwing fruit around seems to be a habit of mine and my friends on acid im smiling just recalling this 

t  130 we are now doing what we normally do while on doses listening to infected mushroom converting vegetarians its sending me to a different place a much more visually distorting place me and my friend giggle like two school girls for what seems like hours we decide to go on a walk in the woods outside his house the trees seem to breath with us for a moment we feel almost telepathically connected to nature it was a surreal and beautiful feeling 

t  200 we head back inside to smoke a joint this is when my peak had just started the visuals at this point were all moving with each other the rooms of he house all seemed to be morphing together to create just one giant room i remember all of a sudden my phone ringing which is odd generally i turn it on airplane mode when taking acid its my girlfriend i answer the phone and to my surprise after admitting i was tripping balls in my underwear at chris house she laughed and told me to have a great night and to text her letting her know im doing alright later that night i was completely dumbfounded she never responds this way to my drug use something came over me a feeling that is hard to describe where i felt invincible and wanted to take things as far as possible 

t  300 at this point the time of events is a guessing game i took what was left of my vial in the refrigerator and put it all in my mouth i dont know if i was feeling suicidal in the sense that i had nothing to live for or invincible where i felt nothing could touch me maybe a bit of both

t  330 this is really bad im starting to lose track of who i am and where i am me and my friend are mindlessly wandering around only to find each other and be super happy that the other person was there time distortion is becoming more and more apparent i cant seem to keep track of anything anymore i give into it i take a deep breath and accept the death of my ego all of a sudden a new wave of electric tactile sensations surges through my body 

t  430 i am a glass of orange juice so far thats the only thing im really sure of acidic orange juicy and i come from a fruit idk man i think orange juice isnt the worst thing a boy could be tho it seems im okay with that i throw another orange at my friend he giggles then returns fire we both laugh then cry then laugh more wondering why were crying we both talk about how lsd is by far the best chemical weve ever put into our bodies then go to different rooms again to explore further 

t  500 there is no me anymore until later into the story no longer an i component all of me has melted into a puddle and has been swept away i am everything and everything is me i feel an interconnectedness to everything and everyone around me a level of empathy i wasnt ready for i felt their pain i felt natures pain i felt my own my visuals were insane at this point almost too much the house was collapsing all around me and then being rebuilt i took a bath for some reason and ended up thinking i was lost in an ocean my mind was creating these wild scenarios and it would then fill in the blanks crazy 

t  1000 a good amount of time has gone by and im still tripping balls wonder if itll ever end its getting to the point where im tired and want to sleep but know sleep is no where near achievable in my current state maybe later 

t 1700 still tripping starting to worry about hppd my teenage mind is going in a million different directions finally i ask my friend for a benzo he gives me 5 xanax i fall asleep about an hour later tho the benzo didnt do much 

this is a story about 6 years ago about a boy who didnt understand what lsd had to offer was incredibly careless and could give a shit whether he lived or died i wasnt even completely depressed it was more of a i dont care type feel i have found ways to feel more empathy towards other after this trip and started taking care of myself more 

i wish i could tell you it gave me this pronounced inside of myself at 19 but the only thing i know for sure is that im a glass of orange juice 

love and peace everyone

14.922306,13.637906,Addicted,"had the best trip of my life yesterday
so yesterday morning my partner and i each dropped 150ug and went on a hike in the rocky mountains which led us to a beautiful clearing surrounded by miles of forest in any direction and an absolutely gorgeous unobstructed view of the peaks at breckenridge we spent about four hours in a 20x20 ft square within the field wandering around some before finally laying down on the ground using our backpacks as pillows aside from a brief moment of panic and unease when i realized that one of the beer cans in my backpack had burst crushed between the weight of my head and the rock underneath it this was an absolutely incredible and insane experience i am not one to typically experience intense visuals on psychedelics although i definitely have a more pronounced visual trip on psilocybin but this was unlike anything i have ever experienced i felt as though my body was being absorbed into the earth below me and the clouds which initially looked like neurons that were morphing and multiplying before my eyes eventually took on a kaleidoscopic pattern containing allseeing eyes and visions of hindu goddesses this was by far the most intense peak ive ever experienced and im a bit disappointed that i pulled myself out of it as it was getting really allencompassing because i think i was on the verge of ego death which i have only experienced once before on a very difficult and unpleasant trip this time however the gradual dissolution of my sense of self was deeply comforting rather than disconcerting shortly after this we headed back to where we were staying and i put on the first john prine record and related to every lyric so heavily that i sat and cried for at least an hour because i was finally able to work through a lot of unresolved grief that i never allowed myself to fully process following the overdose death of a childhood friend back in december i felt such profound acceptance and peace despite the fact that i was crying tears of sadness the bulk of the trip only lasted about 7 hours though the afterglow persisted for at least another five we spent the afterglow at an incredible mexican restaurant within walking distance of our place talking about the sense of beauty and acceptance that we had both rediscovered during the trip overlooking a pristine mountain stream with kids playing and people fishing it was so incredible and im still at a loss for words i really think it might have been the best day of my entire life i feel kinda corny saying this but i truly love lsd"
16.890965,12.824406,Addicted,"lsd trip and spiritual awakening
hello everyone before i get started i would like to share a little backstory about myself im a college student and for about 6 months now ive been experimenting with psychedelics and have done everything from shrooms lsd 25inbome ketamine mxe dxm mdma salvia and smoke pot everyday so i wasnt that unaccustomed to psychedelics and after having many ego destroying moments over the course of those months and i was becoming more comfortable with myself and more confident as a person i also opened my third eye following an obe i had on dxm and i started to pursue full self enlightenment and thats when my life pretty much changed forever 

so one day following 3rd plateau dxm trip me and my friend who i will refer to as x picked up 2 sheets of high quality lsd when got back to the room we decided to smoke a few bowls of salvia 25x and wait for my other friends to come so we could sell them 2 strips of lsd eventually the two kids showed up for the strips and my friend x who was still a little wonked out by the salvia misunderstood them and cut out two huge ass tabs for them instead of strips these things mustve been the size of 4 to 5 normal sized tabs after a good laugh x cut them their strips and they left but we were both stuck with these oversized tabs of lsd 

both me and x had a bit of experience in the past with lsd so we thought it was a good opportunity to test the quality so we both stuck the tab on our tongues and braced for impact before when i did lsd i remember my come up being pretty slow and not feeling anything for a good 45 mins to an hour of taking the tabs nope a few mins after dropping i could feel the energy from the tab flowing through my body now i was a little worried i mightve taken a bit too much lsd but i was in good company there was x and xs roommate who well call d and i know that there was the kids that we sold the lsd to already dropped an hour or so ago so i was pretty much ready for what was in store or so i thought so in the mean time we played super smash as me and x waited for it to fully take effect

the lsd was gradually taking effect as i was getting fantastic tracers and the familiar fractalizing visuals i was accustomed to with lsd but it had only been 30 minutes and im tripping as hard as i was 2 hrs into my previous lsd escapades as i was sitting playing super smash when all of a sudden i felt it really start to hit me as i pretty much cant play video games anymore and throw the controller away and run over to the computer to look up some music to play to keep myself centered as i can feel myself becoming more and more out of touch with reality i put on some crystal castles and a few minutes later i completely lose touch with reality and everything associated with it it feels as though my body was completely destroyed as disassembled like every atom of my body separated from one another i had no concept of the self i was just an entity a being just a drop in the swimming pool we call our consciousness i felt reunited like i belonged here and i was convinced that i had died i was sad i was leaving my family behind but i was happy when i realized that we would all be reunited one day and to wait out their deaths so we could be one forever i was free free from the burden of humanity i felt all my past memories melt away and i wasnt any one thing i was everything i became a fractal ever expanding and all encompassing and all knowing i realized that this fractal is pure consciousness which is also what i interpret as being god and i am part of him as is everyone else on earth and we are one and we are all being 

i then saw my body from the outside and what looked like an alex grey painting and i constantly went from looking at my body from the outside and then rejoining my body as i weaved throughout myself as i surfed the very fabric of time as it repieced the memories associated with the trip into my psyche i relived these events but through the lens of an observer that was not the person living the events i felt like i was on autopilot as my body was doing things but my mind was trying to make sense of what i was doing everyone was looking at me strangely as i basically made a fool of myself acting like an idiot but i didnt care and neither did x who i feel like we have a connection and would consider one of my only true friends i felt as though i knew everyones thoughts and that the people laughing at my expense dont understand the true beauty of lsd and that they use it to just get fucked up and care so much about how they act on it and people are so caught up in how others think of them that they dont take time to care about what you think about yourself 

during the trip as i would return back into my body i tried to leave messages to my friends to tell them what is going on and the profound messages i was receiving from the other realm i run to the computer and type we are all part of a universal consciousness that is pure love but no matter what or how you convey that to other people they will never know thats all i could type as i then was ripped again out of my body and thrown into many other scenarios where i feel as though im trying to convey this all to x as we are lost in the woods in the dark and theres a 10 inches of snow on the ground and trying to find our way home as were laughing and having the best time of my life i cant stop laughing im laughing at the sheer absurdity of life and how life here is a just a joke after the trip when i finally completely regained consciousness and tried to piece this all together it was so profound that i was anything at all and so humbled that i was and that i ignored this and my own divinity all my life it was enough to make me cry for hours but not tears of sadness it was tears of joy that i simply am much like in the old testament when yahweh says i am that i am i also realized that lsd and other psychedelics are on this earth as a tool for humans to realize their true divine nature

well if you got to the end thanks for reading "
13.067433,13.126131,Addicted,"monthly solo trip
its been 3 months since i started an experiment ive been tripping in nature by myself about once a month i live in marquette michigan us and the nature around here is pristine its a time for me to reevaluate myself and the reality around me i started doing this purely out of curiosity my life is generally pretty good and im happy but im always looking for a deeper understanding of life and who i really am nature photography is an important hobby of mine and i love to document my journeys through the woods in that way i also bring a trip journal out and record any important thoughts

yesterday was my third solo trip i arrived in the morning around 10am a beautiful place called harlow lake my plan was to walk around the lake for a while then go up a ridge line and chill on a mountain peak i knew of up there i eat one big ass shroom weighing 24g and began my journey after that i put my phone away so all the time from here on are approximate i made my way to a rocky little peninsula on the lake and sat down to wait for the effects to kick in i pass the time taking pictures of whatever interests me some fish along the shore a heron by the swamp after more than an hour i still wasnt feeling much just the usually kind of shakystoned feeling but not tripping i knew then and there that this would be a gentle ride but there was still more to come 

i decided a change of scenery was in order and made my way for the mountain peak about halfway to the top it was getting pretty hot and i sought shelter in a shaded area to record some thoughts in my trip log by now the shrooms had pretty much kicked in no crazy visuals but i was in an entirely different head space i felt entirely alone its hard to explain but i couldnt even feel my own presence i was just an observer free to explore anywhere as i wrote in my journal i didnt see my hands writing the words were just being written on the page i heard some shuffling in the leaves next to me and i looked up to see a pine martin checking me out i watched him approach me i could feel his curiosity as he slunk silently under the leafy plants on the ground ive never seen one of these up close and it was hard to contain my excitement of course my camera was just out of reach and i got up as slowly and quietly as possible to my surprise he didnt seem to care when i got up he just casually hobbled along in the other direction i followed him for a while and got at least one decent picture 

now it was time to make my way to the top i didnt turn around to look at the view until i made it to the highest point when i did it was absolutely humbling its a wide panoramic view of the rugged landscape as it meets lake superior i had been up on this hill at least 10 times before but it felt like i was seeing this view for the first time with infinitely more detail than i had remembered i just stood there for a good 15 minutes analyzing the massive landscape in front of me each hill tree rock outcrop body of water was entirely unique i wrote down if im able to bring back 10 of what i felt today it will be a success eventually i found a nice shady spot to set up my hammock and chill out during a very comfortable come down 

today im totally back to normal physically and much more grounded mentally theres something about nature that is incredibly healthy for our psyche and we could all benefit just by spending more time outside

if anyone is interested some of those pictures can be seen here the pictures from this trip are the 9 most recent ones on my profile thanks for reading url"

i will preface this by saying that i have had numerous experiences with psychedelics and dissociatives this was however my first experience with lsd


i had had numerous experiences tripping with other people and although the social loops where often entertaining i found myself unable to complete delve into the trip i wanted to have one last trip the one trip to rule them all


i finished my paper and took two tabs of acid i bumped the ketamine in careful doses over the course of the trip and took the nbome when i wanted to completely melt into the blackness this was to be an extraordinary journey from which i would not be able to escape primarily because my friend had taken my keys without me noticing and i didnt want to call people at 3 am with a head full of acid having lost my keys


i closed the lights and put a mattress in my living room i fed the cats and put on an 8 hour long playlist consisting largely of apollo by brian eno and stars of the lid
when i finally did take the last bump of ketamine closed my eyes and lied down i could feel myself falling through multiple layers of soft enveloping blackness i forgot myself and experienced suffering and joy thousandfold


the trip jumped through time and space and i saw numerous scenarios playing themselves out around me i experienced killing native americans with a colt from horseback and having my children killed by white skinned invaders with strange weapons i didnt understand
i was both the perpetrator and victim of every single act of evil but also of every act of kindness
i saw the girl i fancy being shredded in half by a circular and i saw pows returning to their families


i felt like i was rocking a newborn with my left hand and hunting slaves with a rusty spear with my right i experienced countless events from all across history all playing themselves out with me in the middle of them human nature showed all of its faces to me i felt like i understood no longer did i feel part of some small brotherhood of people with whom i could relate people like me but instead with all of humanity with this extraordinary species with all of our pain and malice kindness and joy across history the drops of causality the actions of every single human being had made the well stir in that exact fashion that created me


i could see at my feet what i can only describe as a giant black vaginaflower through the floors i could see the flowers of the people in my apartment and i could see the tubes the tubes that led to the singularity which manifested itself as a giant tree i knew that everything was a result of everything else


towards the end my brain let me have one single scene of pure unadulterated awesomeness void of any imminent philosophical implications
i was standing on top of a cliff at the bottom of which only a few feet of sand separated the almost vertical wall from the ocean i looked out over the endless waves and from behind the sun an eagle appeared i drew the string of a bow i didnt know i had kyodo style of course holding the bow above my head pulling it down and drawing the string and then releasing all in one swift motion the arrow flew and it was as if the air held its breath in anticipation while mid air i felt the gravity of the world shift towards the arrow suddenly the cliff was horizontal immediately acknowledging this i jumped into a diving position speeding through the air at terminal velocity the arrow pierced the heart of the eagle only a split second before i caught it holding the eagle and the arrow my ballistic arch gradually fell and i broke through the surface of the ocean barely stirring the surface and still holding my prey"

wow all i can say is 1010 would trip again i dont know how much detail i should put in this trip report but i guess ill just summarize my feelings during the experience my guy shorted my about 7 and i made a mistake of eating 5 lemon tekkedis that right haha a few days back which i shouldve definitely saved so i ended up having 23 just straight up

i took them around 1215 and went to the nearby trail so my friend could smoke a bowl we sit down and i await the oncoming experience but i wasnt expecting anything just waiting for it to show me the way i guess the first alert was around 100 my senses started getting a little heightened not much by 115 i have this sense of unity with the trees around me and i can feel the life force of the planet it was really amazing i look up to see the clouds and holy shit they look like the most beautiful things ive seen

by 130 we start to head back to my place to just chill because its really hot outside its just pure awe life feels vibrant glowing with love and happiness it feels as if my eyes tune into a different frequency or something because i really appreciate the natural beauty of the world i was fully in control however i was longboarding down my hill to my house and i have a moment where it feels like the hill just didnt end for a while we go to my house and we sneak in through the basement and we just chill for the next 2 and a half hours 

wemostly my friend watched american pie as my sense of time is really fucking distorted i wanted to really experience some visuals so i did what i read makes you see a lot and turned off the lights pretty cool i guess my dosage wasnt high enough that i saw too many oev occasional wavyness or breathing of the room a lot of epiphanies popped through my head and i learned a lot some details too personal to share but basically it really showed me some things i needed to change in my life or appreciate a lot more than i did

9.324048,12.364111,Addicted,"lsd and the oculus fun times indeed
cross post from riftintothemind

spent some time on the oculus on acid and it was very interesting during the peak of my experience i couldnt handle vr for more than very brief stints but on the way up and down it was amazing

i was a bit worried about losing myself in vr during the experience and before putting on the headset kept repeating remember this is only a simulation and i kept that in mind throughout the vr experiences but when i took off the headset i suddenly concluded that all of life was just a simulation and no different from the oculus

i found that passive experiences worked far better than trying to actually play a game robot recall was way way too stressful but fantasynth chez nous was awesome as were most things i could sit back and just observe played with soundself which was interesting and has so much potential even aircar was incredible surge was intense and probably not for everyone

i wrote up the experience hereurlandtheoculusrift entirely noncommercial blog btw will continue to update as i try more software out went through about twenty programs before i needed to reconnect with others irl looking forward to trying more and will keep writing up the best ones as i experience them"
13.585114,12.786712,Addicted,"first time tripping on shrooms
i have tripped on acid a good handful of times but shrooms is a totally different experience well at least for me so here it goes

t 00 ate the eighth of shrooms of south american cubenzi with some chips just because they tasted like shit 

t 15 already started noticing small effects in the background but disappeared when i looked at them

t 30 i was already coming up because i began to see small patterns move back in forth but they were all in sequence i decided to go on a walk to washington park which was just a ten minute walk when i stepped outside the door i was hit and i went very light headed but it faded away after a few seconds i was walking down the road listening to some flatbush zombies and the tress started swaying back in forth kinda cartoon like
  
t45 i arrived at washington park by the minute the trip was just hitting me harder and harder the trees were swaying back and forth as if they were shape shifting in place i was walking on one of the trails and it felt like i was part of nature
t100 i was peaking within an hour of the trip i was peaking pretty hard so i decided to lay down somewhere i picked a spot to lay down excluded from the main trails when i was laying down i felt locked into the ground but a good way the birds chirping enhanced but every sound i heard was enhanced but it echoed at the same time  the sunset was so beautiful to watch i lost track time laying down because i was so focused on my surrounds because i was so intrigued 
t 145 i’m assuming i was laying down for a good bit of time so i decided to continue walking on the trail to the top of the mountain because there is this gorgeous view point up there i arrived the top everything around me was so cartoon like but intensifying in my face back and forth the view of the whole town was just amazing i decided to call it a day and walk home i have learned a lot from this trip it was very self cleansing because i was depressed at the time overall this trip was very life changing on my new perspective how i think of life  "
12.985892,13.764407,Addicted,"benadryl tripping terrifying in the present insightful in the future
benadryl or diphenhydramine is a deliriant of the antihistamine drug class deliriants are considered to be actual hallucinogens due to extreme visuals that are often hard or impossible to distinguish from reality for those who try this drug they often only do so once aside from a wide array of often hyper realistic and terrifying hallucinations there are also a variety of uncomfortable physical and cognitive effects the drug has to offer


despite the negative connotation of the drug i personally enjoy the use of diphenhydramine as a psychedelic and to explore psychonautics though benadryl trips are sometimes extremely disorienting and terrifying in the present looking back on them leaves me with insightful thoughts and experiences


the following experience i am about to share is a 750 mg diphenhydramine trip one day after classes my senior year in high school


backstory frequently in my highschool days i would shop around for both dxm and dph as they were legal and i thoroughly enjoyed the trips this particular trip was 750mg 30 pills dph that i had been saving for sometime at this point i had been experimenting with benadryl over the span of about four months with my biggest break between trips being about three weeks


530 pm  t  000

the act of ingesting dph is always a chore for me as i primarily only purchase the pill form if you want to access the delusions and hallucinations it has to offer you need to take higher doses and higher doses mean more pills 


after ingesting thirty pills in sequences of five i couldnt help but feel a bit nervous though looking back on my trips greatly intrigues me and i never necessarily regret it i will not deny that the peak of large dose trips certainly is scary nevertheless it was what i wanted to do and i had taken some necessary hard reduction means grounding tools pseduotripsitters etc

t  045
throughout the onset i chose to relax at my computer watching videos and listening to music to me the effects of dph are a gradual progression with full fledged hallucinations never occurring instantaneously at times i will placebo myself into feeling some physical effects at the trips early stages but not this time


t  130

at around the first hour i got up from my desk to walk around a for a bit in preparation of the trip instantaneously i felt the eversofamiliar perception of body weight increase it was as if gravity was multiplied tenfold and weights were barring down on all of my limbs in addition to an increased sense of mass my voice began to fail me i would think i was using my regular voice but actually be speaking at almost a whisper level luckily it was daytime and a mild temperature so i went to stand outside for a few minutes before returning to my room


t  200

the transition period from the first hour to the second was when my trip began to escalate lying in my bed i would gaze into the perimeter of my room where the various cobwebs and dust conglomerates began to shake back and forth it was almost as if wind was circling my room as the dust contents on my ceiling would twirl and shake around themselves


every so often i would attempt to focus on one of the particulates only to seemingly watch it slide down the walls to meet another cobweb at times i would focus onto one and it would appear to sprout small legs and crawl around my room after refocusing my eyes and blinking it would return to its state of shaking back and forth in its starting position

moving into the second hour was when i saw the first of the many commonlyknown benadryl insects it manifested itself into the outline of a spider which quickly crawled across my room and out of site it looked nothing like any realistic interpretation of a spider but instead seemed to be the outline of one with its insides being clear its various limbs moved about in spastic motions while traversing my room at this point in my opinion it is hard for anybody to not appear scared in nature despite how much i enjoy the experiences i am always somewhat scared during the trips i believe this can be attributed to the inherit paranoia and psychosis which accompany high doses of the drug


t  200400
at this point in the trip my time management skills were not up to par with my sober self the following are recounts of the trip that i remembering happening but with no coherent idea of when


 the common theme of insects was very prevalent i rarely see flying insects just manifestations of arachnids that dip and dart throughout my peripherals being a man with long hair at times i piece of hair would brush my skin and it would send me into an extreme sense of panic as i genuinely believed these insects were crawling on me


 at various intervals throughout the trip my dog would walk into my room and up to me upon attempting to pet him would result in my hand falling directly through the obviously imaginary canine


 i stood up and peered into my brothers room a standup bass that was lying in his bed resembles to me a body with a human skull resting on the chest area


 in attempts to ground myself i would try to text friends this resulted in either complete gibberish or thinking i sent something out accompanying these texts my phone began to seemingly vibrate consistently making me believe i was receiving text messages


 multiple times i sensed my own doom as my heart rate would seemingly increase to a bpm that of 160  170


 textures specifically woodgrained would swirl and contort as i viewed them


 all lighting in my room appeared dark and sinister


 spontaneous tactile sensations would send me into mini convulsions and i would seemingly seize out multiple times though never actually having a seizure i rapidly convulsed so take that as you will


 complete libido and emotion suppression aside from delirium psychosis and paranoia


t  400

at what i believe was around nine or ten i attempted to go to sleep benadryl is a drug that has the capability of making you extraordinarily tired this particular time i felt very fatigued and exhausted but was completely unable to sleep when attempting to sleep auditory hallucinations would plague my attempt at rest i would hear knocking at my window and screams seemingly coming from my back yard surprisingly the act of closing my eyes did not leave my with horrendous internal hallucinations but instead was a sort of solace from the many unspeakable horrors manifesting themself into external hallucinations


after effects

i know at some point i eventually fell asleep i have no recollection of when when i woke up the next day i still felt rather confused and had brain fog the drug itself makes me very apathetic after a trip which most likely contributes to a feeling of depression and being drained


thank you for reading i have many other trips that i would be happy to report on if anyone is interested"
15.300719,13.042246,Addicted,"pounded into wet clay
i’m writing this a couple days after to fact in part to carve the experience more deeply into my mind and in part to convince myself that i have not permanently damaged my brain and lost the ability to communicate with language here goes nothing…

though i’d done a considerable amount of psychedelics in college as a 37 year old i had gotten a bit disconnected from these adventures also as a 37 year old i had begun to sink into a progressively stagnant depression i struggle with a vast emotional emptiness and an inability to experience joy in the world

anyways

i thought mushrooms might help me and so have been experimenting with them over the last several months since i began cultivating them last october 

i had a batch of chitwan that i thought was quite weak but wasnt sure if i had just overheated them while dehydrating in order to figure that out i dried a second batch at 120 degrees took forever expecting that this would be a super mellow trip and that i could write off chitwan as a weak strain

i had dramatically underestimated the mushrooms

i measured out 35 grams of dry powder into a small glass of orange juice expecting that at most i might experience a mild high that would make me more fun company for my wife when we take a walk through the neighborhood upon her return

i felt them coming on within about ten minutes and realized that i had not established an intention for the trip i pulled out a pad of paper and a pen and wrote myself a note the primary intention was this i have lost the passion i had when i was younger and i would like to reconnect with it

i felt there must be some ember of passion that is hidden within myself if i could just find it then i could protect it stoke it fan the flames into something that might power me through to achieve more than i have in my middling life

i put the note down and went to the living room where i was staring at our potted plants when my wife came home i briefly explained to her what was going on made some commentary about how i was experiencing the beauty of things in our home and then promptly went to bed

laying down on the bed i found that when i closed my eyes there was a spinning cartoon gearwork i found it a bit unpleasant and was about to get up but then thought to myself that i should just see where this goes i closed my eyes and settled into bed

at this point my wife put on some nina simone in the next room while she answered emails on her computer my god nina simone

i was loving the beauty of the music and the pace of it helped to slow the mechanical whirring and spinning the senseless geometry began to coalesce and i had the impression of a woman standing at a gate with more whirling clockwork behind it i had the sense that she was offering me an opportunity to see behind the gate to go deeper into the experience but only if i stayed in the darkness of that bed

around this time i began to notice back pain creeping up into the experience i’ve been dealing with various musculoskeletal pain issues for years now it’s mainly under control but is something im constantly protecting against a friend who is deep into spiritual journeys had encouraged me to really “go into” my pain when it presents during a trip so that’s what i did

it was a bright ribbon of pain in my low back and i had this sense from the woman gatekeeper that i could surrender this pain up to her if i chose so that’s what i did

the pain went away

things seemed to be going well so i figured it was a good time to ask my question to the lady at the gate how do i reconnect with the passion of my youth

my pain came back

i surrendered it to her again it evaporated away i asked my question again

the pain returned

at this point i had a choice i could either press through with my intention or i could surrender it and my pain would stop

i went deeper into this surrender as quickly as discomfort could present itself i would let go of it no pain could touch me 

i had this sense that if i continued to let go to give up that i could free myself of all the pain that i experienced in my life not just the physical pain but also the emotional pain of my own personal professional and financial failures but this meant that i would have to let go of all the beautiful things in my life as well all the good things

i thought of my wife downstairs i wanted to call out to her and to tell her i loved her but i knew that if i did then the pain would come back

the scale of the choice became clear to me i would have to abandon all future joy to get this pain to go awayit also meant that i would have to abandon my wife it felt like a betrayal i was ashamed of my weakness but i was so tired of the pain of living

i realized that i was dying i realized that my death was inevitable and i absolutely surrendered to it

i covered my face with my hands whispered “i give up” and began weeping the parts of me that felt pain began to slough off peeling back like the layers of an onion and when that pain went away i had this ecstatic feeling of joy and pleasure i began to laugh and the pain returned i surrendered to it again and it sloughed off into carbon and new joy took its place i found myself crying and laughing at the same time whispering over and over and over “i give up i give up i give up…”

i felt in that moment that the laughter and the weepingit was the exact same fucking thing which was both heartbreaking and hilarious all at the same time 

as i continued through with this peeling back and sloughing off i kept waiting to die i kept waiting for all sensation to end as more of me was surrendered to the universe i had the sense that the universe and i were composed of the same inert stuff it was all just clay that had always existed and always would exist the life i had lived was just a dance of that clay a playful illusion because being clay in a timeless void is boring everything that had happened or would happen was just the unfolded version of that static stuff

i called out to my wife who came and lied down beside me  she held me while i laughed and wept and tried to explain to her what i was experiencing she began to laugh and weep at this point i began to reenter the world though i was significantly confused

i used my watch to find that i was an hour and a half into the experience time didn’t mean much to me id touched eternity i took a shower and thought it funny that matter was “cleaning” itself with other matter i struggled to find underwear and found myself laughing that matter was looking for other matter

after getting dressedwhich took some timewe decided to go for that walk it was only about 930 we strolled through the neighborhood and decided to grab a beer at a local bar 

i explained the trip as best i could i noted that i had abandoned her in order to end my suffering and that this was an expression of my own human weakness i knew that one day i would die and we would be apart and there was nothing i could do about it i had accepted this but still felt i should apologize she smiled and said she understood

in recapping it to her i shared my original intention to reconnect with the passion of my youth

i was about to tell her that i ended up not realizing my intention just had some insight into my own human frailty and came to terms with it

then it hit me and i felt tears welling up again

i surrendered up to the universe everything that i could as many layers of the onion as i could offer up more somehow appeared out of this shining center it was like i dropped everything i could into the void but this one thing bounced back

i realized that what bounced back was the part of me that could feel pain and joy and create new things it was that ember i was searching for 

i had been suffocating it in attachments holding on to my old pain old grievances old shame i was rootbound in my soul i had to surrender up my attachments to find that passion again

and this meant that “my passion” was not some tool for me to control not a spark i take command of and direct to accomplish things in this world it’s something that i have to listen to to follow and if i want to have it then i have to be willing to experience all kinds of new pain in my life i have to choose that and the only way to do that is to let go of my old pain to surrender to the universe 

but in the end it’s not a plea deal “if i surrender than i will get the passion of my youth” no man i surrender because i give up because ive already lost no reward on the other side i am a piece of wet clay and one day i will be pounded back into the clay from which i came 

i cannot fight it 

i give up

and then the moment i do theres that spark

16.115246,17.46296,Addicted,"dmt  baby steps
i recently obtained dmt and i decided i would do a smaller amount before i went for a brakethrough so here is what happened with my first encounter 

i had trouble actually obtaining dmt and then once i got i was honestly really nervous not mentally but physically my heart was pounding so i took a bath and then got out and layed against the wall with some pillows 

1105 pm  let me state that i have dmt in ejuice form and was informed it takes around 34 good hits of for a powerful experience i took an insanely large hit and held it in until it made me cough 

t  10 seconds  within 10 seconds i felt an instant wave of euphoria go all over like a wave throughout my being 

t 15 seconds  i take a large second hit and and the best way i can describe what happened is i started having visuals very much like an extremely high dose of lsdcomparative to a 1400ug trip in the past 

t  45 seconds  at this point i decide to take one more hit it wasnt that large as the whole room was very overwhelming

after this third hit i saw diamond patterns over existence everything seemed to melt to the floor and shatter when they hit it soon i was focusing on what seemed to be a portal and i had this urge to close my eyes i saw a being rip open a hole and i didnt jump inside but i could see these insane colors none like i had ever seen before in these odd patterns swirling everywhere at this point i was not thinking i quickly though let me take one more hit to jump into that portal but by the time i had opened my eyes it had been 15 minutes and i realized it was too late 

after i opened my eyes i got an insanely weird feeling nothing seemed real everything was fake i looked in the mirror and i felt fake 

tonight i will be attempting to jump into the rabbit whole by hitting it until i cant anymore 

to anyone that has anxiety about dmt like me let me say you will be fine

15.820476,13.462169,Addicted,"mushrooms 46g  it is what it is
intro i already experienced ego death once before over a year ago and i have not taken shrooms since then ego death then was pretty much out of my control after that it seemed like a wonderful dream and i remember forgetting how to be human like its a constant activity it was a rather positive experience 

this time i took it with the idea of working on some personal problems mistake taking a large dose for that so i was trying to be conscious i took the dose over the period od 6090min and i think that made a big difference 

it started slowly and then it speed up really fast i remember a feeling that i could influence reality but deep inside i had this feeling that there is no point of actually changing anything it is what it is 

then i started losing it everything started bending and i was one one with everything and all of my personal problems seemed so trivial not worthy of pondering over

next was a feeling that i was about to disintegrate like physically my nose started bleeding and i could taste the blood in my mouth afterward it turned out i was not actually bleeding i had a feeling that my eye is moved my teeth felt weird like i was melting this is me surrendering to the energy it was not scary it just was 

the reality was like an illusion a meaningless mirage i was creating and i was trying to think of our history progress as a species as a planet i was trying to grasp on something objective that is viewed as great progress but even that was not enough everything seemed like an illusion 

at one moment a thought of jumping thru the window came to my mind but the action to do that was unnecessary it would not change anything there is nothing to jump to 

again i started forgetting how to be human again that feeling like that is something i do over and over and over again and it seemed pointless to returning to being a human i was everything i was my room my building my friends my family my loved ones to what to return when i am everything 

but still probably because i took the dose gradually i first had this feeling that this is it this is the step before you release yourself to that infinite energy when the experience is too abstract to be comprehended it felt like a step before disintegrating into the energy 

i had these moments when i remembered you took shrooms this is just a trip in 2 hours everything will return to normal and you will be the same person with his problems wishes desires goals just stay safe

and that was the only thing i felt i had no control over time i knew time will pass and once again i will be in this body

i realized that i needed someone besides myself i didnt want to let go now when i look back to it i am not sure why i didnt let to i kept repeating you have to go back you want to be human you have something to get back to 

i went to take a shower i took all my clothes off put hot water then cold water and it was so meaningless i was the water i was the shower it was all me 

i called a friend asked her to come over i told her what has happened and that i cant make a difference between her and me and this table and this room and that i just need an anchor to reality

and then i just talked to her at the start i would just stop talking because she was i and i was her we were one to whom was i talking then

i am not very close to her in some traditional meaning but it was such intimate experience i was realizing at that moment how crazy everything sounded while i talked to her because everything was getting lost in the translation first when i translated it into my words then when she translated my words into her thoughts
i still had a grasp that i took shrooms and i explained that i do realize that my behavior right now will seem crazy to her and it will seem weird to me in a couple of ours and that next time we will be laughing over this  

after awhile i felt slowly like chains this sounds too dramatical of existing was falling down on me all the physical and psychical barriers limiting that endless energy after 2 hours of talking and maybe 5h of tripping i was myself again i started feeling my body and feeling usually i took a shower and i was so relaxed i was totally sober and i tried going to sleep but i could not because in fact i was not tired i slept for 5 hours and now i am good as new 

before when i was taking shrooms it needed me 1 extra day to process the experience but today it is not like this 

thank you for reading

13.823105,11.765303,Addicted,"moonman trip report
after getting hold of some freebase dmt we were pretty eager to try it out we didnt really have the right equipment at the time and made the mistake of taking the whole lot in one hit i immediately went into shock and couldnt breath properly for a solid ten minutes it probably didnt help that i currently have a chest infection and i would not recommend this method at all

within seconds i began to trip hard

i found myself in above a launch pad in a towering rocket although there was space for others i was at first alone

i quickly took off and found myself drifting away from earth toward the moon as i floated away from earth by this time no wider than a thumb in my field of view

passing the moon i stepped into my spacesuit and left the craft from there i floated outward tethered by a thin cable but otherwise free to drift into the dark night  completely in awe of all i saw below me

the moon was a blueishsilver in colour and i could swear it shimmered though that may have just been a reflection from the inside of my helmet

upon returning to my ship the music sent me spinning i drifted wholly weightless through the airlock around me were an array of instruments and shiny white surfaces as i floated into the central area of the capsule my friends were revealed all having taken their place in the chairs beside mine

i could feel my many companions all of their ecstasy and happiness

by this time we had long since passed the moon the earth was no longer visible but ahead lay a small red dot before i knew it we were descending through the martian atmosphere the red planet growing infinitely large in my field of view

fifty feet from the ground i waved goodbye to my friends and left my body below me i could see the others only now they moved like ants as though i were watching a timelapse

i wanted to stay to walk on the surface and be with my friends  i handt realised the lofty heights of my final destination

having left my body it was now possible to travel not only in space but in time the desire to stay dissolved away  i accepted the inviting hand that beckoned from the empty darkness of space

before i could react i was flung to the outer reaches of the solar system jupiter saturn neptune and pluto passed by successively faster time accelerating all the while

i basked in all the glory of the cosmos every awesome star galaxy and nebula simultaneously seeing it all and yet nothing as all was lost on such a vast scale

my attention was drawn to a small planet in a solar system infinitely far from earth my bodiless mind drifted down and below me i saw an entire civilisation we had left our home and begun to populate the universe

yet i couldnt say we because without a body i was not human

epochs passed and humankind spread out farther still covering every corner of the universe thriving adapting and evolving all the while before long new species began to evolve and soon after that the beings which populated the universe hardly resembled humans at all

there were all variety of exotic species and billions of years had passed since i had last seen earth i travelled back to the planet i was called home so much time had passed that i hardly recognised  it

before me i saw everything the entire history of existence from the prebiotic soup of organic molecules to the very end of time and everything in between all simultaneously shown unconcerned by the existence of time

the time i had come from appeared as a minuscule dot almost indistinguishable from the beginning of time so early in story had i come from and how blind i had been because of that"
17.516685,14.767388,Addiction-prone,"my first lsd experience  discovering the liquid paradise of pure ecstasy
it all happened at a 3 day music festival it was our second day and i was pretty tired from the previous night’s mdma alcohol and doobie sessions i was pretty stoned right before i decided to take it my heart jumped a tiny bit when i got offered a tab i don’t remember the exact dosage of it for i was pretty ignorant and still probably am but i thought – “fuck it once in a lifetime hey”  i did not really know anything about acid or even what the effects would be to be honest i did not even know acid was slang for lsd or that these small sheets were dipped in the liquid chemical that is lsd i thought the tabs were a solid form of the dug i had succumbed to group pressure i did not mind though all of us were pretty close and i don’t even think the “main mac” of our group has ever taken lsd in any large dose because he later said he never experienced any sort of visuals or hallucinations before neither did he that night as we all stood in a circle me and one of my friends each took a full tab the other two main mac and his disciple split theirs in two and had only half a tab 

it was 6pm and directly after each of us dropped we proceeded from our camping ground to the stage where a band i liked was playing i noticed some slight changes in my senses i felt slightly drunk as the band kept playing the “crew” i dropped with disappeared and i was all by myself 

luckily i saw one of my good college buddies and his girlfriend and rejoiced with delight upon seeing them

“whatsup” we exclaimed in laughter and surprise fist bumped and hugged

“shit so glad i found you guys” i laughed

about 20 minutes passed when the band finished  together the three of us walked towards the “redbull trance stage” it sat at the bottom of a very steep hill that was scattered with small to large rocks with a few acacia trees here and there and absolutely packed with people encapsulated in ecstatic dance the stage was big square blue and red and colours from the whole spectrum shot out from lasers and lights illuminating the otherwise completely dark surroundings large black speakers bellowed the deep melodic house tunes the dj stood like a god orchestrating the whole crowd’s movements and vibes

at first we sat at the very top of the hill again i was reunited with past friends long since seen again i was delighted of finding some grip in reality they decided to smoke a joint i unbeknownst chimed in on the toking at this point the strangeness of the high started setting in my limbs and hands felt watery it felt like i was sweating but i wasn’t hot at all i noticed the link between thinking and speaking started to blur my voice sounded clear and melodic as i was sitting i looked at a friend and he smiled at me his smile seemed to go from one ear to the other and his whole face looked extremely thin and sharp quite demonic i thought i was still in control at this moment so i knew it was only the drug although i was a bit terrified 

“i just took some acid” 

whoa what’s up with my voice why the fuck is he smiling at me like that

“really nice man have you done it before”

“yeah like three times” i lied 

“haha awesome dude” his overwhelming glance and smile glaring back at me

just the drugs…just the drugs

another friend came into the conversation and stood above me he lost a lot of weight recently as he stood over me his whole body seemed to extend far into the air his face even more twisted sharpened and strangely silky

just…the…drugs…

i decided to go with it

“you look different man”

“thanks dude”

“no no…not a compliment…i mean you look really strange” 

laughter 

i felt good 

i like dancing at the thought of this i immediately jumped up and convinced everyone to join me at the very front of the stage my friend’s girl gave me a cigarette

my anchor 

i was convinced they all knew that i was on some heavy shit…i was convinced they were as well as i was making my way down the very unstable hill i noticed my legs felt spaghettilike stretching what seemed like meters in front of me  i took a drag 

the cigarette seemed extremely silky in texture long and beautiful the smoke looked alive and beating

we pushed ourselves to the front

before this moment i have not really paid attention to the music suddenly i heard sounds i have never before heard strange heavenly beats emulated from an unknown source

usually it took effort in order to even listen to a song but now  not only was i listening very clearly and very naturally – i was feeling seeing the music it had an undefinable amount of dimensions it felt unreal yet so natural – as if it was meant to be listened to in this way as if it was written for me  for this moment 

the dj had complete control of me with every bass drop he pulled me apart and rearranged me i was taller than everyone i started to become part of the sound waves i would retract become normal again it was amazing i was dancing i made jokes “i’m a fucking rainbow” i would tell people around me and they would laugh and someone would ask “what the hell did you take” and i would say “mmmustard sauce” and giggle and they would giggle 

eventually the dj’s session was over i started walking towards the next stage alone upon my arrival i noticed an abnormal silence throughout the whole venue broken only by what seemed to be gentle chimes and distant whistles coming from the next stage i felt like i was in some other fantastical ancient place filled with magic everything everywhere was covered in luminous silk beautiful and engaging  everything flowed and breathed

now i could only see a few people in the landscape of the festival it felt like everyone i saw was on the same high as me tripping we found each other in this wondrous realm of an alternate reality 

an afro wearing white dude was laying down some intense riffs on his guitar he would say things about our world we are now in  how this is what we have come here to do to have fun to have pleasure as i stood by myself to the side of the stage the music was flowing through me whereas the trance had pulled me apart it seemed as if i was elevated by the melodic indie sounds my body would flow with each strum far up into the skies  i became air water fire earth

i was dancing beautifully enchantingly others joined around me 

i opened my eyes i and everything around me was the most clear most beautiful liquid gold at once i felt as if i was in the most mature world possible everything was brighter than i ever could have imagined 

holy shit holy shit this is the real world i know i am why has this been kept a secret from me for so long

i became sad for a moment pondering the thought of being left out 

how could my parents have kept me out of this my friends did they know was this their way of telling me at a music festival was my whole life leading up to this moment am i graduating life

all my worries fears beliefs and everything i thought i knew about the world flew straight out of my mind

a tremendous amount of pleasure and confidence overcame me as i continued dancing in the pure ecstatic revelations of my mind i was merging sexually with everything and everyone around me i was having overwhelmingly extremely orgasmic other worldly sex in some strange golden colourful extremely vivid liquid state with the whole spectrum of the universe every organism everything was alive and making love 

i was being worshipped thanked and praised in orgasmic drawn out moans of absolute pleasure by the most beautiful creatures i have ever seen and i was the most beautiful thing that has ever existedi and everyone were in our purest states of being 

im in heaven im god i always knew this how could i have forgotten i created all of this for me just for me ohgod im everyone everything me an average manchild of 21 years of age me from a boring town a boring life it was me only me thank you thank you

there are no words to describe the ultimate pleasure and love for myself others and everything i felt at that moment 

at the end of the climax i receded in solitude towards the back of the stage i lied down slowly on the soft smooth grass in tremendous relief and satisfaction a few of the girls from our heavenly orgy came and stood over me they smiled down and asked if i was all right

“yes…” i said smiling contently

i just wish someone would skip this shitty music i joked

they laughed and smiled back

i closed my eyes

what happened next cannot be described in words but some images remain

as if going through an endless row of doorways i was shown kindly by everyone i had ever known the true reality of the world my guides were older younger different looking versions of me at different times of my eternal life  they knew everything i was everything i am and everything i was to become  they accepted me unconditionally with the most tremendous amount of love 

i was shown where all began and all ended it was shown clearer now that i everyone and everything in the whole universe was god  in the most selfish pleasurable guilt free way imaginable  times infinity further than what our earthly bound minds could possibly comprehend

i always knew i always knew i just had to remember oh how could i have forgotten

i was embraced lifted in celebratory applause and wonderful grace as the crescendo of the most beautiful music ever constructed chimed in crystal clarity throughout all of the universe 

i was elevated far into the sky the stars and the galaxy  far above myself our world and all existence

at the edge of the universe was a large circular mechanism of infinite proportion interlocking it shifted heavily cranking open to expose the darkest of dark places at its centre 

i was now looking down on existence lovingly accepting all as it is as it was and as it always will be

i entered the void – a place of peace and calamity impossible to describe

time space and everything in between disappeared for all eternity i was nothing no one 

i awoke 

i was born"
19.455557,14.216868,Addicted,"first time with any psychedelic lsd trip report long
this is a trip report from the first time i took any type of psychedelic other than weed and any other drug other than alcohol weed and dph sorry for it being so long its mainly for me to look back on and something to link to my friends that are always asking what all lsd and psychedelics are like but for anyone else who may want to read here it is

note that what i had was not real lsd like i was told it was from who i bought it from it was some type of rc that i unfortunately cant identify

pretrip
i had been wanting to get my hands on some lsd or shrooms for a year now but couldnt find anyone who could get me any finally i meet someone who tells me he can get me a tab of lsd next week next week comes and we meet up he tells me that its double dabbed lsd with a drop on each side instead of just one at first im having my doubts about buying it just because theres no way of telling if its actually real or just a little piece of paper after a while of contemplating i decide to go ahead and buy it from him for 20

pretrip extended
i then went back home and planned to trip later that night since it was friday and i had nothing to do for the next 24 hours i call my friend over and ask him to be my sitter he agrees and arrives at around 430pm with 05 grams of dank headband he brought with him we chill out and smoke the 5 out of my pipe i only take 1 or 2 small hits and let him have the rest because i want to be sober before i drop the acid which i planned to drop at 600pm in about an hour and 30 minutes also i was the only one who was going to be tripping and i didnt want him to feel bad because he was sober and i was going to be tripping 

lucy drop
so 600pm rolls around and my high is pretty much gone im only a 3 while my friend is still at a 6 i take the acid and keep it under my tongue to see if i can identify it as real lsd or some kind of research chemical like i suspected its not real i can tell because it has a bitter metallic taste to it and it also begins to numb my tongue and gums after a while im not very disappointed because i know its still going to make me trip it was some kind of other research chemical likely nbome or dox i keep the small blank white tab under my tongue for another 15 minutes before i swallow it knowing thats probably the only way for it to work since its not real lsd

1st hour
i sit and wait in my room for the effects to kick in i turn on my black light and some orange rope lights i have to make the trip even more fun i also light a candle and burn some incense and play a playlist i had made just for the day i trip on acid an hour goes by with no noticeable effects me and my friend are just sitting down chilling listening to music then all of a sudden out of the blue i just bust out laughing for no reason one second everything is normal and the next im laughing hysterically for no reason what so ever and i cant stop myself my friend starts laughing too and asks whats so funny unable to talk i continue laughing harder than i ever have unable to stop for literally the next 5 minutes it started becoming a struggle to breathe after a while thats how hard i was laughing finally when i calm down my friend asks again lol what was so funny i replied with i dont know i couldnt control myself there for a second after this i feel like im definitely starting to come up im starting to feel very euphoric and happy as i begin to smile and giggle at everything my senses are also becoming more and more enhanced especially my sense of hearing pink floyd sounds fucking amazing

1st hour  30 minutes
about an hour and 30 minutes into the trip i begin seeing faint oevs everything is starting to become wavy and looks like its breathing brighter objects like the computer monitor lights the tv anything giving off light basically is even more wavy and noticeable i go to the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror to see if my pupils were dilated i at first thought that these effects were just placebo so i wanted to make sure i was actually tripping sure enough my pupils are saucers that was really cool to me seeing how big my pupils were when i walk back into my room which is all set up to have a trippy atmosphere it blows my mind seeing all the lights i had turned on and the music that was playing was amazing to me 

2nd hour
around the 2nd hour is when things start getting confusing by now the effects are pretty obvious and hard to ignore where as before i would question if i was actually tripping or if it was just placebo the most obvious oev is the wavy effect everything has urllikethis but not as intense normal still objects would appear to be calmly moving or breathing my desktop wallpaper looked animated even though it was just a still picture im also becoming more and more euphoric as time progresses but along with the building euphoria is the building confusion i would get up to do something but halfway through i would stop and forget what i was doing and id go off to do something else then id remember again only to forget as i attempt to complete the task again i would also frequently pause the music get up from my seat and just go wait a minute and stand there for a second before sitting back down and resume the music again i did this probably 10 or 20 times through out the trip creative and intense thoughts began racing through my head and it would become too overwhelming at points so i would stop the music to try and take a break from the intensity of the trip i would also stop everything to try and complete my thoughts like i said i had hundreds of intense creative ideas running through my head at a time so it was very overwhelming i would think of a brilliant idea stop the music and run for a piece of paper to write the idea down as quick as possible before another brilliant idea popped in my head id also think of how awesome it would be to do one thing but then think of how awesome it would be to do another for example i would think wow how amazing would it be to go outside and id go outside only to stand there for a second before thinking wow how amazing would it be to play some call of duty id then put in the disk to play the game but before even getting into a game id think of something else that would be more amazing to do i kept falling into these loops of confusion not knowing what to do because there is just so much to do in such little time i guess was my perspective i wanted to experience so much for the short time i was going to be tripping on acid that i couldnt get through the experiences fast enough

3rd hour  1st peak
these loops continued until the 3rd hour when i just decided to stop thinking so much and enjoy the trip id say the peak began around this time 3rd hour and lasted until the 4th hour by now oevs are very strong i realize that im probably peaking now not only becauase of how intense the oevs were but also because of how euphoric i was everything was so intense that i couldnt use the computer when typing i would look down at my hands and see purple and green urltracers while moving my fingers to type the letters on the keyboard were also glowing bright purple i would get so lost in the colors and tracers i was seeing while typing that i forgot what i was typing in the first place this is what made using the computer difficult because whenever i would look at the computer screen i would become hypnotized by the visuals i was seeing then all of a sudden a massive wave of energy rushed over me i suddenly became extremely energetic and excited and i jump out of my chair to play with my dog which was so fun i was running around playing with him all through out my house for the next hour laughing because of how euphoric i was my friend later told me afterwards that i was acting like i was on coke because of how excited and energetic i was during this time

4th hour
the 4th hour approaches and my friend expresses his boredom he lost his high a couple hours ago and tells me he doesnt want to be sober i guess after seeing how much fun i was having he wanted to have fun too i have 60 so i decide to call my dealer to buy some trees he lets me know hes available so we decide to go to his house and buy some he lives just 2 neighborhoods away up the street so we decide to just walk there i also wanted to walk so i could enjoy the nice cool breezy night the walk to my dealers house was interesting i feel like i started coming down from the trip once i started walking like i said brighter objects and colors would be more noticeable so walking outside in the darkness made it difficult to see the oevs i was seeing in my brightly lit room while walking i look in someones yard and see some strange object standing up in the middle of the yard its hard to see at first but after staring at it for a a while i determine its a fan it looked like one of those tall white fans that was turning left and right on its own i kept staring at it for a while because it didnt make sense how could a fan be on and running in the middle of someones yard where theres no socket or wall for it to be plugged into so i stop walking to try and focus on it and realize that it was a lawn mower 

5th hour
we get to my dealers house my friend waits outside while i go in he leads me to the garage where everything is smoky and hazy everything is so foggy that i could barely see my hand when i held it up in front of me he keeps walking through the garage and i almost loose him in the smoke but he comes back and hands me a fat bag and says thats 5 grams of some good ass og kush my dealer usually sells a gram for 20 so i was confused at first and told him that i only had 60 enough for 3 grams he then tells me i can have all 5 for 60 since he fucks with me 

6th hour
we get back to the house at around midnight 6 hours after dropping the rc the effects are fading away and the trip is no where near as intense as it was the first 4 hours ive always heard people warn not to smoke weed on lsd unless youre experienced because it will make things wayyy more intense but my friend wanted to get high and i couldnt turn down a toke besides i was coming down pretty fast so it wasnt like i was smoking at the peak still i decide to play it slow i only load up 03 grams into the bowl at first and me and my friend blow it down pretty fast so i go ahead and load another 05 grams into the bowl we take turns passing the bowl and he gives it back to me to kill off the last little bit there was i spark the lighter and move it towards the weed but stop before i light it i stop to stare at the flame of the lighter woahhh blue fire all the way the flame of the lighter was a light azure blue color that began turning into a dark royal blue color as i continued to stare at it it was mesmerizing as it began to turn url1dpu1cjt4rmtfyb43ssuaiaaaaaaaaadapw8yxrnijmgs1600colourreplacementlighterjpgpurple then yellow and then back to blue again i put the flame up to the weed as im holding the bowl up to my mouth with one hand and sparking the weed with the lighter in the other 

7th hour  2nd peak
i inhale hold it for 5 seconds then exhale the moment i begin exhaling everything starts slowly vibrating then the vibrations turn into the wavy breathing effect everything had ealier but its now way more intense the weed instantly propels the trip back into an intense peak even more intense than the first peak colors begin urlchanging and distorting and everything becomes brighter and more vivid with music blaring me and my friend are just sitting there laughing at random shit enjoying ourselves me more so than him lol then my walls which are white started changing colors they changed to yellow then orange and then red green and purple tracers were also coming off anything moving it become so intense there was a moment where i felt like i briefly blacked out and was unconsciouss like i briefly fell into a deep dream state i was sitting there and i started drifting off into a whole different reality i dont remember it very clearly but i just remember snapping back into reality and saying damn i lost all sense of reality there for a second which i did just then the lsd playlist i had made ended so me and my friend decide to watch the sopranos not even 10 minutes in the show my friend is asleep thats what og kush will do i wake him up and tell him he can go sleep on my bed and that ill take the couch because i wanted to stay up and enjoy my trip watching the sopranos for the rest of the night was a trip the characters faces were constantly morphing and it was hard to identify them their facial features would morph exactly like urlthis but faster and smoother and it didnt look as obvious and theyd go from looking normal to looking like a completely different person tonys eyes tony is the main character and mouth were also abnormally urlcdncomphotosimagesnewsfeed000307761f6cjpgsmall but no one elses just his it was weird i eventually fell asleep still very much tripping in the middle of the second episode of which ever season it was it was around 300am when i fell asleep so i was around 9 hours in

it was a very fun first trip with no negatives at all except i felt sore all next day which was probably because of how much i was running and jumping around other than that it was one of the best experiences of my life

13.330286,14.533851,Addicted,"trip report psilocin 40mg
this is an unconventional report

for those wondering the compound was synthesized by a trusted third party

experience time line the main effects lasted a total of 9 hours while they peaked around hour 34  the come up before visuals started was just less than an hour mental state was clear until 15 hours into the experience when the visuals developed further only to spring to life the unnatural world inside my home it might be described as riding a single very large wave and turning out the backside moments before it crashes on the shoreline if you are familiar with surfing if you are familiar with psychedelic mushrooms then you know that the mushroom experience comes in waves building and receding in strength only to swell to a new heights during the next wave

details music kickstarted the experience but was quickly removed because of extreme peace followed by rushes of paranoia the music is called are you shpongled by shpongle it is a perfect complement to the mushroom state comeup was extremely quick an ever intensifying wave of emotion and psychedelia persisted until my mental state was broken down to that of a child innocent and incapable of truly anything yet the fundamental instincts of survival remained embedded in the imagery that would present itself later in the evening the visuals could be described as fun and mushroomlike until the peak of the experience when they began to take a new form the visuals now held meaning and represented some memory long forgotten of a world forged in respect for earth and her plants an outofbody experience occurred during the peak of effects it had lasted perhaps but no way to really tell 5 minutes during which time my body started to shut down it did not believe it had reason to remain functioning as it did not detect a spirit within in effect i witnessed myself dying right before my eyes an experience i dont particularly want to repeat but will not be forgotten during the time i spent outside of my body i tried to speak to entities that revealed themselves to me the entities i spoke with did not speak english or any language that i recognized as modern i remember saying i dont know what you are but can we be friends it was so amazingly strange for myself i usually can keep grounded even in the most intense of situations

summary it was absolutely amazing but on the next adventure i will stick to the shulgin recommended doses nearly doubling the highest recommended dose made for an extremely intense experience although more intense than those experiences included in tihkal it fits the description of effects down to the word insights into side effects related to higher does during the beginning part of the experience no bruxism was noted where it usually occurs but my body was clearly shaking almost seizing level   from the new found energy that is common for me during high doses of any psychedelic substance heart rate was elevated more than i would have liked but that is effectively normal in any dose

after thoughts a recurring visual hallucination and something i remembering seeing when out of body also rabbits are very sensitive to psychedelics when compared to rats and humans i was noting that i am much more sensitive to mind altering effects than most people it was the rabbit i think very related to my mind set previous to the experience i rarely remember to close my eyes while i trip which means that all my previous reports described oevs  possibly otherwise but not likely it is a very stimulating experience until the peak is over when the body begins to relax as soon as the mind allows"

i have not had a drink of alcohol from that day what i have done is participated in a set system of directions that has helped me to form a new way of thinkingi changed my mind about some things when i was able to change my mind i became able to change my behaviorsimagine that
there are to many people to thank many more have now passed away many are just lost to time and distance no matter where they are i will tell you that i did not recover from a trashed out liver and a hopeless state of mind without them 
i humbly asked god to remove my obsession for alcohol i tell you that god answered that prayer i am a walking miracle i also tell you that he used recovering drunks and drug addicts as the tools to save me he even used some that had to die to get clean

today i have 3 years sober 3 years ago i was drinking alone watching a movie unguarded  chris herren story which changed my life in that movie a man was living selfishly through drugs alcohol women etc at one point he was passed out with homeless men i said to the tv “that’s pathetic” then i paused and said “oh wait that’s you justin” a feeling of disgrace came through my body at 2am i cried from shame but then a feeling of relief and joy because i told myself “you don’t have to live like that anymore” i haven’t had a drink since
from that day i decided to become the man i admire it’s been hard work very hard but the old me had to die for the new one to live some of you know my journey and i’ll tell you from day 1 in sobriety it has been therapy to fix the issues that caused the drinking being around other sober and positive folk people places things volunteering my humility led me to give back mentoring giving one on one yields the best gratitude from the 1st day i created my own rules and i do not negotiate the integrity of that ethos i don’t go to bars because i don’t belong thereits simply not interesting to me
3 years later what do i have an amazing wife before i was incapable of love or being loved 2 amazing twin daughters i can give them the love i never received growing up my financial status is great before i was borrowing money to support my habits i’m now closing on a new beautiful house next month for my family when i was drinking i sometimes lived in a garage also in 3 years i’ve learned a language become a published author been syndicated as a writer dedicated myself to boxing over 300 volunteermentoring efforts and most importantly held my head high and proud of the man i see in the mirror my drinking helped with selfworth social anxiety and many things that related to me not accepting me  thats because i didnt like who i was
if you felt humility through this thread that’s’ because it’s there and i feel it every day i changed my behavior that changed my life the life i have now is way better than the life i had before therefore my old ways are simply not interesting to me at all…and i think that is the secret to changerecovery…create a better life than the one you had my life is simple i do only a few things but i do those things exceptionally some might believe addiction is a disease but i believe the mind is powerful enough to rewire and learn new behaviors if one is willing to put in the work  this is because i believe in the essence of the human spirit and our capacity to be amazing people you are amazing did you know that if not read this thread again the chill you feel in your body is your potentialfollow that its honest it will guide you correctly

we hear so many slogans and cute little catch phrases and over time i learn what they truly mean

the disease talks to us and to others in our own voice it tells us all the sound logical reasons why we cant it tells us how were going to figure this out and be ok it tells us that goddamn lie that we can still go on doing what weve been doing

how waffles help me understand god
when i first started recovery i realized that i could not understand god and i did not need to here is how i understand today

assume for a minute that something created me cares for me loves me and has a plan for me these are the characteristics of a higher power implicit in the 12 steps right power greater than myself care of god gods will for us that sort of thing right

while i was using i thought i was the center of the universe so the next bit of this thought experiment came pretty easy what would it be like to be a higher power i know i can make waffles i love waffles i have a plan for waffles heck they can help me carry out my plan right ok so i am my waffles higher power

do waffles understand me nope do they need to nope they just have to be waffles 

and from my perspective it is a good deal i get yummy waffles that fuel me all morning giving me the power to do good or whatever 

from the waffles point of view though it kind of sucks to the waffle this higher power is going to chew him up and use him and in the end he is just poop 

so do i as gods waffle focus on the fact that i am dying a little bit every day that life is hard and painful and just not fair or do i rejoice in the fact that i get to be covered in sweetness for a short time until i can help fuel the love of the cosmos in some small way

today i will try to be of service to my fellow waffles

5 and a half years sober and im miserable
i was one of those guys who was head over heels in love with the program i went from a heroin junkie who had been in and out of jail and prison for 10 years to a homeowner and addiction counselor and my life just seemed amazing i became a person i really liked and got married and had a little girl  a couple years ago my marriage fell apart due to my motherinlaw committing suicide my ex just lost it sadly after 8 months of trying to fix the marriage i was through with being lied to and cheated on we got divorced and my ex relapsed  she ended up abusing and neglecting my daughter several times pretty severely luckily i documented everything and was able to get full custody of our daughter  my ex lives in another state now and has a new baby with her new boyfriend and they both actively drink and use thankfully my little girl is doing extremely well after several months of therapy  almost like nothing happened  she is very smart and i get amazing reports from her teachers  i am back in school fulltime trying to get my masters so i can provide the life i want for us
after i became a single parent my life changed drastically friendships fizzled out and eventually died my social life is nonexistent obviously and my meeting attendance and program involvement has stopped totally i still keep in touch with people i care about from meetings but its fairly superficial  every night she goes to bed around 730 and i clean the house and make her lunch for the next day and eat my dinner and then the loneliness sets in theres a woman ive been seeing for about a month who i care about immensely and our relationship is great but the times when im alone are so hard  i find myself choking up and wanting to cry for no reason or breaking down in tears at vaguely sad facebook videos  i feel very alone i used to feel like i had dozens of people i could talk to but now i feel like theres no one  my group of close friends has been steadily drifting apart since one of our group relapsed and killed himself last year and we dont talk much anymore i dont feel like i can speak to my family about my feelings because i dont want them to worry about me relapsing i have a lot on my shoulders and i just feel so isolated i have told the woman im dating about a lot of this but i dont want to constantly just emotionally dump on her because i have no one else  its a shitty feeling after the extremely messy divorce there was an adjustment period where i had to figure out how to do life as a single parent of a young child its possible that i just became very actionoriented at that point to avoid processing the pain of what had happened and maybe now that things are smoother the feelings are coming out i dont know i just know that im tired of feeling so sad all the time

a year ago today i got home from a drug fueled festival and realized that throwing a month of sobriety away had totally not been worth it then a few days later when i had a crisis around almost using but overcame the urges i realized that counting time was something that actually mattered to me this date marks a year of doing the next right thing and all of the magic thats come from that its still hard to believe that im happier without drugs but looking back the evidence speaks for itself

last week i spent some time with my family and got an update on my uncle hes someone from whom alcohol has taken a lot lost his career in law multiple duis lots of time spent in jail and finally a wife who had stuck with him for years before he burnt the bridge forever didnt have any relationship with his two kids for years anyway hes finally gotten his shit together and started to turn things around speaking to his kids again taking care of his body and stringing together time i asked my parents how long it had been and i was blown away to hear them reveal that it had been over 5 years since hes drank what the fuck it feels like this dudes time feels like its been a blip on the radar to me because he hasnt been actively involved in my life and yet it turns out hes got as much time as my biggest role model in recovery i think that revelation was my own journeys way of reminding me to stay humble

i was one of those guys who was head over heels in love with the program i went from a heroin junkie who had been in and out of jail and prison for 10 years to a homeowner and addiction counselor and my life just seemed amazing i became a person i really liked and got married and had a little girl  a couple years ago my marriage fell apart due to my motherinlaw committing suicide my ex just lost it sadly after 8 months of trying to fix the marriage i was through with being lied to and cheated on we got divorced and my ex relapsed  she ended up abusing and neglecting my daughter several times pretty severely luckily i documented everything and was able to get full custody of our daughter  my ex lives in another state now and has a new baby with her new boyfriend and they both actively drink and use thankfully my little girl is doing extremely well after several months of therapy  almost like nothing happened  she is very smart and i get amazing reports from her teachers  i am back in school fulltime trying to get my masters so i can provide the life i want for us
after i became a single parent my life changed drastically friendships fizzled out and eventually died my social life is nonexistent obviously and my meeting attendance and program involvement has stopped totally i still keep in touch with people i care about from meetings but its fairly superficial  every night she goes to bed around 730 and i clean the house and make her lunch for the next day and eat my dinner and then the loneliness sets in theres a woman ive been seeing for about a month who i care about immensely and our relationship is great but the times when im alone are so hard  i find myself choking up and wanting to cry for no reason or breaking down in tears at vaguely sad facebook videos  i feel very alone i used to feel like i had dozens of people i could talk to but now i feel like theres no one  my group of close friends has been steadily drifting apart since one of our group relapsed and killed himself last year and we dont talk much anymore i dont feel like i can speak to my family about my feelings because i dont want them to worry about me relapsing i have a lot on my shoulders and i just feel so isolated i have told the woman im dating about a lot of this but i dont want to constantly just emotionally dump on her because i have no one else  its a shitty feeling after the extremely messy divorce there was an adjustment period where i had to figure out how to do life as a single parent of a young child its possible that i just became very actionoriented at that point to avoid processing the pain of what had happened and maybe now that things are smoother the feelings are coming out i dont know i just know that im tired of feeling so sad all the time "

i was browsing my facebook on this dayurl and stumbled across a status i made 10 years prior celebrating beating the addiction  i know some think video games cant be an addiction but at the time i was playing 1214 hours per day 7 days per week  wow cost me my fiance my job many of my friends and even relationships with some of my family members  i racked up student debt because i was completely living off of it since i would skip work or leave early to participate in raids  i put on 60 pounds and topped out at  even on the rare occasions that i would go out with friends i would often be texting with other people i knew who i played wow with even though i didnt know any of them in real life

i can distinctly remember my 23rd birthday my fiance got a bunch of friends together to go out to bw3s for my birthday  my guild had been bashing our heads on vaelstrasz second boss in blackwing lair for almost two weeks and were finally about to beat him  all i could think about that night was how much i wanted to be there raiding with my guildmates and the loot i wanted to drop  by the time i quit i had right around 450 days played between all of my alts  to put that in mathematical perspective wow had been out barely over three years by the time i quit  thats just over 1100 days  in other words i spent around 41 of my life for three years playing that game

older wiser me knows that you never truly beat addiction to something completely you just win each battle one day at a time  so here i am now 10 years and two days clean  since then ive finished my bachelors degree become gainfully employed im happily married and have lost all of the weight that i put on and been a part time crossfit coach for the last three years in addition to my full time job  i still play video games just far more casually now and no more mmos  the itch to play wow is still there its always calling to me but ive made promises to my wife and to myself that id never pick it up again and i intend to stay true to that promise"

but this is about the meth mostly i am losing my train of thought i only had one hit tonight when i met up with some people to do the whole gaypnp stuff it is a ritual i dont smoke otherwise and it seems i have more than one addiction and now it looks like porn is really becoming an issue heavy porn use has probably contributed to this but as well as not feeling like i am enjoying my sexuality as much as everyone else i feel very sexually stunted it just seems to stem all from such a young age theres so much here that i dont feel comfortable posting but i have had an extremely strange and regretful sexual adolescence to say the least i just feel so alone im looking for ways to put the blame on others but i am the only one to blame for the situation im in i just feel so much regret suicide really is just a daily thought i feel bombarded with negativity all around me on a daily basis and just the unforgiving nature of reality i really wish i didnt relapse tonight i wish i could have gone a full year i wish i had felt enough satisfaction from quitting for 8 months that i would not have done it tonight but apparently i that wasnt enough for me

-11.161428,12.601111,NA,"the craving is a memory and the memory is a trick
heard this from a drug counselor who ran group sessions for cocaine addicts for many years and has seen every story or heard every excuse a hundred times over 

he told me that no craving ever caused a relapse cravings are normal human behavior and there is no way to stop them its the permissiongiving thoughts that cause relapses when we give in to the craving but you dont have to let cravings overpower you when you understand what they are 

cravings for food or shelter or sex are natural and hardwired into our human brains those needs are necessary for survival and will always be there the craving for cocaine is artificial we have inserted it there and it may never go away completely but it will lose strength over time 

do not fear a craving for they are bound to happen consider a craving to be a memory a recollection of how good it was to fill a need and remember that for all needs all cravings the brain remembers that fulfillment by highlighting the pleasure and downplaying the pain this is an important survival instinct for humans to remember for example how good the prey tasted while forgetting how dangerous it was to hunt for it

the craving is a memory but your brain remembers it with bias telling you it was mostly good and not much bad for the human needs and natural cravings this is good for the artificial cravings for drugs this is a trick because the pleasure of being high is not worth the damage to our bodies and the pain of losing our relationships remember that

do not fear the craving it will come sure enough but its just a memory of how it used to be and the memory is distorted to favor the pleasure and forget the pain 

the craving for drugs may turn up in a week or 2 months or 5 years or 30 years but its just the memory of an artificial need and your brain is tricking you to forget the pain now that you can see how the trick works you can stop falling for it"

ive been meaning to post this for a while because its absolutely insane to me but basically after about 5 times of doing dmt in a few month period boyfriend and i decide to take acid and smoke dmt note we had been trying to conceive for about a year before because i had believed i could not get pregnant and therefore it wouldnt hurt to try on that night 3817 we had taken the acid around 1 or 2am then we watched futurama and smoked weed until we both decided we wanted to smoke dmt since we had already peaked we both sat there for about 30 minutes just staring at it neither of us wanting to go first waiting for the other to go first to kick it off then finally i said fuck it ill go first because i always do and to just jump as he heated up the rig i was a little bit more afraidanxious than usual because i knew the acid would enhance the trip but i calmed myself and knew it would just feel even more amazing than usual took my hit held it in for about 510 seconds then blew it out as soon as i smelled the smoke  i had just exhaled i knew i was about to fucking be gone trip begins normally taking me back to the different places i always go on dmt the most bizarre but familiar feelings i have had i see my soul and then all of a sudden im in a black void with out a body no solids as far as i can see then i see a sort of cluster of light emitting ribbons there were about 10000 or so they were not taking up too much space in the black void they all seemed to weave around each other doing this beautiful dance without touching the others yet they were also a part of one body then i realized i was one of them and i had an absolutely overwhelming sense of euphoria and peace and love and togetherness and unity i remember thinking repeatedly who am i if i have no feelings or wants who am i if i have no feelings or wants it was confusing but it felt so right i didnt try to over analyze it then i just was there was no me no i no thoughts i simply was it was the most peaceful event i have experienced in my 20 years of life then i remember needing to lay down to just enjoy it and as i laid down i was taken through space and then i remember seeing my boyfriend looking at me kind of concerned and worried and i remember having the feeling of wanting to be intimate cuddle sex squeeze whatever he says i waved my hand at his crotch and he instantly got an erection like magic or some crazy shit andthen i reached out to him grabbing on to his t shirt and pulled him on top of me and just held him and caressed him with much intensity i felt amazing i guess i began sort of grinding my hips in to him and he asked if i wanted to have sex he seemed hesitant and worried but was like okay and then we had sex and it was the most crazy beautiful pleasurable experience i have ever ever ever experienced i remember just looking around actually turning my head and not knowing what to say besides wow its so beautiful and it was just the best feeling in the world and i remember moaning ridiculously loud but also just not caring at all because i fucking felt amazing and then we finished and i sat in disbelief thinking wow this is the sex people should be having and during the trip i saw myself laying facedown and instead of my bed i was on top of rock sort of like cave material and i saw myself from his perspective the back of my head but i had a headdress on like one an egyptian pharaoh would have the beautiful egyptian blue and gold colors and after we had finished he said he had seen the same thing like i somehow sent my trip visions to him telepathically or something he had not smoked dmt he was just on acid when that happened so i thought that was kind of crazy and weird then he took his dmt and i watched him trying to remember exactly what had just happened but disappointingly not being able to recall all of it when he was finished tripping it was around 6am and we just turned off the lights and tried to go to sleep fast forward about a month later began peeing a lot and breasts were sore i instantly knew i was pregnant so that night i bought a 2pk pregnancy test and the next morning i raced to the bathroom and did my thing then in about 30 seconds it didnt even take the whole 2 minutes i read pregnant in the clear black font i recalled that night about a month earlier and kinda just shook my head in amazement i didnt even think i could get pregnant and then i took that acid and dmt and somehow manipulated my boyfrienda penis to get an erection in 1 second and we conceived that night and i remember the dmt gods looking down at us as if they were observing to make sure we were doing everything right and i had an overwhelming feeling of approval and i had immediate assurance that i was doing exactly what i should be doing at exactly the right time now im 33 weeks pregnant due december 7th every day i look back at that day and try to comprehend it but i never can and i accept that but i still thank the dmt gods every day for letting me experience that "

ive written here before during one of my worse relapses im sober this time an hour ago i walked home from a nightclub left my boyfriend and friend to enjoy themselves and allowed myself to do what was best for me see i didnt want to drink hell i didnt even want to do drugs i definitely didnt want to be in a crowded place i was already dissociating badly and feeling incredibly anxious to be there my boyfriend told me i could get any drug i wanted he thought thatd make me feel better a week ago i wouldve been ecstatic about that i would have fooled myself thinking that drugs could make me feel better they dont actually make me feel better all drugs have truly done for me is destroy me thats what i wanted its all been for the most part to be self destructive even when its been fun thing is im done hurting myself 

i want to be sober ive done cocaine speed mdma weed in the past month though ive been continuing using just because i felt like i had to if that makes sense it took some time to understand that i actually dont want to use anymore a couple of months ago i went on yet another crazy and long speed bender where i really messed up almost to the point where i lost everything but i didnt i was forgiven and given another chance that changed something in me even though id done it all before i guess this was just the last straw for me

last time i was high was last weekend smoked weed again after a long break ive only smoked a couple of times this year i used to smoke chronically i wanted to know what it was like again and oh boy it was just too much and yet not enough

every time ive been high lately its been either overwhelming or disappointing i guess im over seeing drugs with heart shaped glasses you know every day ive woken up sober again ive been happy and relieved to be sober even if im dealing with severe mental illness and my life is a mess i still am happy to be sober i cant believe that this just happened on its own i tried to force this change and turns out it just happened when i wasnt trying to force it you know for over a year ive wanted nothing but to be high i used to be convinced that i couldnt deal with being sober that its awful to be sober well turns out its freaking amazing to be sober to be in control of yourself is the best thing there is

walking home i realised that drugs cant give me what i want i dont even know what i want ive been looking for something my whole life something to fill the void and now im starting to accept that i dont need to fill it not like this chasing madly after something i cant even define all this time i thought i was chasing happiness sanity whatever now its clear to me ive been chasing the exact opposite ive been hurting and hurting myself wondering why i feel so empty and broken ive been breaking myself and continuing this awful cycle i dont want to do that anymore be it drugs or other things im done doing that to myself


i dont want to fool myself with the idea of casual use i cant do that when i use i want to keep going until i pull myself inside out until i get to a point where i slowly but surely slip into another psychotic break i get there even without drugs so its time to stop doing things that push me there quicker i dont want that anymore i dont want to fall apart i dont want to hit the bottom because ive already sunk lower than i ever thought i could and  i know now that i can always go lower and i just dont want to do that anymore im climbing back up every day ill probably stumble on the way but ill keep going on even if i fall down badly ill keep going on

im not giving up ill be frank a couple of weeks ago i had yet another suicide attempt planned been there done that way too many times this time it wouldve been successful 100 figured out a way ah but something changed an opportunity to start a new life was offered to me and that was enough to make me fight against that urge to kill myself its not easy and im not really happy most of the time i dont think that matters though what matters is that i live every day i fight against this suicidalness in me i know it will go away again and come back but i have control over myself as long as i stay sober and thats truly amazing to realise 

i just wanted to share these thoughts and this change in me and this is the best place for it i think

keep fighting

four years ago i overdosed for my third time four years ago i watched my best friend overdose and die four years ago i decided that i was sick of sitting in the back of cop cars of spending time in jail of burying my friends of waking up in the hospital of wasting away

i wasnt sure i could ever get sober i had spent two years trying i had a year sober once upon a time and had relapsed hard after a failed relationship  a petty reason in the grand scheme of things but i wanted any reason to return to my best friend i decided id likely die with a needle in my arm but four years ago i put that needle down and said that last goodbye to my friend heroin

i did the impossible  or so i thought  and got sober again
i stayed sober through long days at work rejection from friends fights with family the loss of a job mental health issues loneliness the loss of my first child i never thought id stay sober but here i am

hi recovered alcoholic and meth addict here just wanted to say hi and let anyone who wants to know that this recovery stuff works

when i finally realised through 20 years of bitter struggle and multiple attempts to control my drinking that i could not control or stop altogether i just wanted to know one thing 


can i have a cool life sober

the answer is yes


through a good 12 step sponsor working the steps in the book alcoholics anonymous helping others to work the steps
consistent meditation and prayer and doing service ie carrying the message at meetings prisons and detox facilities i found happiness fir the first time in my life

sobriety is real cool for me 

it has given me more power and peace than i have ever known as long as i stay in the trenches i believe i will stay sober and happy

thanks for being here its through people like yourselves that i have recovered and to stay recovered i just gotta keep giving it away

hello fellow redditors in recovery 

first time posting here hope you’re all staying strong and well and for those suffering hang in there and trust the process everyone is different and i don’t wish to drop anymore mindless motivational platitudes just if you really focus on fixing one domain of your life at a time things will improve and they’ll start to improve exponentially quicker than you think 

i don’t have too much to say just that i’m on the brink of 21 weeks and i’m feeling back to normal that is to say my body has reached homeostasis i’m sleeping well and i’m not assailed by wild and volatile mood swings just the normal kind good and bad days all that summer is here and is the time of my greatest happiness and comfort and i am grateful for every day that i’m not enslaved to 30mg oxy pills

one of the greatest things that’s helped me get through these past few months has been to engage myself in learning something i play music as a hobbyist and while i’m comfortable saying i’m pretty good there’s always something i can improve upon and to get lost for hours and to start seeing positive results from your efforts yields a very enduring sense of satisfaction time slows down and also speeds up it’s weird but as long as i’m learning something music some philosophy math whatever it may be i never regret the time spent it makes me feel renewed i guess like i’m in a process of becoming something new 

with great affection

1 there is no such thing as rock bottom i can always end up somewhere worse unless im dead

2 if i think to myself if x happened i would get clean then im not really interested in getting clean

3 i became a better liar a better manipulator and a better thief when my addiction was on the line

4 the first time i told someone i didnt feel relieved i felt scared that fear never went away

5 i didnt even trust my own promises so how could i expect others to trust in them

6 recovery is so goddamned slow

7 celebrate each day as if it were a 1 year anniversary

8 a bad day sober is still 10 times better than the worst day high

9 planning for the future helps me forget about the past

10 if they are still my friend hold them close thank them as often as possible and never let go because they loved me more than i loved myself


i hope this helps you guys even a little my experience was different though i was addicted from 20082014 on and off where i would have 67 really bad months then a month clean i ran out of money lost jobs lost family i ended up with a criminal record the moment i decided to get clean was prompted by something you might see as silly a moment with my aging and arthritic dog where i couldnt help him get up the stairs because my arms were too weak i know it sounds stupid but it was in that moment i realized that i couldnt care for anyone least of all myself and i needed to change no matter what your reason is stick with it remember it"

i know it may not seem like a lot compared to other peoples milestones but i am so proud to say ive been completely sober for three weeks

it all started with weed and drinking which then lead to a benzodiazepine addiction and frequent usage of dxm i was combining multiple drugs daily and was never sober for more than a day 

recently i overdosed on diphenhydramine benadryl and had to be hospitalized this was when i finally realized that my drug use was not just hurting myself but people close to me i was lying and hiding things from my friends and family i isolated myself from most of my family members and disappointed them immensely 

this subreddit has helped me so much in realizing that you really need to want to be clean to get sober like i said three weeks is not a lot compared to others but i feel great its like a huge weight has been lifted i just wanted to remind everyone to never give up although things may seem tough you will turn out a better person in the end"

11.7952795,-8.1118,Recovered,"eight years of xanax and finally had enough
i was 18 when i decided to get medicated for my anxiety boy was i naive i thought xanax could cure it all when in reality i really didnt need it as much as i thought i am an addict and the reality is that it was just another thing i could abuse

i had ramped up to about 7mg a day rather quickly all this being prescribed my psychiatrist had extensive research into using xanax for relief of anxiety  i have been on that regiment for around 7 years until recent reflecting on this time people didnt know the true me anymore emotions were sparse and i didnt even realize or care to realize even i never had to deal with problems because i never saw anything as a problem this proved difficult with relationships for me i was an emotional zombie

in the past year i had slowly been weening off my 7mg a day down to about 1mg i admit i stayed in this range because i was afraid of what the world is like without this medication the fear was too strong i had become weak from not knowing what it is like to deal with everyday problems because i had become a zombie i even got completely off it over the summer for about 3 weeks and had a pretty brutal panic attack and thats all it took to get me back on it back to 1mg and all that work was gone

this year is a turning point i had finally decided that enough was enough and i didnt need to rely on this medication any more

i dropped my dosage to 5 for a few months before and finally quit all together on february 3 2017

the past 2 months have been a blur a mix of depression and anxiety clutter my thoughts being completely off xanax has been one of the toughest things ever

mainly large amounts of regret seemingly stuck on remembering embarassing moments or regretful decisions this is the hardest it seems that i must relearn everything again how to feel and react in situations the inner monologue is ever more present

my sense of smell and taste has dramatically changed i notice a lot more details in every smell every food some beers ive had i cannot drink anymore because of the intense flavor

i notice things about myself i never noticed before certain ticks come out i am very sensitive to external stimuli bright lights make me jolt sometimes i have jolts just out of nowhere loud  sharp noises startle me more i attibute all of this to the withdrawals but am left wondering if maybe it is an unrelated issue i have i am irritable and my thoughts are everywhere as seen in the writing above even how much i jump around from thought to thought feeling crippled by anxiety i wonder if ill ever get to a point where i do not have to let it control my present mindset i practice being mindful and letting myself know that what i fear  regret will not help me in the present but just to try to learn from my experiences to better myself

i will say that my anxiety spikes a lot when smoking thc i have been smoking since i was a teenager and i guess i am now realizing what it really does to me i am not sure if this will pass in time but i guess i am slowly breaking away from my excessive smoking habits because of the negative effects of it i get stuck in my head more than ever finding it harder to break free of the spell of panic i was reading another post and saw that someone had success with cbd so i think i will try that i have had moderate success in the past with it

i dont know what im looking for by writing this or if anyone will even make it to this part but i guess i just wanted to share my experience thus far i just discovered this subreddit and until now i didnt have any way to relate to how i am feeling i generally do not post at all about anything but i am stepping out of my comfort zones in hopes that this helps meor even anyone else for that matter i am happy knowing that there is a place where i can relate to others on this road to recovery i am leaving giant holes in my story but will fill in any gaps if anyone is interested enough its a long road ahead of me but i just need to keep being patient with myself and remember to live in the present thank you for listening to my story
