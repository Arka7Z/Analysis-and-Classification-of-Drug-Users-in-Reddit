"Today I celebrate 30 years of sobriety
I got sober in 1988 when I was 17 years old.  I had been drinking daily for 9 years and had spent most of my time from the age of 12 up until that point as a runaway.  I found my path in AA (not saying that’s the only way, it’s just the way that worked for me).  I had to learn how to have fun, as well as how to live life on life’s terms.  The program and the fellowship I found there made that possible.  If you are new to this please know that not only is it really possible, but it is awesome too.  Life has been great!  I may not be a rich man, but I am surrounded by people that love me, I have two sons that have gotten to grow up with a sober father, and I look forward to every day.  Thank you all for the gift of this amazing life.",3

"1 Year Clean and Sober Today from Heroin Addiction!
Today marks one year clean and sober from the use of heroin and any other drug or alcohol. I started out life in Catholic school raised in a good neighborhood with a good family, proving that this disease doesn't discriminate. I had a lot of friends and I was the guy who said heroin addicts are dirty people I would never use a needle. Well I became that guy. Lifes only purpose was to get that next one and getting well was my only focus. Putting all important things in life like my daughter, my health and everything else on the back burner. I did a lot of bad things to a lot of good people that I truly do regret and have since made amends to. Without really getting into my war story, my story started out with a lower back injury that led to an addiction to percocets and xannex which eventually turned into a full blown heroin addiction, which lead to 3 accidental overdoses in 3 weeks. After being in and out of treatment a few times I finally got the help I desperately needed and wanted. I sat in Friends crisis Hospitals waiting room for 4 days because there we're no beds available sick as a dog but I made friends with a nice girl who let's just say helped me from being sick. I eventually got 28 days of treatment at a facility in West Philadelphia called Kirkbride which saved my life. I met a counselor there by the name of Darryl who was extremely passionate about recovery and his model was ""just do it"". That man, plays a buge part in my life with who I am today. Darryl encouraged me to write poetry because he saw something in me where I saw nothing. Today, I am working on a book of poetry to be published and be my first publication as an author (hopefully reaching a coffee table near you someday soon lol). I volunteer a lot of my time because I want to give back because it's important people know that recovery is possible and life does get better. Kirkbride offered a lot of good things that I got involved with such as the 12 step program which I completed in treatment to keep my mind from wandering. I met a lot of great people in the short period of time in treatment which helped me get through a lot. Most importantly I know who I am today. If I knew back then what I know today I probably wouldn't have gone through what I went through, but hey live and let live. Today I am the volunteer coordinator assistant at Pro Act (hoping to get hired) an organization that focuses on recovery principles and promotes the well being of others, where I am happy to wake up everyday and help addicts not only with my story but by getting people into treatment as well as helping with resumes, job applications. Today my main focus is helping others which helps me stay clean and for that I'm grateful. Everyday is a gift from the Lord and everyday above ground is a great day.

"It's midnight, so I have 8 fuckin years clean
It's been fucking crazy. In no way have the last 8 years been easier than the 8 years BEFORE I got clean. All I had to worry about then was getting the next fix or my next release date from whatever institution I was in.
 These years have been better, though. I've grown, I've discovered a career in tattooing, I've loved, I've lost, I've gone absolutely batshit crazy and hit a few soulcrushing bottoms clean, and I've survived them. 
 I've survived myself.
 This is the bottom line: I was a gutter junkie that other gutter junkies considered a threat and didn't want around. I was toxic to everything I touched. Everything. My family cut me off, I terrorized whole neighborhoods. But I got clean... And somehow I've stayed clean.
 I'm not some kinda badass. You know what's fucking badass? What is absolutely hard fucking core? 3 days clean... 10 days... 30 days clean. Keep at it, please. ""Don't give up before the miracle."" I couldn't get 3 days clean without being locked up, and even then I usually found a way.
 The moral of my little rant is that if an addict like ME can get and stay clean, ANY ADDICT CAN.

"Alcoholic, crack, coke etc, but now about to get an MBA. It gets better.
[http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com](http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com)

I can't believe that I'm about to earn my MBA. I had fucked up my life pretty bad. I flunked out of college and became a raging drug addict / alcoholic. I lost so many jobs, apartments, friends, my self respect and I lived really hard for a couple of decades. My life was filled with alcohol, drugs and during that time I also did stand up for 15 years, starting in Austin, and then working at the Comedy Store in La Jolla for 3 years.

I went back to school at the age of 41, attending Houston Community College, and I earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Houston in 2015 at the age of 45.  I was still drinking every day, throwing up in the bathroom, and sometimes doing blow before an exam. I wasn't able to walk away from booze and coke until I started my MBA program. Yeah, I partied a long time, thought that my brain was fried, but then I just started with one Spanish class. Just one class. I made an A and then that started to help me build self-confidence.

I thought that my earlier drug use dictated my future, but no...fuck that. You can change the direction of your life. It may take a long time, but it can be done. I used to smoke crack playa.

I share all of this and how it all started with my early speech problems, bullying, depression, and anxiety on my blog [http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com](http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com)

"9 months clean from benzos, heroin, and meth
I started doing drugs 17 years ago and I never stopped. I have the same story as everyone else. I thought I was different. I thought that I wouldn’t ever be addicted.

At first, I started taking benzos and drinking. Then I added painkillers and adderall. My tolerance kept getting higher, and eventually I started shooting heroin and meth.

I lost my wife and kids, my career, my house, and my car. I pawned every single thing that I found around my house that was valuable before I had to move in with my mom. Then I started taking things from her house.

I fucking traded canned goods and leftover pizza that I took out of her kitchen for dope.

I wallowed in a pit of misery and isolation for a few months. I was talking to a friend one night about how I was sick of feeling like this. She said, “you need to go to rehab.” I thought about it and finally said ok and just started bawling. Up until this point, I knew I was an addict, but I had resisted the idea of rehab. 

I went.

I’ve been clean for 9 months now. I got back into my career and my daughter moved in with me.

I’d like to say everything is amazing, but it’s not. I’ve had some really bad things happen. But it’s so much easier to deal with the bad things when you’re not wallowing in guilt and shame. 

I struggle with anxiety and bouts of depression and urges to self-medicate those conditions.

But I took the advice of my counselor this time and went into a halfway house for women in recovery after rehab. I was there for 9 months. Hard work indeed but so very worth it. I was a tough case but the time allowed me to suspend all of my preconceived notions about my disease and get sober. I have found a new freedom and a new happiness. Only way I got here is through grace and agreeing to do what I didn't want to do. Hope anyone struggling finds the grace to do the same. Thanks for letting me share.",3

"it’s officially been one year xanax free.
hi guys,

I don’t usually do this kind of thing but I feel compelled to share that it’s been exactly one year from today that I’ve been free of xanax. It was the most difficult experience i’ve ever had to deal with and I’ve battled heroin addiction at a young age yet I found this much harder...

I know how scary it is to think of a reality without benzos and the overwhelming fear of doing ANYTHING without it; the bouts of depression and anxiety when you realize that you’ve built a tolerance and physical dependence from taking it daily, then needing to take more just to minimize the rebound anxiety together with the constant questions of “how do you cope with generalized anxiety without it? social anxiety? how can I do ANYTHING without a benzo?” Eventually I was taking enough to knock me out until 12:00 pm the next day without hearing MULTIPLE alarm clocks. 

A year ago today I suffered a nervous breakdown from abusing benzos and amphetamines in order to keep up with my fast paced and abusive job (which I eventually quit) and checked myself into an outpatient program to get off the benzos. Once I tapered off xanax, I thought I was losing my mind. Once I tapered off klonopin, forget about it... I couldn’t drive. I couldn’t leave my house. I was terrified of the world around me. I couldn’t picture socializing or dealing with day-to-day life without a benzo. 

I honestly could not IMAGINE living my life without xanax and/or klonopin. I can’t even remember a life without it... yet today I’m free of all benzos for the first time since 2013 and I can honestly say I’ve never felt better. I can feel my emotions. I can be vulnerable if I want to. I can cry if I want to. My relationship with my boyfriend of 6 years and with my family has improved tremendously. I now have a new job and I feel more alert, focused and motivated to do well. I even went back to school to finish getting my bachelor’s AND I have even gone out of my way to ask my coworkers how their weekends were (this is huge for me) I am no longer a prisoner to benzos.

I just wanted to share this because I remember wanting to get off benzos but was just so consumed with fear and anxiety because the thoughts of being without it was too great. 

so for those of you who are attempting to taper off benzos or have been thinking about getting off of them, I just want you to know that these feelings are 100% normal. you are not alone and there is hope. if I can get off of them, so can you.

"10 Years Today! Recovered alcoholic / meth addict
Hey so, 

thanks to people like you ladies and gentlemen I am 10 years clean and sober today.

For those curious about how this was done and those who are new I'll explain as follows:

I had about 3 attempts in AA and NA, mainly just attending meetings and stuff but that alone didn't work.

It wasn't until I got tired of relapsing and got super desperate that I got a good sponsor and went through the ""clear cut directions showing how we recovered"" -pg 29 in the book 'Alcoholics Anonymous' that everything changed for me and I started to experience a recovery that was really enjoyable with happiness and other cool stuff.

The main thing today that keeps me sober is continuing to work the steps and help others to work the steps through sponsorship.

Even so, there have been times when fully entrenched in the program that I have had to get outside help including counselling because AA does NOT fix everything. 

But basically I was told at the beginning that 'misery is optional' and that there can be an awesome, fun & fulfilling life without drugs and alcohol. 

I love being sober. 

Thanks again everybody and keep up the good work :))

Im not sure my sobriety date, so i just consider it March 2016 as that was the month. Ive been battling with opiates since I was 15, and this is by far my longest clean period. I've never felt this stable since starting opiates! Over time, I have taken a deeper look at my relapses and what happened beforehand that lead to me spiralling out of control. Then the next step was to quash the chance of it happening before it grew unmanagable. The biggest thing for me was a clear pattern of stopping going to meetings, then stopping therapy. As I slowly stopped going, I slowly became more and more inclined to use. Id think it had been long enough so i could go out on my own, but recovery is a process and i was nowhere near ready to stop going. Meetings and counseling are a huge support system. Sometimes the subject of the groups doesnt matter, but the fact that youre going to a place for several hours with like-minded people focused on the same goal of sobriety as you really keeps you structured and successful. Just wanted to share bc im super proud of myself, and I am ready for a lifetime of sobriety. I hope you are all too. Anyone is welcome to PM me if they need any help. Love yall:)",3

"23 years sober this month
My sobriety date is 7/9/91. I have not been very active on these subs lately because of a crazy schedule, haven’t been to many meetings either, and just wanted to check in and share some things to keep me focused. 

I was 28 when I got sober after a 14 year drinking career, 10 of those years as a daily drinker, the last 5 mostly in isolation. I hated everything about who I was and the way I was living my life, but didn't know how to change it. I came out of a blackout (a common occurrence for me) in my apartment with the yellow pages open to treatment centers. I called an 800#. I don’t remember what I said but I’ll never forget what the lady on the other end said: “based on what you’ve described, in another 30 days you’re either going to be dead or you will have killed someone.” That was my moment of clarity, those words rang true to my core, I could see that train coming right at me. 

I got into treatment and learned that it’s the first drink I have to avoid. My experience tracks perfectly with the disease model of alcoholism: a mental obsession to start drinking coupled with an allergic reaction that makes it impossible to stop drinking. The thought of not taking the first drink had NEVER occurred to me. 

Relapse is not part of my story. I think it’s because the above experiences seared into my brain that drink = death. My brain does that quickly now, even with a little “oh wouldn’t a glass of chardonnay [my drink of choice] be nice with this dinner?” I know intimately how people struggle with relapse and am forever grateful that I’ve managed to avoid that. 

I’ve been pretty active in AA the entire time but haven’t done it perfectly. Years 8-11 I was mostly absent until I realized I was trying to justify why it would be OK to start smoking weed again. I knew where that would lead and got myself back to meetings. After a week of daily meetings my crazy and negative thinking had completely turned around. It’s still amazing to me how that works. For me, if I’m not checking in with other recovering alcoholics, I’m not hearing what I need to hear. 

I’ve had an amazing life so far, some of it horrible, lots of it fantastic. I’ve learned to be grateful for all of it. One of the most important lessons I’ve had in sobriety is the concept of relativity: an opposite has to exist for me to appreciate anything. If I was happy all the time, I wouldn’t know it. Grief is evidence that I love. Setbacks are evidence of prior success, and I can do it again. And I’ve had all of that. Have buried both parents, lost jobs, long periods of unemployment a couple of times, changing careers, all things in storage, living out of friends guest rooms for 2 years (this was years 10-12 of sobriety!), a confused straight marriage, a mostly successful gay relationship that ended tragically, with me finding him dead in bed from an overdose. And drinking never occurred to me during any of that because I know today it doesn’t solve anything, only makes everything worse. 

My life today is approaching fairy tale status. Three years into a highly successful relationship, an amazing job that pays very well, financially secure in a way I’ve never been, lots of travel, great friendships. And if I picked up a drink today that would all be lost. And if I don’t, in the back of my mind I know how relativity works: this too may pass anyway. And if it does, I’ll keep going and build again. I know today how to transform my life, I’ve done it now several times over. That’s what I wanted when I came into recovery: a transformed life. Life is 10% what happens and 90% how I respond to it. AA set the stage for making that happen and I’ve done a ton of outside work to keep it going. 

I still work with a handful of sponsees who seem to want what I have; I’m only going to meetings 1-2x a month now because of a wild work schedule with lots of business travel and also working on a masters degree. I chaired a major recovery conference in 2013 and frankly am appreciating the break. We’ll see how long it lasts. 

What hasn’t changed is my daily reflection that I’m an alcoholic who can’t drink today, and every day I need to do something that keeps me balanced and focused: some reading, a little meditation, get to the gym, eat right, stay in touch with close friends – alcoholic or not. 

And this morning, this was what I needed to do to stay focused. Thanks for reading.

"Two years ago today was the last time I picked up a drink or a drug.
1-25-11 was the last time I ever picked up a drink or a drug. I was 15 years old, and I had just spent the last four months cheating rehab by smoking spice, and drinking the nights before the days I wouldn't get drug tested. But on this day two years ago, I decided to give it an honest shot. I joined AA, and worked the twelve steps. I found a home group, and I've made some of the best friends I could ever hope to have. I entered the program as a depressed, anxiety ridden 15 yearold tweaker, and today, I am a somewhat sane sober 17 yearold. I got into my program and didn't want to work it all. I wouldn't accept that I am an alcoholic, and I just stayed dry. When I told myself I'd give the program an honest shot, I mostly meant I would just stay sober. I wasn't gonna work any steps. But I wanted to keep my rehab happy, and my parents happy, so I got a sponsor and started the steps. To my amazement, even though I didn't give a flying fuck about the steps, they still worked. They kept me sober. And once I started to feel good about myself for the first time in my life, I started to care. I realized that I hated everything about myself, and for the first time in mylife I was happy, and I knew it was from the steps, and the fellowship, and from being of slight service at my meetings. From that point on, i started to give a shit. I still give a shit, and today I have two years sober. If you're new to program, just keep coming back. Go through the motions no matter how uncomfortable. The program works, it really does. It worked for me, and I was resisting it. I didnt want it to work, and it did. If it will work for someone like me, I can't even imagine how well it works for someone who truly wants it, right from the start.

My name is John W, and I'm an alcoholic. Thanks for letting me share.

When you would casually laugh it off when people commented that you put on weight because even when you started getting a belly and it was because you were actually getting healthier and eating. I can never imagine how hard it must have been to distance yourself from your friends who tried to influence you back into your old lifestyle which I know would have been so easy at times. I know you've said to me that today is more important to you than your birthday and even bigger than your cake day. So I hope you are proud of yourself today and everyday because you've made it one more year and I will still be proud of you 50 years from now and even though I'm not standing in your corner I am still cheering you on.

"2 years sober 1 day at a time
Well, today marks 2 years of consecutive sobriety for me, all achieved 1 day at a time. For that reason, I guess I don't *feel* any different today, just like how I didn't *feel* any different after 1 year.  I will say that the big difference between my first and second year of sobriety is; 1st year meetings and fellowship is really what kept me sober. 2nd year *service* is what kept me sober.  I was a very low bottom case. Eviction, homelesness, psych ward, a night in jail ... And today, I have a small but nice apartment downtown, I'm back in school for something I love, and I have relationships with friends and family.  I am eternally grateful for these things and they are in large part because of AA and surrender. For anyone struggling, please just keep coming back. The promises *do* come true, and it does get better.  ***Edit. Thanks for all the kind responses! :) Forgot to ad, and I feel like it is important for others to read, when I first came in to AA I was 25. I am 27 now. I was then, and am still now, thought of by most as young. Which may be true as you don't see a lot of young people in AA that stick around. I share this so other younger people who think they couldn't possibly get or stay sober that age has no effect on this. It may get harder as you get older. Recovery at any age is possible. ",3

"Today Marks My 3 Year Anniversary
2 1/2 years ago, during the Christmas holidays, I found myself alone in my grandmothers house. I was strung out on cocaine, smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking vodka as if it were water.  I was in possession of a gun and in one of the lowest moments of my life- I considered that as my only option out.

At that point I had been battling depression, drug addiction and alcoholism for almost 10 years. I would have some short stints of clarity and sober time, but it never lasted and the consequences of my actions were becoming more severe. 

Back to me sitting in my grandmothers bathtub holding a bottle of vodka in one hand and a gun in the other- I just couldn’t imagine my life getting any better.  Thankfully, and miraculously, my 2 yr old cat came around the corner and just started meowing, and he just kept meowing until I got up and went over to pet him. He sat on my lap and wouldn’t get up- I wound up passing out with my back against the wall and my cat on my lap. 

6 months later I finally hit a legal consequence that jolted me enough to consider seeking help. It took what it took to get me sitting in a room, full of strangers, listening to people who had similar stories to mine. I told myself I would give this a shot, just for 6 months and then I’ll decide if I wanted to keep doing this. I wound up detoxing on my buddies couch, moved into a house full of sober people, and started making meetings.

In the beginning I took all the suggestions, worked the program to the best of my ability and 3 years later I am so incredibly grateful. I didn’t just get my life back- I was given a whole NEW life.

This past year has been rough, a lot of changes have occurred and I gotta be honest, the same enthusiasm I had 3 years ago for the program isn’t at the same level. There have been times this past year where I found myself tempted to pick up and drink again. What has saved me is my unwavering faith in a power greater than myself. No matter how often or far I may stray, I concede to my inner most self that I am an alcoholic/drug addict and I will never be able to drink/drug “normally” and that my God will always show up, even in the darkest of times. I have to believe those two things or I surely would relapse and I’m not guaranteed a seat back. 

It is possible. There is always hope to be found and we can and do recover. ❤️",3

So I picked up my six month chip today, in my home group. I have looked forward to this day with great anticipation. About how amazing it would be. Shit, even my sponsor showed up unannounced, she didn't know it was my 6th month anniversary and we rarely go to the same meetings. Everything was set up for success. It was gonna be a great meeting and my share was going to be fantastic. 

But I feel so hollow. Drained and apathetic. Like I couldn't really give a fuck. I do everything that I should be doing. I go to meetings almost every day, I have a great relationship with my sponsor. I do service at two meetings. I have a good network of fellow addicts. I work the steps. All of that shit. But I still feel empty. I don't want to use and I want to stay clean but I have cravings every day. I feel like there are so much work left. I'm six months in and I just want this shit to be over. Because I have a lot of work to do. Deep, uncomfortable, hard work. And I'm a person of quick fixes. I keep looking for the shortcuts and that's not what this program is about. I have responsibilities now. And to be honest being the best version of yourself is fucking exhausting. Overwhelming. I guess I miss not giving a flying fuck about anything at all like in my active addiction, in a sense shit was a lot easier back then. 

I can always go back, I know that. But I don't want to go back. My life was horrible and I don't want to use. But these fucking cravings man. I want them gone. Ultimately I'm glad and relieved I'm staying clean but there are just some days where I wanna throw everything away and get fucking plastered. But just for today I'm clean.

"22 years and 3 days sober, let's give a hand to judasblue and SOmuch2learn for their spiritual giantness, er, moderating prowess!
[Spiritual Giant!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6cqfuj/i_cant_stand_some_people_in_aa_it_makes_me_not/dhwvgf7/)

Ok, my homegroup meets on Friday and my sobriety bday was Saturday, so no image of a 22 year coin just yet.

The recurring theme in my life recently is that temporary is only temporary, not permanent.  I keep seeing a lack of patience popping up on the various recovery subs in Reddit so now I'm starting to pound that topic in my weekly meeting.  I forget the angst and impatience of early sobriety but certainly understand the benefits of staying the course, doing the next right thing, and accepting the results (generally ridiculously positive results at that).

Alright, enough about me for a moment...

Let's give a hand to /u/judasblue and /u/SOmuch2learn for the bang up job of moderating this place!  I do a little here and there but they're the ones handling the majority of the spam and moderator requests.  /u/Program_Buddhist has been AWOL for a couple years now, but he's good stuff so let's see if he shows up before 2020 or so.

We're one of the smaller ""recovery"" type subs but I think they help run a tight, focused ship.

"Happy 1 Year to Me!!! :D
I made it, you guys!!! 1 year and 7 days to be exact today. Life has been soooooo different from what I used to be. There’s still more work to be done, but I’ve learned to follow direction. Hallelujah!  Can you believe that? I guess all the “self-will run riot” did pay off. It actually taught me to take direction from my sponsor and those that I respect. I didn’t know any better honestly. If I did, I would have done better. That’s my new motto, and I’m sticking to it. Haha!

Anyway, I am super excited, and I’m working on Year 2, one day at a time. 

How’d I do it? I’ll tell you. I went to a meeting almost every day for the entire year. I worked the steps with my sponsor. I got involved in H&I. I didn’t hang with using friends, or at bars or clubs. I immersed myself in my hobbies and career goals. I dated around which was not a good thing, but it was really another addiction for me. This year, I’m staying single. I’m over dating honestly. I can’t commit for the life of me, and people tend to piss me off. Ya, that’s right, I’m a hater. I just hate. But I’m working on it. Can’t work on it until you accept it right? I meditate like 20 mins every other night, and pray here and there, and try to keep a positive attitude. Progress is very gradual for me, but I am much better than the monster I used to be. 

Sending blessings to all the sufferers out there! Keep your head up, and your hopes high. It DOES get better!!!

I went to a meeting just about every day for my first year. I got a sponsor while still in rehab and started step work while still in rehab. I got in the middle of the program and picked up many service positions. And by the grace of some power greater than me I am still clean today. I truly thought I would die using. Today my life is what I never would have imagined. I had a baby, who is now a little toddler and I now know what true love is. I am going back to school to finish my degree after finally emailing my old advisor to ask if it was possible. And by some miracle my boss gave me a killer Christmas bonus that pays my tuition.

"At midnight it will be 37 years sober.
One man's story.
(warning: wall of text)
OK, so it's now 37 years sober and the first thing anyone asks, that is if they're at all interested, is ""how did you do it?""

The simple answer would be that I didn't, but my Higher Power did.

A less simple answer would be that I was lucky enough to realize I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and so I did what AA in its collective wisdom told me to do.

So what was the trigger?  To this day I don't honestly know. I had been hospitalized twice with DTs and was given up for dead or at least near-dead once. But, hey, I'm an alcoholic so I did what alcoholics do when they get out of the hospital -- I drank just like I always did, about a fifth of cheap vodka a day.

Then, drunk as a skunk on Valentine's Day I jumped into the car with my wife and headed across a snowy Wyoming Valley to the local detox center.  No, not some expensive rehab center, but a dirty, grungy stop-of-last-resort for the area's drunks.

My wife was appalled at the treatment I got, enough so that she was launched into a near-20-year career in the drug and alcohol field. I do know they took my shoes away, all the while telling me I was free to leave anytime. Yes, sure, with 4"" of snow on the ground on the side of a mountain.  Most of my detox stay remains a blur. I do know I was sick and miserable and slept a lot.

Then, on the last day -- by this time I'd earned a pair of corduroy slippers -- I went to my first AA meeting. It was mandatory, by the way. Not much registered except that the key to sobriety was 90 meetings in 90 days. I also picked up the nugget that my only job was to stay sober.

Not being a particularly religious sort I wasn't really into the spiritual aspects of the program, but deep inside I knew that something outside of myself was keeping me sober. So, OK, let's call it my Higher Power, whatever it might be.

They told me I'd probably lose my drinking buddies. They were right, I did, but it really wasn't a great loss. I had this enduring and unrealistic fear that if I went into a bar someone from AA would see me and I'd get my ass kicked. So I didn't.

Years go by. By the time I had 12 years sober I reasoned that I'd maybe gotten a little walking-around sense that could be of use to AA, which by then I realized had saved my life. So I did all the service jobs, and I mean almost all. I never became the District Chairman, but I came close.

Meetings every week became the norm. They kept telling me that maybe I didn't need a meeting every week, but it was good insurance. That was enough for me.

By 30 years it became apparent that I'd finally found a new way of life and alcohol wasn't a part of it. I was firmly convinced that I was like a black man -- I could change the status, but I was still black, only in my case the word isn't black, it's alcoholic. 

Where to now at 37 years?  I realize I have more years behind me than ahead of me -- life is like that. I'm still wedded to the alcoholic community -- bought tires today from a guy who'se an alcoholic. Why? Because unlike most tire salesmen, I knew he was honest. Guess that's a fringe benefit.

Why am I posting this wall of text? 

Not for self aggrandizement, I assure you. Maybe it's to show newcomers or mid-termers that long term sobriety is quite do-able even though the first steps seem insanely difficult. I figure if just one person decides to challenge me and stay sober for 37 years and one day it will have been a worthwhile exercise. Especially since one day -- today -- is all we really have.

"Some of what have I learned in 45 years of sobriety
What have I learned in 45 years of sobriety? 

(In no particular order) 

Nothing original - most learned in little rooms with big books – from giants. 

I can be my own worst enemy.

Listen, to everyone, at least long enough to find out if they have anything worth saying. 

It’s not my job to judge, or to be judged.

We are almost always stronger, smarter than me. 

I owe my life to others. It wasn’t me that got me sober, I didn’t know how to.

The unexamined life is not worth living – Socrates

Apologize, as quickly as possible.

Some people seem to be meant to be bad examples, try not to be one of them.

Be harder on yourself than on others, then learn to go easy on yourself.

You’re not perfect, nor are you supposed to be.

The worst lies I ever told were to myself. 

There is life after drinking, a much better one.

Always say please and thank you.

Ask.

Whenever possible do unexpected kindness for someone

Before acting on a bright idea, ask others. 

Some of the worst advice I ever got came from me to myself. 

I’m worth it.

Trust nothing you were taught without examination. Some things you learned, were taught, are just not true. It’s your job to figure those out. 

Choose your friends wisely.  They are the ones who can save you or kill you.

Learn to forgive others so you can forgive yourself. 

For those with a religious bent: If you regard yourself as a child of God, however you conceive that, think it through. Your God is referred to as some kind of king, and your spiritual father.  If your ‘father’ is a king, what does that make you? You need never again bow your head to no one. - Carlotta Mercedes Agnes McCambridge – Mercy McCambridge – Sullins College, Bristol VA, 1974",3
"Today I found the silver lining of my substance abuse
I'm 14 weeks pregnant and am currently in the ER because I'm pretty sure I have kidney stones.

I finally got called to the back a few hours ago and--since this is a university hospital--I had a student paramedic trying to place my IV. He was struggling with getting a vein to register, so I took a deep breath and said, ""Try above my tattoo, at the edge of my elbow crease. Use that old stretch mark to guide you. The vein runs alongside it."" He stared at me blankly. I looked away momentarily and said, ""That's the vein I used to slam heroin. It'll register. I promise.""

He looked at me with the utmost gratitude/respect and said, ""I will trust you then."" Lo and behold he got the IV in.

He seemed kinda flustered with himself for taking so many tries. I looked at him and said, ""Hey, for what it's worth, don't beat yourself up. Everyone has to start somewhere and at least I wasn't a middle aged soccer mom demanding to speak to your supervisor."" We both chuckled. ""Besides,"" I continued, ""I'll be 60 days clean on Sunday and you helped me make peace with my history of substance abuse. Today I was able to help you. You best believe that I'll be talking about this at my next meeting."" He smiled and congratulated me on my recovery. He told me one of his close friends just celebrated 3 years. It inspired me to keep fighting the good fight for my unborn son, for my family and friends, for myself, and even for the strangers I'll meet and unknowingly help along the way.",4

1)  I won't spend/lose a crazy amount of money on drinks/tips; 

2)  I won't slur my words and speak nonsense;

3)  I won't  drive with one eye closed so I don't see double; 

4)  I won't return home tonight in a black out and fall into bed fully clothed; 

5)  I won't wake up with a jolt of fear, wondering what I did the night before; 

6)  I won't be nauseous and spend the day vomiting; 

7)  I won't feel like shit about myself.

Today will be one more day of my 8-1/2 years of sobriety, and I'm clear-headed, confident and hopeful. Sure, I'm working on a Sunday and I'm not thrilled about that, and yes, I'm dealing with my mom's end-stage Alzheimer's which is a gut-wrenching experience. But I don't need alcohol to get me through any of it. In the early years of my struggle to get sober, I started my battle with the help of rehab, intensive outpatient programs, some AA, and therapy. It was not easy and I was a very angry woman. Today, I'm not so angry. Today I have my life back. Today I see the possibilities. Today, I have hope.",3

"First sober thanksgiving in three years.
This time of year is especially hard for me, because yesterday was me officially hitting one year sober. For the past three thanksgivings, I've relapsed or been high the night before and fallen asleep at my family's get together. I'm so happy that I'm sober and able to truly see my family not spun out of my mind. I'm grateful for my recovery, but these months are so damn hard. Looking back fondly at my using/the memories I have with using is one of my worst habits but it's hard not to sometimes. The support I got for posting about almost hitting one year was amazing, I feel safe posting here so it's helpful to vent and get it out. 

Anyways, I just wanted to let everyone know that if you struggle with your sobriety around the holidays/winter months like I do, you're definitely not alone. Hope you all have a good thanksgiving and stay strong through this time. ",3

"As of July 13 I've now been clean and sober for a year. It's been a good ride, let's see where it goes from here
I'll tell you what man, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that I can't see around corners. I have no idea what's coming next. I love to make all these plans, and then the plan suddenly changes. Some times it works out tho. When I was in treatment, I made full plans to get out, spend a couple days partying hard, and then kill myself. That was just *the plan*, because there was no way I could even imagine a life clean. But then the plan changed. I took some suggestions, I did some work, and here we are.

You know at a lot of 12 step meetings, the secretary will mention to turn off your cell phone and keep side talk to a minimum so someone won't miss the one thing that might save their life that night. I remember hearing that, and I started listening intently for that one thing that would save my life. So I listened, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited.... and I never  heard ""that one thing."" It really wasn't what anyone said that gave me hope, I couldn't possibly tell you what they said. It's what I saw. I saw a bunch of addicts and alcoholics living and enjoying life without the use of drugs. They were happy, joyous, and free. That's what gave me hope. So I'm gonna stick around in recovery and help some people out. Thanks for 1 year guys.",

6 years ago I felt lucky to have swiped a tent to live in while I posted up behind a Walmart contemplating where my life will lead. Thanks to a loving family and some dedicated members of recovery I was given yet another chance to turn it all around. Throughout this journey I’ve been able to cross the threshold of various different milestones, some joyous and some painful, throughout it all I never would have dreamed that the day would come when I would be able to buy a home by myself without needing a handout. 

I’m happy to say that that day has arrived. Today I bought a home.

I’m living proof that an addict...ANY addict...can stop using, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live. Today I’m able to be an acceptable, responsible, productive member of society. 

A huuuuuge heartfelt thank you to everyone who has ever taken the time to guide me, love me, and teach me. I love all of you. Today is a celebration for all of us. We DO recover.

"NA is mindblowing
I'm 50 years fucking old and got hooked on Kratom.  This, after being clean for a year where my last DOC was alcohol.  Lots of shit before that which didn't involve needles.  But if you can snort it, swallow it, or stick it up my ass for better effects, I was probably hooked on it.  

After realizing I needed a different approach, and FINALLY accepting that maybe I don't actually know everything, I figured I'd try NA.  Now I did a few AA meetings when I quick drinking, but just could not buy into it.  The meetings I went to had too many folks saved by Jesus.  Which, honestly, I really wish the fuck I could be.  But I wasn't, and therefore I stopped going.  PLUS...I was still in control with AA just a tool that I utilized.  

This time I was more spiritually mature, having finally making a connection to a God that I believe in...one that is in me as well as everything else.  Plus, I no longer wanted to control this quit or my addiction.  Fucking done with that shit.  

I promised myself to do 30 meetings in 30 days in hopes that maybe I would get lucky and find 1 meeting that maybe I could tolerate.  This is a great example of how setting expectations just does not work.  I expected 29 shitty meetings.

My intitial plan was to do both NA and AA.  The first meeting I went into was an NA meeting.  Where again, my expectations was that I was going to find saved people or a bunch of people who could not help themselves.  

Immediately, all expectations were blown out the window.  Right from the very second I walked through the door.  An absolute mind-blowing experience.  

For the first time in my life I was surrounded by people who knew me.  They knew everything about me because I summed up my life in 4 words: I am an addict.

They knew I thought I was smart as fuck and thought I could figure this out.  They knew I over analyzed and thought too deep into things.  They knew I was obsessed with fixing the one problem I thought I needed to fix.  They knew everything about me. 

Normally I don't like to socialize.  I find it difficult to hold a conversation unless I'm drunk or high.  For sure, nobody wants to talk about what's on MY mind.  Except in NA.  It's so damn easy to approach somebody.  And better yet, they approach ME!  And GENUINELY want to get to know me better.  

I am on going to my 16th meeting tonight.  I've made the effort to visit a different meeting every night so I can see what's going on in my area.  Every single one of those meetings has been absolutely awesome.  With easily half of them being ones that I can call home.  

Anyway...
I've been over at quittingkratom and saw this subreddit group and figured I'd see what's up.  Couldn't help myself in declaring my love for NA.  Thank you for listening.",4

"Off of heroin 5 years, doing well
I was in a very bad place as a young adult. I went from being a chronic stoner and SEVERE alcoholic as well as a pill user from age 14 to 21, to being a heroin addict from 21 to 25. I hurt my mind and body badly during those years. I went 9k in credit card debt at one point. I experienced some extremely dark and awful times. There were many points when I didn't think I would make it. All of us here know the daily living nightmare of having a serious addiction.


After inpatient rehab I went into recovery and started taking suboxone. I got off suboxone for a short time and went through severe withdrawal without knowing it. It was a different withdrawal from heroin; Instead of physical pain, I just mentally couldn't function. I started drinking again heavily to cope. Eventually I chronically smoked crack for about 2 months. I never felt like my life was in more danger than during those 2 months. Crack is a disgusting drug, and I regret ever trying it. I got back on suboxone and leveled out. 


I got into school for x-ray. School was difficult. I relapsed a couple times when I tried and failed to quit suboxone. All of my schoolmates (12 girls, I was the only guy) were squeaky-clean conservative robots of efficiency who didn't understand at all when I went through hard times. I lost all my friends. I distanced myself from the friends who used, and the friends who didn't use distanced themselves from me. School was kind of its own nightmare at times. I realized that I couldn't quit suboxone and be successful in school as the withdrawals lasted so long. 


I made it through however, and finally got a job in another town 2 hours away as a 3rd shift xray tech. 3rd shift was hard for me, as my mind had taken such a beating that it didn't really deal with sleep deprivation well. At 8 months in, I started burning out very quickly. 


Luckily at that time, a 2nd shift position opened up. It was there that I started finding myself. I discovered how to take suboxone appropriately and how to mind my sleep hygiene so that I could function as close to 100% as someone like me can get. People actually started LIKING me, and being happy when they saw me. I adopted two cats. I became one of the best employees in the department. My manager started talking me up to her colleagues in the hospital and the MRI manager started catching me in the halls trying to convince me to join MRI. I finally accepted an interview and was hired. I now have good income, I'm free of credit card debt, I'm free of drugs and alcohol, and most of the time I'm pretty happy and proud of myself.


Life is still hard sometimes. On the weekends I'm so exhausted sometimes I just lay in bed the whole day. I get brain fog occasionally if I don't sleep properly. I have to watch my sleep hygeine like a hawk to make sure I'm sharp enough to do my job. Sometimes I just lay in the bottom of the shower for half an hour because it's all I really want to do. No one at work knows my secret past and sometimes that's hard, but it's the way it has to be. I can be quite introverted. My whole immediate family still suffers from addiction problems and disfunctionality.


On the good days however (which are getting more and more common), I'm extremely proud of how far I've come. I paint and draw, I play video games, I'm learning a new language.  I have my own place, my own awesome king-sized bed. I have my two adorable, loving cats. I thank the stars for my mom and dad who never gave up on me along the way. I'm thankful that through a combination of luck and chance I never ended up with any criminal record. I still have my body in good shape, and my brain is slowly recovering. I feel like a real person now. 

I think some day I might end up being truly happy. It's always one step at a time for me. I've heard that your 30s is the best time of your life. I hope that will be true for me. My hard times occur less and less, although I know for someone like me the hard times will always be there now and then. I'm planning a trip to Iceland to see family this summer and I'm getting very excited for it. Things might just turn out alright. 


Thanks for reading my story. ",3

If I do what those before me and around me do, if I talk to someone, if I read something, if I try to do something good/spiritual, if I do some type of recovery activity, I have a great chance of staying clean and sober like I have for these past IX years.

I would like to celebrate wildly my escaping the jaws of death, but after all these years, I have seen too many people die locally and on the world stage. 

So, I will joyfully eat some cake and raise a cup of coffee for those we lost.  Here's hoping that I never forget just how cunning, baffling, and powerful our disease it. [Number nine - number nine - number nine -](https://imgur.com/a/jEU8Ue2#bsxLLb1)",3

I was 60 days clean. He had 6 mths. We had so much in common... Not just drugs-not just recovery. I thought he was my twin. He said he loved me. He wanted to live with me.

He kept all our friends. I had to choose a new home group and go to different meetings. I was in HIS back pocket for 4 years instead of my SPONSORS back pocket where I should have been. I made him my Higher Power. I called my dealer the 1st night he was gone. She told me to eff off. I had lied and stolen from her too much. Thank God she wouldn't see me. It was my HP doing for me what I couldn't do for myself. It's been almost a year since he left. I didn't relapse... I just celebrated 5 years clean. There's a reason they suggest you don't get into a relationship when you first get clean. We suck at relationships. I need to have a relationship with me and get to know me before I can have one with any man again. I'm enjoying hangin out with me. I'm enjoying getting to know me. I think I might actually love me.

I had many relapses, but on January 31, 1996, I made the decision to stay clean no matter what. I've been able to do that one day at a time. Some days it's easy, and others I feel like I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth.

"Program Bashing Will Get You Banned
This sub exists as a supportive place for all redditors in recovery. 

Unfortunately, we have been seeing a spate of posts and comments lately that come down to NA sucks or AA sucks. There are plenty of folks who feel that way about some branch of 12 step practice. They have stories and examples from their own experience, or in lieu of same spread random tales they have heard. 

Your mod team has long term clean time in both programs. We are examples that both of these programs work. And we have an open mind about the various 12 step programs we haven't been in, because we have witnessed the steps work and it would appear that different people are attracted to different particular groups working them. 

Posts and comments that are highly divisive will be removed. If they are particularly bashing on the face of them or repeated, the poster will be banned.

This isn't negotiable. The wonderful thing about reddit is that you don't even need a resentment and a coffee pot to start a new community, you just need the resentment. The RiR community is about inclusiveness and support. You want one that is about your chosen path being The One True Way, it takes only a few clicks to start your own sub and start bashing away.

EDIT: 

This post was prompted by a spate of recent postings that were specifically NA vs AA crap. We encourage people to be reasonably respectful here period tho. And yes, that does include being respectful to those folks who are traveling a different path than the 12 steps. A lot of people have a lot of emotional investment in their path, for good reason. We can disagree on approach, and not be asshats to each other.",0

I moved to a new town (but not too far from where I was living before) and I still have yet to go to meetings there. I'm grateful I was able to stay clean. I felt like my birthday meeting was more of an apology to my friends and myself. This year was only hard because I chose not go to meetings. Despite all that it was great to be back and my best friend gave me a card with a chip in it that was his dad's. His dad had been sober for over 35 years and passed away almost 3 years ago. I started crying in the meeting when I read that the medallion was his dad's. My friend still struggles with the most of his dad and it meant so much to me that he gave me his 4 year medallion. The friends I've made have been the greatest group of people I've ever met.",4
"When life sucks at 20+ years sober....a conversation about long term sobriety
Phillip Seymour Hoffman's relapse and death has rocked my world. He also had 20+ years sober. Then he relapsed and it killed him quickly.  He's not the only one. And then there are those that kill themselves.

To be sure, there are lots that never relapse and die a sober death.

However, my friends and I have talked about some of the buggaboos that hit us when sober a long time.  Here's a short list:

1)Feeling like you can't be honest in a meeting because you are concerned that others with less time will be discouraged if you are having a hard time.

2)Difficulty finding sponsorship

3)Lack of crisis options


I literally have no shame, so I talk in meetings regardless. I know that it has scared some people and I will often address that in the talk. But if the newbies keep showing up they will see that the program has given me tools to MAKE IT THROUGH. The tools are the same at 1 day as they are at 50 years.  Don't drink, work steps, go to meetings, work with others.


I went without a forma sponsor for a couple of years because there aren't many women that have long term sobriety that have time to sponsor in my time. I asked them all. They all turned me down citing lack of time.  At the time I was going through a divorce and I think they were concerned that I would take a lot of support.  So I got a therapist and kept in good touch with my friends. I spread ""it"" around so no one got burned out. And I got through it

I have a sponsor now. She is older than me, but has a about 10 years less sobriety.  But what she has is great and good life experience. So we have gone back through the steps together. It's been great.


Crisis care is harder. There have been times that I felt that if someone wasn't watching me, I might relapse.   I ended up begging my way into co-dependency outpatient program when I had about 3 years because I was so shaky.  The treatment centers wouldn't take me unless I relapsed, which seems backwards to me.  I wish that there was some place where people could go and get residential support  BEFORE they drink or BEFORE they kill themselves.  If you know of any, let me know.


Lastly,  I try to share that sobriety is just that - sobriety. It is not a magic ticket to a Disney movie.  Life continues.  Good, bad - always different.  It is just a lot easier to navigate sober than dead drunk.

Stay safe people.  You are loved.",4

"12 years clean and sober, just successfully took narcotics as prescribed
I had a bad mountain biking accident 2.5 weeks ago with a terribly painful, infected leg wound. I was communicative with my medical professionals about my history and honest with my sponsor. I took 10 days of oxycodone AS PRESCRIBED (every 4-6 hours). My husband (a sober alcoholic) helped me with the timing. Yes, it made me nervous, yes, I had physical feelings and side effects of addiction very quickly, and yes, I felt depressed getting off them. I moved to tramadol as needed for a few days and now am free of pain meds. 

My DOC was alcohol but I would and did use any downer. I just feel blessed to have the support and resources that I do today. If this had happened 12 years ago, I'd be on a prodigious bender mixing alcohol and narcotics, with no understanding job, no sick leave, no health insurance, no loving spouse, no support from other alcoholics, extremely limited self-care skills, and no spiritual defense. 

It is a result of working the 12 steps with a sponsor that I have these things today and am able to live life on life's terms.

"Just made my 30 days.
My key tag say ""Clean and Serene for thirty days""  And though I've been clean for thirty days.  I doubt I've been very serene.  I've tried, I really have.  But I don't know how serene I can really be in only the first thirty of my recovery.  I have so much left to learn, I haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg, and I'm so excited for the rest of my life.  I just finished doing some step-work and really wanted to share a bit.  With out people in recovery I don't think I would have made it.  I'm not talking about just clean, but thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind.  Thank god for every miracle in recovery.  By miracle I mean you guys, us.  It took me six months to get thirty days, and it would have been so much easier to just get clean when I first decided to.  I realize I wasn't ready back then, but in the last 30 days I've dealt with some of the toughest shit I've ever had to.  I found out after twenty-one years that my father died not of a heart attack, but of an opiate overdose. The same drug of choice.  I lived clean through my daughter's first birthday.

"Tonight I had a legitimate, honest, good night of fun with some friends and it didnt involve amphetamines.
A buddy I met at university invited me over for a night of poker at his place. I spent 4 or 5 hours just hanging out and playing poker with a group of guys, and for the first time in years I legitimately had a good time without Adderall or meth. I'm so happy right now, because I realized it's possible to have fun and laugh and joke around with people WITHOUT using stimulants. I thought this was impossible ever since I began taking drugs.

Just wanted to share that with everyone. I hope everyone who is struggling right now can find the same hope and happiness that I found tonight.",4

"FIVE FUCKING MONTHS! Clean and sober of all drugs...
I have just officially managed five months free of all drugs. No Meth, No Ket, No Xanax, No Alcohol, No Cigarettes...I even drink decaf.  
  
Slowly the feeling of ""I would cut both my legs off for a gram of Tina and a good methbong"" is starting to dissipate from my daily life.  
  
I really want to get a tattoo when I (hopefully) reach six months. It'd be my first tattoo and I would ideally like to add to it in some way when/if I make it to 1 year, 5 years etc. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I'd love to hear them :)  
  
To everyone out there who doesn't think they can make it, then just know I NEVER thought I would make it a week clean let alone five months...just keep going!  
  
**EDIT/UPDATE:   
I just want to say a big thanks to everyone who has congratulated me. It's been so difficult. About six months ago, I was a meth addict living on the streets. I NEVER thought I would get out from that vicious circle and that my life was over and now I'm repairing my life and all your encouragement just spurs me on even more so thank you!** ",3

I don't put much stock in keeping track of time - all we have is a daily reprieve, after all - but it dawned on me a few minutes ago that Tuesday, December 10th, marks the 11th anniversary of my last drink.  I was a 24 year-old Peace Corps volunteer in Central Asia when... well, what happened?  I don't think it's right to say that I decided to stop drinking, because I don't believe that I had the power to make that decision, not then.  More like, I stopped trying to persuade myself that drinking wasn't a problem for me.

Anyway, if anybody out there reading this is wavering, let me just say: it can be done, and it's worth it.

"My first NA meeting!
Last night, I was on the way to my first NA meeting when I looked at the meeting schedule--for the first time, I noticed it said ""step study."" I thought, ""Shit, that sounds boring. This is the wrong meeting. I'm going home."" Then I thought, *""Aha!* You're trying to talk yourself out of it!"" It nearly worked. I kept driving.

I pulled up in front of the church, and when I reached the side door a woman came up and gave me a big smile. ""You here for the meeting? NA? *I'm Hope,""* she said.

*Pfft!* You've *got* to be kidding me. ""I'm Hope!"" She was beaming. I was already glad I was there. She wasn't fake but truly warm in a kind of wacky and endearing way.

Inside, the guy who was chairing the meeting--a biker, with long grey hair and a white beard--asked if he could sit next to me. ""Your first meeting!"" he said. ""I want to be next to you. So, you're using?""

The meeting was interesting. I've been to my share of AA meetings, but this was different. These people were *partiers.* They laughed, cracked jokes, made fun of each other, made fun of themselves, and didn't talk much about god or prayer. They were not the least bit pious. There was serious talk, but this was a *party* thrown by people who know how to party.

I just listened. At the end, they gave me a one-day chip and as I got up, the room erupted in hoots and applause. Then a few of them pressed their phone numbers into my hand. 

The truth is, I was planning on getting high after the meeting. I didn't. I got high *on* the meeting, and on the people. (D'aww! How sappy!)

I'm planning on going back tomorrow. 

I'm one of them.

"10 years clean and sober... where the heck did my decade go?
So, I got sober at the tender (and illegal in the US) age of 19 WAAAAY back on May 5th, 2004.  I took a medical leave of absence from college, went to rehab (and then a second rehab without ever relapsing, they just thought I needed that much more help).  After a year of working and going to meetings and taking classes at a local community college, I went back to the school I'd been at.  I graduated in two years (and got great grades when I wasn't acting like I was going for a double major in partying and alcohol tolerance).  After that I applied for a foreign teaching gig, and moved to Japan to be an English teacher for three years at the high school and junior high school level.  Japan was difficult because I wasn't fluent in Japanese so while I could recount the events of my life, I lacked the grammar and vocabulary to talk about my feelings.  While in Japan, I took up a bunch of new hobbies, worked the steps, etc. etc.  I then applied for graduate school and got accepted, and even got some money to help pay for it!  

Now I am just about to finish my fourth year in graduate school, and I look back and cannot believe how far I've come and how much I have changed.  I am amazingly happy, and though I get agitated sometimes, I don't ever get angry.  I nearly always make amends, even if I think that the other person acted worse that I did.  I don't have cravings.  I actively try to help people.  My relationships with my family members, once ruined, are all really really good.  People tell me that I am good person (though not a nice person...), and I find that I am now surrounded with people that like me for me, without agendas.

I'm going to keep coming back, and I hope to you all there too!",3

I care about things again. My girlfriend likes being around me again. I started skateboarding again. i wont lie, I miss the security of Xanax and other drugs. but it feels good to know that when i mess up, it isn't because i was high. i feel really lucky. every day I don't use gives me a feeling of accomplishment.

"I'm finally starting to feel like I'm not missing out on anything by staying sober.
I've lost all my fair weather friends by abstaining. People I used to know come up to me looking for my old self and I turn them down. No I won't go grab a drink, no I won't go to some shady motherfucker's house to get high. I let it be known I'm out of that scene. It still hurts to watch them walk away or for me to leave knowing I don't really have a place to go but home. 

Every time I got drunk I would come out of a blackout using stimulants or wake up days later with hundreds of dollars missing and the telltale signs of opiate use around me. Cops started to be involved more often than not. I had moved towns to get away from myself but less than three months later I was on their radar as a known user. 

Tonight I wanted to drink, fuck, smoke, anything. I drank tea instead. Used music to manipulate my mood. For the first time I finally thought to myself 'I'm glad I didn't drink tonight.' My neighbour had come home and passed out, leaving his door open and his dog loose. I could see the guy from the doorway but he didn't respond so I left a bowl of water and put the dog back inside.

There's a busy highway not 300 yards from here. If I had been fucked up I wouldn't've been able to help. So here's to three months sobriety. I'm still lonely, still anxious all the time, still paying debts I hardly remember incurring. Still going to jail. Still might lose my home. Still living off potatoes. But I saved a dog tonight. ",4
"4 Years Sober Today...
Hey guys, it is my sober birthday, and today I have 4 years in recovery. I took my last drink on July 4th 2010, after several failed attempts to stop drinking and using. It feels like a million years ago. To think it was just 4 short years ago is scary, but also feels good. 

Back then, I never thought I would be able to live, happily, sober. But I also never really knew what it meant to be happy. In 4 years I got a new job, I got married, moved across the country, and started to feel alive. If I hadn't buckled down and gone to meetings and built my support system, I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, I would be dead today. I wasn't going to make it. I was suicidal, I was alone, I drove drunk and high everyday. I had a death wish. I was a janitor in my old high school, drinking in the closets and puking in sinks. At 28 years old I was still hanging out in my old high school (granted I was working) doing a lot of the same stuff I was doing when I was a student there. It was sad. 

Now I wake up everyday, sometimes groggy, sometimes cranky, but never hung over. I still get caught up in some of the small things; complain about my job, wish I was richer, better, younger, whatever. But most of the time I am able to take a minute and step back, and really put it into perspective. I'm happy now. My life isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but it's manageable. Everyday is a new day. And I think that's the most important thing I was able to learn. 

Thanks for letting me share my scatter brained pat on the back.

Usually I don't make my anniversaries a big deal, since the first year left me truly grateful and was so overwhelming that I know I'm taken care of by a higher power, and that it's a day at a time. But I figure it's for other people we celebrate and give testimony to recovery. 

I'm kind of tripping out because it hurts my head, it doesn't make sense. I went to a detox to speak today and shit a week or two I could understand coming into the program. It seems every time I go there was someone in detox who had a lot of time and now is sweating out their drug of choice in shoes without laces in detox. People with time have been going out, going to prison, dying lately all in my circle.

"Reddit, I had a pretty boot-shaking experience yesterday. Feedback is appreciated!
Hey y'all, I'm a 22 year old and I've been sober for 5 months and 9 days. Yesterday, after I got off of work, I went to get a smoothie. As I'm waiting in line to pay, I start curiously digging through my wallet. This particular wallet has traveled with me to rehab, several AA meetings, to my job, and all around town-along with all of its contents. As I'm rummaging through it, I see a $2 bill that's folded up kind of odd. I open it, and low and behold, a line of adderall is inside. My first instinct was to lick it. Somehow, almost like on auto-pilot, I emptied the contents on the ground, and then gave the $2 bill as a tip to the drive-thru lady. I just wanted to share my experience with y'all, and maybe get some feedback. Thanks guys!",3

"8 years ago today i hit my rock bottom. Literally.
On September 9th, 2004, i was at the end of my rope. I was using and drinking constantly, i wasn't going back to college, i had lost most of my friends because of my addiction and self centeredness, and i decided to kill myself. I had attempted many times before (that was why i had been kicked out of college, for drinking in the dorms and trying to kill myself often). 

That day (technically sept 8th) i had been drinking and using all day. I got into a fight with the boy i was ""seeing"" (read: sleeping with) because he was going to stay with his girlfriend, because as he said ""why would i date you?! You're crazy!"" I got into a fight with my parents because i was drinking, and i told them i knew theyd be happier if i wasnt in their lives. So i went up to my bedroom on the 3rd floor, looked out my window and thought, ""ok. Either go to bed and be a pussy, or jump out this window and hopefully you die.""

I didn't die. (obviously.) But i did break my back. And as I lay in the grass, looking up at the sky, bawling, i said ""God just do SOMETHING with me! I cant even kill myself, im such a failure!!"" i got up, walked into my house, fought with my parents more, then passed out. When i woke up, i was throwing up blood, so they took me to the hospital, where the xrays showed i had burst a vertebrae. I had to have invasive surgery where they put rods in my spine and took bone marrow from my hip. I had to learn how to walk again, and it was in the hospital that i told my mom i needed help. I told her if i drank or used again, i would in fact kill myself and i needed rehab.

In the past 8 years, ive done rehab, halfway house, sober house, undergrad college (degree in music therapy), graduate school (masters in addiction counseling), and am now working at a treatment center for adolescents. I call my sponsor and my parents often, i go to meetings, and i work the steps. I have sponsees of my own, and i have really amazing friends who have never seen me use.

The things i've gotten from this program are intangible. I am at peace. I dont regret my past, nor wish to shut the door on it. Every day i'm filled with gratitude and acceptance of who i am and how the world around me is. I have my moments of self-loathing (progress not perfection haha) but i have the ability now to speak up and ask for help. I live by principles not personalities.

I never thought i would live to be 27, ad i NEVER thought i could live such a fun and amazing life sober, but it's possible.

I just want to thank you guys for being here, and sorry for my rambling. I always get sentimental/reflective on my rebirthday :)

tl;dr- i got sober 8 years ago.",3
"Nose surgery recovery milestone
So I completely ruined my nose with coke. I was supposed to have surgery to repair it almost exactly three years ago, but bailed on the appointment because I knew I'd just shove drugs up it while it was healing and make it worse. 

Just wanted to share my positive milestone... I received reconstructive septoplasty surgery yesterday and will be two years clean (of all drugs and alcohol) in November. I'm so proud of myself for getting to the point in recovery where I can really start to clean up the mess I made of my life. I'm so excited to breathe out of my nose again, not have nosebleeds every time I exert myself (has been really standing in the way of exercise, which is great for my mental health. It also bled when I laughed, cried, vomited (a rarity, now!), And (extremely shittily) when I orgasmed). Also my migraines and sleep should improve greatly once I am healed. 

I am in a great deal more pain than I expected post-surgery but it's worth it to be able to experience everything I've been avoiding because of my nose. Taking my life back from addiction and alcoholism has been the hardest and most worthwhile thing I have ever done, and to feel like I have ""earned"" this surgery is a big step for me, and I am learning to pat myself on the back when I deserve it.  

I'm just really proud of where I am at and wanted to share with you all. Thanks for your strength, community. You always have inspired me to not give up, to keep fighting, and this is a major milestone for me. 

Love to you all. Thanks for being here. ",3
"I ran into my dealer today.
I've been clean for about a week from stimulants. I had the same dealer for the past few years and we both go to university together, so I know the guy pretty well. I used to text him daily looking to pick up and I haven't been replying to him all week. I was walking to class this morning and he saw me and came up to me. Started off pretending like he cared about how I was doing and whatever. I kept trying to hint that I wasn't interested, and eventually he flat out made me an offer. He said he ""missed seeing me"" and that he would give me a crazy deal on his latest gear.

I stopped, looked him dead in the eyes, and said ""if I ever see you or hear from you again, I will hold you down and slam your head into the ground until you stop breathing. Now get the fuck away from me.""

Now Im 6'6, 250 pounds, and he is some scrawny little twerp. The look of fear and embarrassment on his face was priceless. I felt so strong and confident watching him go from confusion, to anger, to fear, and then walking away. 

God, what a rush. I'm so proud of myself for burning that bridge, and just wanted to share it with you all. I was probably a bit too harsh, and it's not his fault that I came to him for drugs, but I was so angry and frustrated just being in his presence and knowing that I could throw everything away in the next 15 minutes if I just said yes. I also feel bad that there were a few other people around who witnessed it, but I just don't care. I'm proud of myself for saying no.

This has been a damn long week, and I'm so tired and drained and scared. But I'm just taking it day by day. Thanks for reading all of my posts here and giving me encouragement, everyone. You have helped me so much just by sharing your experiences and encouragement. Love yall <3",4

"My Tattoo
About 20 years ago, a good friend of mine stabbed me with a pencil. I was reaching for something on his desk and he went to swat my hand away, not realizing he was holding a pencil. The tip snapped off in my finger, I had to go to the hospital to get it removed. My friend was absolutely sick over it — even at that age, he always had a real soft heart. When I got it removed the doctor told me “you’ll be the first of your friends to have a tattoo.”

I lost touch with the guy over the years as our lives unfolded, but I’ve always had this mark to remember him by. A few years ago, I was at a meeting in Jersey City and I swear it, there he was! I wasn’t a hundred percent sure, so I quietly tried to stare at him and make the confirmation.

A few minutes later, after I’d shared, he made the connection. His face lit up with disbelief. He raised his hand with an inquisitive look and pointed at his finger, as if to say “really? that you man?” I raised graphite marked finger and his face beamed.

After the meeting, we hugged and caught up. He’d been through the wringer with addiction — we both had. But we were both doing better, putting the pieces back together, so much more grateful for what we had on that day, because we knew neither of us deserved it. Since, we’ve run into each other quite a bit. We ran in the same circles, and it was a good place to be.

He died on Oct. 11. This fucking disease got him. A week ago he was posting goofy pictures on Facebook from work, because he had a good job now. There are pictures scattered across his recent history with friends, with his daughter, his girlfriend and his family. He got all of that back. In reality, he deserved all of it, because he worked to get it back. And now he’s gone.

20 years ago I became the first kid in my school to get a tattoo. For two decades it meant little to me, now it might be the most significant tattoo I have. Now, it reminds me that all I have is today, and if I let my guard down or think “I’ve got this” for one damn second, it could all be gone. I’ll miss you buddy, but thank you.",0
"Just found out sponsee od'ed and died
I had only worked with her for a short while and due to various circumstances we had just met once or twice and talked on the phone a few times. Mostly I am shocked and sad. She was young, early twenties. I hadn't heard from her in about two weeks and suspected that she had gone out again. Went on Facebook to try and track her down and that was when I saw the news in comments on her profile. I do know that she had struggled with feeling like she could have one last hurrah before committing to sobriety, which had led to multiple relapses over the past year before I met her. What I don't know is why some of us get this and others don't, and while I usually can sit with the uncertainty of not knowing that, tonight it's a little harder to accept.

"18 years of saving my life, 1 day at a time.
18 years ago today I walked into a room of recovery. There was a man sitting at a table, doing some paper work. I told him why I was there and he proceeded to to share with me his experience with alcohol. He gave me a list of 20 questions and told me to answer them to myself....said he did not need to know what my answers were. After glancing over them, it looked like I was in the right place.
I have not had a drink of alcohol from that day. What I have done is participated in a set system of directions that has helped me to form a new way of thinking...I changed my mind about some things. When I was able to change my mind, I became able to change my behaviors......imagine that.
There are to many people to thank. Many more have now passed away. Many are just lost to time and distance. No matter where they are, I will tell you that I did not recover from a trashed out liver and a hopeless state of mind without them. 
I humbly asked God to remove my obsession for alcohol. I tell you that God answered that prayer. I am a walking miracle. I also tell you that he used recovering drunks and drug addicts as the tools to save me. He even used some that had to die to get clean. 

This post is dedicated to those who have carried me until I could walk, and then helped me to trudge the path of happy destiny. For you I am grateful.

It works, if you work it.

I did it one day at a time, and you can too.  It's very simple: I just don't pick up ***the first one***, just for today, ***no matter what***, and do whatever else I need to do to let that happen.  That's really all there is to it.

Thank you for my sobriety.",

"6 months today!
I finally reached the half-year mark. Haven't been sober for that long ever since I began using. The intriguing part of this is that I had an extremely vivid using dream this morning. In it, I had relapsed right before reaching my 6 month mark and chose to keep it a secret even from my sponsor and even picked up the chip knowing I didn't deserve it. I continued working the program but kept using occasionally until i returned to my full blown addict lifestyle while still keeping the whole thing under wraps, afraid of what would happen if others had found it I was a sham. It was so realistic that I woke up terrified, thinking I had legitimately relapsed only to realize that it was all just a dream after a good 15 seconds. Then it came to me that today's my 180th day clean and I felt rejuvenated. Can't help but think that there was some sort of significance to that dream, some sort of message from my Higher Power that I can't comprehend very well. Anyways, feeling quite glad despite the scariness I experienced this morning and excited to pick up that chip, knowing I deserved it. Thanks for reading.",

"One Year!!!
One year clean on nov 14. I wake up so happy every day to begin a new day. I’m constantly smiling at work and outside work. This feels really really good to be clean. My first time clean since 07.  Cleaning up the wreckage of my past is getting easier and easier and most importantly it’s getting done. Pink cloud or not, I feel so happy. The fellowship is my way of life now. 

On the flip coin, my life is still unmanageable. I want to sleep very little so I get more time to do all the things I want to do. I account for every hour of the day. I can never watch an TV. I have an inherent fear of going back to active addiction. I hit the gym 6 days a week and I obsess about missing one day.  I get up during the night, just like I’m doing right this minutes and look at the time and if it’s not 5 am already I get so dissapointed. I do attend at least 4 meetings a week.

That’s where I’m at. ",
"Today is my 60 Days
It feels as though its already been a year LOL!  Probably the biggest blessing for me is that I no longer have to wake up with a dirty conscience.  I'm no longer living a double life.  When I was using I would wake up in the morning sick and disgusted with myself.  Knowing that I'm doing the best with what I can and not using gives me a strong sense of freedom unlike any other.  I'm still facing consequences of my using/drinking but I know that this takes time.  Things don't happen over night but I know that this is the only way for me.  I wish all of you the best of luck in your recovery!  Stay strong and don't use no matter what!",

"I have 28 years sober today. Got sober at 17. Relapsed at one year and learned to be more careful. Ask me anything!
I got sober as a teenager. Went through senior year, senior trip (oops that's when I relapsed), college, sorority rush, graduate school, getting married, having children, watching my SO relapse, getting divorced, starting a business plus lots of other things, sober.  

I believe in having a good time and I think that is the key to sobriety (beyond the steps, etc).",
"Celebrating 5 years today
I have 5 years sober today from drugs and alcohol, and I just felt like sharing with you guys. Last time I used, I overdosed and wound up in the ER. When I regained consciousness, the doctor told me that if I would have arrived to the hospital 3 minutes later, I wouldn't be alive. At 22 years old, that was a bottom for me. 
I went into an outpatient rehab program that eventually got me plugged into AA. Since then, I went back to school and finished my degree, found a steady job, met the girl, and got engaged. My life is completely different now than when I was drinking and using. I'm very grateful to be here and to be sober. I have responsibilities in places I didn't even know existed. People can depend on me. My family can rely on me. 
I just want to say that if you're new, keep coming back. Things do materialize if we work for them. I hope everyone has a safe and sober 2016! May the blessings be. ",
"3 years sober today
Today I have 3 years sober. 3 years ago I was drinking alone watching a movie (Unguarded - Chris Herren Story) which changed my life. In that movie a man was living selfishly through drugs, alcohol, women, etc. At one point he was passed out with homeless men, I said (to the TV), “That’s pathetic”, then I paused and said “Oh wait, that’s you Justin”. A feeling of disgrace came through my body at 2am, I cried from shame, but then a feeling of relief and joy because I told myself “You don’t have to live like that anymore”. I haven’t had a drink since.
From that day, I decided to become the man I admire. It’s been hard work, very hard, but the old me had to die for the new one to live. Some of you know my journey and I’ll tell you from day 1 in sobriety it has been therapy (to fix the issues that caused the drinking), being around other sober and positive folk (people, places, things), volunteering (my humility led me to give back), mentoring (giving one on one yields the best gratitude). From the 1st day I created my own rules and I do not negotiate the integrity of that ethos. I don’t go to bars, because I don’t belong there...it's simply not interesting to me.
3 years later what do I have? An amazing wife (before I was incapable of love or being loved), 2 amazing twin daughters (I can give them the love I never received growing up). My financial status is great (before I was borrowing money to support my habits)- I’m now closing on a new beautiful house next month for my family (when I was drinking I sometimes lived in a garage). Also in 3 years, I’ve learned a language, become a published author, been syndicated as a writer, dedicated myself to boxing, over 300 volunteer/mentoring efforts, and most importantly held my head high and proud of the man I see in the mirror (my drinking helped with self-worth, social anxiety, and many things that related to me not accepting me - that's because I didn't like who I was).
If you felt humility through this thread, that’s’ because it’s there, and I feel it every day. I changed my behavior that changed my life. The life I have now is way better than the life I had before, therefore my old ways are simply not interesting to me at all…and I think that is the secret to change/recovery…create a better life than the one you had. My life is simple, I do only a few things, but I do those things exceptionally. Some might believe addiction is a disease, but I believe the mind is powerful enough to re-wire and learn new behaviors if one is willing to put in the work - this is because I believe in the essence of the human spirit and our capacity to be amazing people. You are amazing, did you know that? If not, read this thread again. The chill you feel in your body is your potential..follow that, it's honest, it will guide you correctly.
Share this with anyone who might feel inspired to become their better self. Today is my “re-birth day” I'm not perfect, but i'm perfect for the people I'm meant for...and they love that I'm recovered....one day at a time.

i spent some time with my friend who had been sober a month or two before me but relapsed last month and has been struggling since. tonight he called me. said he used today. agreed to meet him for coffee. on the phone he said he was considering going to a long term treatment. 

we get to talking and all i hear are the reasons why he cant go, 'what he'll lose' and all of this stuff. it's easy to sympathize with but i had to remember, this is the disease talking. this is the disease trying to keep this guy right where he is, trying to keep him stuck from taking action. trying to keep him in his thoughts to figure this thing out. 

we hear so many slogans and cute little catch phrases and over time i learn what they truly mean.

the disease talks to us and to others in our own voice. it tells us all the sound logical reasons why we cant. it tells us how we're going to figure this out and be ok. it tells us that goddamn lie that we can still go on doing what we've been doing.

The journey has been hell before and after getting clean. Full-time academics while working full-time (and part-time for 18 months) while having a family etc... wore me down in the long run. I also went through some rough times as I migrated away from 12-Step activity after about 3-4 years clean for many personal reasons.

I'll share a little of my experience in recovery.

Some people see the light and other people feel the heat. I felt the heat. I started going to NA meetings not because ""I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired,"" but to get a piece of paper signed.

""The miracle"" or ""spiritual awakening"" they talk about I always thought would be some burning bush epiphany. In fact it's more like a tree growing. At some time a seed gets planted and with enough water, it slowly grows. I can't point to the day on the calendar when I became honest or when I decided to work steps. I look back and the change was slow. That's why it's so important for me to keep coming back.

For a while, I was getting the probation slip signed and leaving after the meeting but what people were saying had an impact on me. Then a group I was regularly attending held a home group camp-out/float trip. I went on the trip and was amazed. It was the first time being clean that I had fun and made friends. That trip was the catalyst for my personal program of recovery. I was going to meetings for myself and because I had friends there and was comfortable.

I got a sponsor who is really big into unity. We'll go to meeting in East Bumfuck and he knows multiple people there. They guy's base and network is huge. The relationship I have with my sponsor today was created with a foundation of honesty. I share everything with my sponsor and my sponsor has given me more guidance in my life than anyone ever has. I have started working steps and the program has changed my life.

Home group, fellowship, sponsorship, and steps. Those are the tools of my program and I only get so far not utilizing them ALL.

"Well, I made it to my first AA meeting. It went much better than expected.
If you look at my posting history I'm the guy that has been having withdrawal seizures and am currently trying to get into detox. I took the advice here and went to my first AA meeting. 

I'm still feeling overwhelmed by the amount of support that I got there. There were roughly 40 people and I was the only new one so I stuck out like a sour thumb.

During a break and at the end the regulars were gravitating to me with a ton of advice and well wishes. One women bought me a copy of The Big Book out of pocket and I got contact info from others. ""Do you need a ride to detox tomorrow? Call me. Do you need someone to talk to? Call me. Can you not afford a drink until you get medical treatment? Call me.""

The best part for me was the amount of non-believers. I got lucky as the meeting that I chose has a reputation for being atheist. This was the biggest excuse that I used in the past for not attending meetings.

Anyways, it was fucking amazing and I will be returning. Thank you all for giving me the push that I needed.

The whole reason i started doing drugs was for pain management. i have real bad migraines and back pain. I went to the doctor today to see what i could do about it.

He slammed the file he was reading down on the desk and starts yelling about how he's tired of ""all drug addicts trying to cheat the system"". Myself and the nurse are sitting there just dumbfounded. 


After he's done yelling, i just quietly pull out a paper from my purse and explain to him that i'm not asking for pills, i just needed him to sign a referral for me to start physical therapy. 

The nurse abruptly leaves for 10 minutes and comes back with my actual doctor who pulls the intern outside. And all hell erupts  on the other side of the door, he's yelling about how the nurse told him how disrespectful he was.

"After 15 years of constant drug use, I am going back to school to become a counselor
Hello All!

A little backstory really quick. I started drinking and doing coke when my dad died in front of me from a fatal heart attack on the 4th of july. Never had proper time to grieve. Dropped out of school, ruined potential scholarships. Did pretty well working, but addiction kept getting worse. Got a great job as an independent insurance broker then ended up becoming a medicare broker trainer for a major insurance company. Made super good money, became familiar with pills. Blew all my money. Lost job. Homeless, Stole from friends and family. Lost everyone and everything. Finally fed up and did not want to die. Checked self into rehab. While in rehab friends and family pressed charges for stuff I did. Turned self in after completing rehab. Spent 6 months in county jail. Finally got GED in jail (did not even need to study, and IDK why I never did, just afraid of failure I guess). Dodged 5 years in DOC. Now I made the decision to follow a dream apparently years in the making. I start school the 2nd week in March. Bachelor of Science in Counseling with an Emphasis in Addiction, Chemical Dependency, and Substance Abuse. Friends and family are all coming back into my life. Super proud of me. Everyday I hear from someone that they knew I had something special inside of me and how happy they are that I am finally at peace.

I am super excited because I genuinely want to help more people at a different level than I am now. I am currently a Peer Support Specialist for the same halfway house that helped me after treatment. But I want to get deeper into helping others lives. I want to help them and their families.

If anyone can learn anything from my story is that it IS POSSIBLE to come back from the depths of despair. The main reason I became Peer Support is because I felt that I threw my whole life away and became a loser and would never amount to anything ever again. One person helped me see that my life was not over, I just needed to want to build that ladder to pull myself out of the hole I dug myself into. He really helped save me and I will forever be grateful.

TLDR: addiction helped me lose everything; Now going to school to be a counselor to help other addicts find their peace.

"[Feeler]- Looking to start a young peoples AA/NA recovery subreddit
I did a search on reddit, expecting to find a young peoples AA group exploding with people...but I couldn't find anything.

So I had the idea of starting a young peoples recovery subreddit for us to have general discussion, and new young people that want some information on how recovery works, mainly AA and NA based.

I'm a 26 yr old male, been in recovery for years now. My friends and I just started a local young peoples meeting with fellowship in our biggest nearby city. Within the first meeting we had around 35+ people! We were really not expecting that! It was the first young peoples meeting in that city, and we go out each night of the meeting and have planned activities. We get to have fun and experience recovery at the same time.

I want to try and bring that to reddit. Us young folk are on computers and cell phones all the time. I was fortunate enough to get into several rehabs and sober houses, but lots of new guys/gals don't have the resources around them to get an accurate view of recovery and AA/NA, so I would like to be able to bring that to them.

Still building up karma to start the subreddit, and I still want to do planning before I open it. If you are interested in helping set up this subreddit, please PM me so we can talk about it. I can provide my cell phone, email, and what not. I would like the subreddit to be a wealth of helpful discussion and information**

I hear it said often in meetings, but if I could have written down what I wanted my life to look like at 3 years clean when I first came around, I would have been selling myself way short. I'm so blessed to have been given the opportunity to recover from addiction and to find a new way to live through working the steps of narcotics anonymous. I am so grateful that our predecessors have shown me how to suit up and show up, and they loved me until I could love myself. In the Living Clean book it says, ""what we find is not that our higher power spares us the hardships of life, but that it gives us the grace to walk through them clean.""

Welp. HERE IT IS! The day I have been dreading since the day I put the plug in the jug and took the pipe out of my mouth! 3 years and 9 months have lead to tomorrow. 

It has always been a big ""Problem"" for me in recovery And I am realizing now, that it will just be another 24 hours.

When I got sober at age 17 I considered my life to be over and that there was no hope of ever living a normal life. Yet, this year I purchased gifts for everyone in my family. Most ""Normal People"" do that, right? I hold an amazing job and show up ever day. Normal? I am working on Christmas Day. A lot of normality here! For me it is so out of the Norm and it feels so good to be living in the LIGHT. 

I always dreaded my 21st birthday wondering ""What am I supposed to do?"" ""I have to drink!"" But today I don't want that. I am gonna do what I want to do! My first sponsor always told me that I have the world by the balls and I can make what I want with it. So, I will be attending an Improv Show in Boston with my family because that is where I want to be...with my family that loves me no matter what. After the show it will be dinner and Coca-Cola's on the rocks. And then it is off to NECYPAA in Rhode Island to see old friends and meet some new ones. Now that is a 21st Birthday!

If you are struggling with alcohol or drugs and feel alone today just know that I am here with you. Love.

"You know what's more important than cakeday?
Today I celebrate one year sober thanks to the program of AA and figuring out how to tap into a Higher Power that works for me.  Through that year I've dealt with the suicide of a close friend, the dissolution of a marriage of 16 years, the sale of a house, and setting up a whole new life and lifestyle.  I am 44 now and used alcohol and drugs since I was 16 with never more than a few days break under my own willpower.  For me the trick was attending meetings, following the steps, working with a sponsor, working with sponsees, and learning true humility and gratitude.  I loved to think I was the center of the world and the boss of everything in it.  Giving that up to follow the program of AA and the advice of my sponsor while adopting a willingness to believe in bigger things than myself have saved me from certain death, at least for another 24 hours.

"It works
Today I have been clean for 28 years. DO NOT BE IMPRESSED. 

I am a habitual fuck-up. Its my gift, my skill, my calling in life. Inthe last 28 years I have been arrested, I have been fired, I haved destroyed more relationships than I can count, I have fucked up my life and I have fucked up others lives. I did everything wrong except one thing. I didnt use.

Reflecting back, 28 years was no harder than 27 years or 26 years. You want to know whats hard? Whats hard is 90 days. 90 days is a long fucking time. I was acutely aware of every minute of those first 90 days, if not every second.

28 years just happens. It happens by doing the same shit you did to get 90 days. Don't use - just for today. The 27 years and 364 days prior to this one are history and don't mean a fucking thing if I should use today.

I didn't do this by myself. All of you who ever gave recovery a shot helped me. By helping you to stay clean, it helped me to try and stay clean. Bysharing our shame, our fears, cleaning up our messes, I showed you some shit and you showed me some shit. So thank you. Thank you for walking through all of this shit alongside of me for the last 28 years.

Lets do it one more day.",

"Celebrating 90 Days Clean & Sober Today..
It's so awesome, but it's so crazy. I'm seventeen years old, and I was using oxycodone, psychedelics, marijuana, and pretty much *anything* else I could get my hands on since I was 11-12 years old. After countless overdoses, arrests, charges, and all this other garbage, I finally decided to get clean ninety days ago after suffering an OD that I still wonder about because it's a miracle that I'm not dead. Being a full fledged heroin/oxycodone addict at sixteen years old is not cool, but I am so grateful to be clean today. (:

If anyone is familiar with NA, now that I have 90 days, I can sign the meeting list! If anyone ever needs support/help/just wants to talk, PM me and I'll be happy to help. (:",
"21 days off heroin and hopeful.
I thought this would be no fun. I thought people who didn't use were no fun (despite the fact that I was no longer having fun using, just ruining all my relationships and my life). It's actually dawning on me that I really never have to shoot up anymore. I never have to be dopesick again! Over the past few years of using I would say ""I used to be a musician"" because getting high prevented me from caring about writing music. Since I quit I have written 3 new songs. In fact, I'll post them soon!

EDIT:  Keep in mind that these are shitty recordings of super-duper rough drafts of these songs. I'll be fleshing them out over the holiday weekend in a much higher quality home recording with more than the basic chords and rhythm guitar. Still, you can get the gist of it, I think. Any feedback is appreciated!

EDIT: Looks like my GF and I are splitting up after 12 years together. Goodbye love of my life. I don't blame you, I just want you to be happy because I love you so much. I know you're better off without me. Goodbye friends, goodbye my sweet doggie, goodbye Portland. Southern Cali, looks like I'm back for good.  I will stay clean.",
"I only wanted one day sober.
Sept 3 is my son's birthday. I wanted to try to not fuck up at least one of my kid's birthdays, so on Sept. 2 I spent my first day in a long time, sober. The next day I was able to bake him a cake, get him presents, and also get to a court date completely sober and not hungover.

I only wanted one day sober, but figured I might be able to make it up to two weeks, because that seemed to be about how long I could go before I was dying for a drink. Five days after I got sober, I went to my first AA meeting that wasn't court mandated (had been sentenced to two a week), and heard someone share something that snapped me awake. I never intended to stay sober for very long. If I had, the last thing I drank would definitely not have been 2 bottles of $2 Walmart wine. If I knew how AA was about to change my life, I probably would have built a shrine to Jack Daniels and did a proper goodbye. Instead, I decided to really give this AA thing a try, even though I knew it wasn't gonna work for me. Even though I couldn't stand the thought of a ""higher power"", and hated the word God. Even though my life was worse than yours, because if you had my life there's no way you could be sober either. 

I got a sponsor, attended a shitload of meetings, and worked the steps even though I was just going through the motions. I figured that if I gave it an honest shot, I could really say I'd tried everything, go back to drinking and tell everyone to leave me the fuck alone, because it didn't work. I worked the steps simply to prove them wrong. The only thing proven to be wrong....was me. 

Today is my AA bday. That one day I wanted has now turned into two years. I know that's hardly any time sober, but to go from where I was, to where I am now, is absolutely amazing. I am currently going through an extremely tough issue in my family. One of my children had a crime committed against them a couple of weeks ago, and I should be at the bottom of several bottles by now. However, thanks to the tools I've been given in this program, I am able to be present to help do the next right thing, even though it's one of the hardest things I've ever done. I don't have to fuck the situation up anymore by trying to kill my pain through a drink. I've had some awesome times in sobriety, but I think I especially appreciate being sober when life throws me some shitty curveballs. Just proves to me that this program truly does work.

Thank you to everyone here who shares their stories, asks for help, reminds me of where I've been, and shows me where I can get to. I never believed this program would work for me, but what I didn't know was....I didn't have to believe. I just had to do.",

Most days it's normal wear and tear. You feel good or you feel bad. Today I had drugs in hand. I was convinced I was going to relapse. I called someone and they convinced me to wait until I got home from work. I didn't use then and I haven't since I got home. I'm glad that instead of relapsing (again) I tried something different. 
I don't know how hard I'm going to make it for myself but I'm glad that today something I did (or in this case didn't do) actually made it easier. 
I'm glad there are people who remind me they love me even if I frequently don't feel it for myself. ",

After 6 months sober and being in a Drug Court program for a while, I made a poor decision to get high and i was using for about 2 weeks. Looking back on it, very dumb, but at the time did not seem like there was a way out! Had some time to sit in county jail for dirty drops and think about my decision haha.

I have nowhere else to share this but I need to share it somewhere. I’ve been clean for roughly 6 months now and I’m just extremely proud of myself. I’ve got a new job I’m happy with, I’m consistently attending NA meetings, I’ve graduated school early, and I’m even moving into my own apartment in a few weeks.  I’m genuinely happy with the friends I currently have, they help me everyday to be the best I can be. Everything is going so well for me right now It’s actually kind of scaring me.

I walked into the rooms of NA a hot mess, begging for help but having no hope that anything would actually change. After living this program to the best of my ability ever since I have witnessed everything about my life change and improve in every possible way. I know it's still a little early, and we don't cop early in NA, but I just want to scream and cheer and all that crap.

"two years clean and sober
Well aren't we a fine looking bunch eh? All of us. Yep, you too. We're reminiscing about New Years past, or New Years last night. We're either cringing at our past behaviours, congratulating ourselves on staying strong, or hoping/wishing/planning for a sober life. 

This coming Wednesday will mark two years since I had my last drink. I hadn't planned on quitting before I did - New Years Eve two years ago was a hot mess of peach schnapps and cocaine (wtf - schnapps? lol). I just kept on drinking until I blacked out real good January 5th, and found myself utterly unable to continue. I'd lost control a LONG time before that - but January 5th 2014 was when I finally admitted it. 

I won't bore you sort the story of my recovery. This post is about NYE! My first clean and sober NYE was last year. I still had the ""gotta get out and party"" mindset, so I went out partying (sober of course) and it SUCKED. As it turns out, I have no desire to party with drunk people anymore. 

So this year, I stayed in with my new fella (he's been in recovery for 5 months) and this morning, we volunteered at a homeless shelter before coming home and having steak and eggs for breakfast - no hangovers here!

Now he's napping and I'm reminiscing about NYEs past, along with all of you. 

Happy 2016, yeah? It's our year, good things are coming out way, I can feel it!",

I've been going to meetings for over 10 years and last night, for the very first time, I called someone! I have severe social anxiety and I scoot out of the meeting as soon as it's over and the idea of calling anyone, including another addict, has always been so overwhelming that I just couldn't do it. But last night I really needed someone to talk to and I guess the planets lined up just right for me because I was able to pick up the phone and make the call.

I'm seriously so stoked and proud of myself and I wanted to share this victory.

"The story of how my brother died today.
First please excuse any grammatical or spelling errors, I am still emotionally shaken to my very core.

I woke up this morning 9/5 and it was just like any other day. I recently moved back in with my parents, it’s been about 2 weeks now. I groggily rolled out of bed and went down stairs to grab myself something to drink. My mother was up already, bouncing around the house with more energy than I will ever be able to muster at 7 am. I asked her if she was coming into work today, to which she replied “yes as soon as I wake up your brother”. He was sleeping on the top floor of our 3 story home. I went outside for a cigarette and came back in to hear her slamming on the door to my brothers room trying to wake him up. I yelled up and asked her what was going on. She said she had been trying to wake him by slamming on the locked door for about 10 minutes. I said he is probably just still asleep, but I suppose her motherly instinct could tell there was something wrong. I brushed it off and said he is fine, he will get up soon. I went into the bathroom and a moment later I heard the most blood curdling scream I have ever heard. It almost seemed like it was coming from somewhere else. She was hysterical, repeatedly screaming “CALL 911!!” I ran halfway down the stairs and realized my cell phone was still in my pocket. I pulled it out and called 911 not knowing what to say. But somehow I just knew what was wrong, deep down in my heart, I just knew the worst had happened. I gave the operator my name and address right away and was then asked what the emergency was. I said “I think my brother is dead”, the operator needed me to confirm the situation but the door to the bedroom was still locked somehow. Apparently my mother had climbed up to the third floor bedroom through a loft from the master bedroom. I begged and pleaded with her to unlock the door but all she could was scream “Wake up! Please wake up!’ I proceeded to smash that fucking door down like it was made of matchsticks. Nothing was going to keep me out. I fell through the threshold and saw what I know will haunt me for the rest of my life. There he was, my mother cradling him rocking back and forth on the floor yelling in a mix of Korean and English. His face was swollen and blue, in his boxers and a t-shirt, there was an odor of fecal matter in the air. He looked like a poorly made mannequin of himself. I could tell right then that he was gone. But I was going to fucking resuscitate him if it was the last thing I ever do. I told the 911 operator he was blue, not breathing and unresponsive. She told me to start doing chest compression, which I did. I have never had any formal CPR training but I knew that you had to push pretty hard and possibly break the chest plate iirc. I started pounding on his chest with all my might, at which point some blood began to come out of his mouth. I mistook this for him spitting up blood so I said told her I think he is breathing! She told me to roll him on his side and clear his airways (mouth and nose) which I did. My mother was hitting him on the back beseeching him to take a breath. But nothing happened again after that. Living literally a quarter mile from a fire department the EMT’s were coming up the stairs just as this was happening. They came up and took me and my mother out of the room. I foolishly thought that maybe he was going to be okay. I prayed for the first time in my life, wishing that everything would be alright, that I could just wake up from this nightmare. It’s funny how I've been an “atheist” my entire life until I selfishly need a “god” to help me. Sadly my prayers weren't answered, which pretty much reaffirmed my lack of belief. After what seemed like an eternity the paramedics came down stairs, before he could say anything I meekly and softly said “he is gone isn’t he.” I knew that he had been dead the entire time but I just could not accept it yet, not until I had a professional tell me. The paramedic looked down and nodded his head, this is where I totally lost control of myself. I dropped onto my knees and started screaming his name, embracing my mother in my arms, uncontrollable tears, and sheer sense of terror, a loss of reality. He was gone….
My brother had just come out of rehab after kicking heroin. He was clean for about 4 and a half months. He had shot up sometime that night and overdosed. I loved him with all my heart, everything seemed to be going so well for him these past few months, however, over the past few days there were warning signs, he was getting out of work then disappearing until 1 or 2 in the morning and not wanting to say where he had been. I wish with all of my being that I had intervened when I noticed this happening. I am a recovering addict myself and I thought I knew how to appropriately deal with the warning signs of a relapse. But I failed to act, I failed to save my little brother…
 Now I am left with a myriad of emotion and no one to say anything to. I never want anyone to experience what I have today. I don’t care if this reaches everyone, but if just one person would listen to my advice then I am satisfied. Please please please don’t ignore a sign of someone who could potentially need your help. You might just save someone by pulling them aside and having a simple conversation with them. To anyone who is in recovery be strong for yourself and for the people who love you. You are worth it, more that you will ever know.

TL:DR – I found my brother overdosed this morning and I feel like it is my fault because I ignored the warning signs. If you ever see someone acting differently than they normally do, just try and talk to them about it. You might be able to save someone, maybe a simple conversation can change everything.
Edit- I am 28 and my brother was 27.

"Three years sober (and my rules for serenity).
I'll officially be three years sober tomorrow. I did it with the 12 steps as suggested in the Big Book of AA, my sponsor, my home group, and groups around the country when I travel.

I'm most grateful that my Son is fully in my life and has not seen me take a drink in three years. I'm also grateful that I have begun to live my life with vigorous honesty; to be the best me I can be. 

I'm far from perfect. My ugly defects and insecurities come to the surface often, but over time I've trained myself - among other things - to keep a running list of my rules for serenity. I don't want to come across as preachy. These particular rules apply to *ME*, and me alone. They are personal reminders and stolen sayings I've collected and keep handy whenever I get restless, irritable, and discontented. I add to it whenever a profound thought resonates with me.

I'm posting these in case they might help with someone else out there that still suffers - even if it's only one person (and PM me if you want). In no particular order...

* When you see something or someone being hurtful, cruel, ugly, vain, conceited don't react to it. Walk away from it and look for God.

* Let fear go.

* When in conflict with another, address the issue not the individual

* When you are coasting you are heading downhill, do something that requires effort.

* You have turned your life (body) and your will (thinking) over to the care of God as you understand him. So relax!

* Be here now.

* Always be teachable.

* Steps 6 and 7 are to be repeated often and whenever necessary.

* Love yourself!

... And if you have an adage that helps you in time of need, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks for reading.

"Two years today.
Two years ago I was an entry level employee for my organization, and I had embarrassed them, gotten sent home early from a work trip and was thinking I'd be fired.  I went to AA, worked the program and now--two years later--I'm one of the directors of the organization, and I'm addressing a major civic group on our behalf tonight.  They have me running two offices at once right now!  The Steps got me sober, helped me stay that way and most importantly kept me sane and useful as I surrendered the one tool that had solved my problems before--drugs and alcohol.

For those still struggling, or in early sobriety I gotta say that getting a sponsor, doing the steps in order, going to a meeting every day and getting involved in helping others has made all the difference.  If you do nothing else, get a sponsor and do whatever s/he says.

Thank you for all your encouragement and wisdom!  For the last 731 days I have had to do something every day to keep sober, and some days it was just leaving a few comments on r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY.  Great community here, and good luck on all your journeys!  ",

"3 years clean today. Here's a quick story about my Dad.
I shared this in an Ask Reddit thread and thought this story was as good as any to celebrate getting here. Please share anything you can relate to.

When I was 17 I got thrown out of my house because I kept drinking and using drugs. A couple years later I was allowed to move back in and after a while the same result. (This may have happened another time or two, my memory is a little fuzzy).
My oldest brother also lived there through most of his 20s, and being the self centered, finger pointing ingrate that I was I couldn't understand why he could stay and I kept getting kicked out. Probably had something to do with the fact that he wasn't a drug addict and could be trusted, but I didn't see it that way. To me, they were playing favorites and it wasn't ""fair"" to me.
My Dad and I met for dinner one night, and I asked him why. Why can he stay, why can you just throw me away? Now my Dad was the best kind of man you'd ever want to be your father, so I don't know why I expected him to throw a laundry list of my faults as a person in my face as justification for kicking me out. That's not the man he was, but I expected it none the less.
""Because I know that, no matter what, you'll be OK. You can take care of yourself.""
I was still in my active addiction when he died too young, but those words helped me when I began my recovery journey. The best part is that, as seemingly always, he was right. It took another 10 years or so, and he didn't live to see it, but today I have 3 years clean from drugs & alcohol. I've still got issues to deal with, but I can honestly say that today, no matter what, I'm OK.",
"I'm a 24 year old female, clean from heroin since June 4th of 2010, and I really fucking need a friend.
I've been hopeless submitting my frustrations to a few subreddits this evening reaching for any kind of support or conversation. Someone mentioned this subreddit.. here's hoping I'll get my internet therapy buddy.

I'm terribly exhausted and depressed, but basically I've been addicted to opiates since 13 when I got a back injury. After 10 years, and stepping up to IV drug use, I finally went to a neurosurgeon and have an appointment tomorrow to schedule surgery...

Because of becoming a drug addict so young I've been through a lot.. I was brutally anally raped and I can only type that, I've never been able to make those words audible. I've been a prostitute and a drug dealer, I'm a survivor of some of the most extreme forms of domestic violence.

I feel so very alone and so very sad today.. I can't imagine many things that make life worthwhile at the moment..

If someone put a bag in front of me, I can confidently say that it'd be all over right then and there.

UPDATE: I am here... I became too lethargic and withdrawn to continue with this. I'm reading the comments now. Thank you all very much for your concern and experience.",
"I just added another 24 hours... and that makes five years of continuous sobriety for this ""newcomer""
Congratulations to everyone who just added another day to their continuous sobriety!

Today, I'm celebrating five years clean and sober. It has been a bit longer than that since my last drink, but I don't think that is exactly the same as being sober. Also, I began today like I start every day: by re-committing myself to another 24 hours of sobriety.

Parts of the past few weeks have been intense, as my best friend is being treated for cancer. He's handling it with incredible grace and continuing to think more about others than about himself. (His 28 years of sobriety certainly helped him learn to do that.)

I'll go to one of my favorite meetings tonight and pick up a five year chip. I don't really like getting them, because it's like having a spotlight shining on me that I don't really want. But it helps people to see that AA is either the answer or at least can be a major part of the answer if they're alcoholic like me, and that it can work for them too if they put in the needed effort.

I also feel like a ""newcomer"" in AA, and I hope that never changes. Part of what works for me is remembering that sobriety is like walking down an elevated railroad track; if I keep centered and try to remain mindful about what I'm doing, I'll be fine. If I stray too far, there is a steep drop-off on either side.

And there are many more people with longer periods of sobriety than what I have. I saw a guy pick up a 33-year chip a couple of weeks ago. He was asked how he did that, and he replied, ""One day at a time.""

And a guy who I had never met before picked up an 8-month chip yesterday and he said that's how he is staying sober too.",

"10 years clean this weekend. My story.
Got inspired to write this after commenting in another thread. 

At 17 years old, I went to college. I immediately began drinking heavily and soon began experimenting with drugs. I barely made it a semester (Although, if you fail that semester, does it count?) and dropped out. I continued partying and taking drugs and doing an amazing amount of stupid shit along the way.

The worst period of my life (although I didn't see it that way at the time) was when I encountered my friends father one day when I went to pick up a supply from my dealer. I had known my friend for about 10 years at that point and I had known for a while that her father was a dealer, although I was still surprised to see him there. 

Anyway, we talked for a little bit and he told me that he'd give me a discount if I bought from him, since I was his daughters friend, and in exchange for doing him the occasional favor. 

Turned out that the ""occasional"" favor was to ""entertain"" him and his friends on weekends. We'd have benders on the weekends, where I fucked and sucked him and his friends in exchange for drugs. 

This went on for a while until he decided that I could be more profitable to him if he extended my ""favors"" to people outside of his inner circle, so that he could get better deals from his suppliers, and at bigger parties as entertainment. 

I started out as a plaything for him and his friends and eventually he began pimping me out to others and this went on for around 4 and a half years. 
His daughter had been away for school the entire time and I had avoided her every time that she went home during school breaks. 

It was her that eventually got me to get help. One day, after years of no contact between the two of us, she found my address at the time and showed up at my front door... I was living in a really bad area and sharing an apartment with a few other people, all of which were also addicts. She'd had no idea how bad things had gotten and broke down just inside of my door and convinced me to go to rehab not long after that. 

Partway through my stay, she came to visit, and I came clean about everything.... She sat there, crying, as she listened to me and when I finished, she got up and walked out. I've tried to reach out to her since then but she has never replied. 

From what I heard, she confronted her father soon after our conversation and broke off contact with him. She transferred schools farther away soon after that, moved, and hasn't had anything to do with either of us since then. I don't blame her, not in the least. If I were her, I'd have probably done the same thing. 

I just hope that she's doing well and that she knows how thankful I am that she saved my life.",

"Pothead in recovery
So I just shared this on someone else's post, but I need to write this here myself. I don't know why I'm up in my head about this right now. My sponsor says I need a chip on my shoulder or something, but I still struggle with this no matter how much step work I do.

My DOC was weed. That's it. No coke, crack, heroin, pills, not even alcohol (although I would drink if I had nothing else available). I've never broken a law worse than driving under the influence. I've never been arrested. I've never sold drugs. I've never been homeless, or broke, or any of that.

As a kid, all the way through High School, I was as straight laced as they come. I was also truly socially awkward, and was bullied like crazy. I hated my life, and wanted to be ""popular"", so I turned to alcohol and weed in college. I quickly found that weed was all I really wanted, and ditched the alcohol after a while.

At first, weed let me feel cool at parties. But for the overwhelming majority of my active addiction, I just sat at home, alone, not having any human contact, getting high. I was lonely and miserable. The few people in my life, like my parents, I pushed away to protect my getting high (they staged an intervention for me at one point). Lies and manipulation of the people around me was my way of life.

I worked throughout most of my addition, it was how I justified everything. On my 26th birthday some big shit went down, and I had a total emotional breakdown and threw away my career. I spent the next 8 months with nothing, feeling like a failure, trapped in a bubble of misery I didn't think I could get out of.

Then I went to NA. I cried, I begged for help, I didn't feel like I belonged, and everyone there loved me and picked me up and helped me to recovery. Today I have been clean 2 years, 3 months, and 24 days. I'm so blessed for that.

Yet sometimes I still feel the need to play this tape through, I still sometimes struggle with feeling like the only person in the room with a story like mine. There's no Marijuana Anonymous where I live, unfortunately. I love NA, but in early recovery I lived in an area with MA, and those meetings helped keep these thoughts at bay. 

I hate /r/leaves, everyone there seems so casual about quitting. ""Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna stop now."" Well good fucking for you, some of us didn't have that luxury.

Anyway, I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I know I belong here, and I'm never giving up my seat.",
"It's 1:57 a.m, i just woke up out of a dead sleep and poured my entire stash of h. into the toilet

"Does anyone else here just hate the way alcohol is accepted and promoted in society?
Might be a little bit of a rant here but here goes.

Been in recovery for a few months, just had a three day binge on alcohol, eff it minor setback. But I've done pretty much every other drug on the market, getting addicted to quite a few in the process and none of them have been as hard to kick. Which in my opinion is due to the social conditions that not only make drinking an accepted habit, but actually promotes it. Alcohol is as hard a drug as heroin, crack and meth in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned it's actually worse than crack. No parent in their right mind would ever dream of giving a young child a toot of crack, a dig of heroin or a line of meth. So why the fuck is it almost commonplace that you get a glass of wine with your dinner in some places? I first got drunk at 8, me and some friends stole a crate of beer from my house and got wasted. Now to us it never really seemed to be such a bad thing, my parents were drug addicts and dealers but I knew that wasn't normal. 


Everyone's parents seemed to drink alcohol though, never really thought by doing it over and over from a young age I'd end up with a worse addiction than the drug addicts that came begging at my house every night, that I'd end up completely screwed up blacking out randomly and waking up in the police cells again from being 13 plus on a regular basis. Now we had DARE at school, had all the drugs are bad m'kay bullshit and learned about how weed will kill you (lol) but they never really made such a big thing about alcohol. 

I'm struggling like hell to get through social events these days because everyone I know seems to meet up at the pub and get wasted whenever it's time for a reunion. But that's ok because it's taxed by our government. Yet where I live people beat the shit out of heroin addicts randomly when they see them because they are ''dirty scumbags'', even though the end result of addiction to either of them is just the same thing, a lot of the people who act like this are worse addicts than the heroin users. None of the people doing smack, crack or other hard drugs that I know would ever even think of using in front of their kids (Barring a few idiots) but every weekend you see masses of parents with their kids in the pub getting wrecked in front of them. What I'm trying to say is... WHY THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN ACCEPTED BY SOCIETY AS A WHOLE???

"NA meetings update
So I don't know if y'all remember me or not but about a year and a half ago I reached out and asked this sub for some information on starting up a narcotics anonymous meeting in our area. It took us awhile to get it off the ground but it's been having steady attendance, and since we've had such success not only are we opening up another meeting in the next town over, but we have managed to coordinate an H&I meeting in the county jail, this will be the first time NA has ever had a meeting inside this particular facility. I cannot thank y'all enough for the wisdom and encouragement, throughout this process I have learned and am still learning so much information, I wouldn't trade these experiences for anything. Love y'all and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it!",
"My boyfriend died today.
I've never posted here before so if I do something wrong I'm sorry in advance. So,  I'll start by saying that I am a grateful, recovering alcoholic. I went to rehab December 5st, 2015. There, I met the most wonderful person I have ever come across in my 25 years of life. Cute, funny, intelligent, interesting, open and honest, a good listener and we had loads of stuff in common but just enough so that we still had other interests that we couldn't wait to show each other. He and I were inseparable, we were head over heels and everyone knew it. He got out of treatment exactly 3 weeks before I did and by the time he had left, we had decided to find a place of our own in San Francisco. While he was waiting for me to get out, he found us an apartment. Our own little place to start our new life together. It's perfect. The size,  the view,  the building. All perfect. We moved in on February 3rd. We've since fully furnished our place and adore everything about it. Nothing in the world feels better than holding someone close in a place you've both put together to call home. A place to feel safe and speak freely. A safe place for us with nothing to trigger us, no drugs or alcohol available. Just each other. Until today. My boyfriend overdosed and died. He'll never be there to comfort me when I'm feeling like I'm going to break. Yesterday, he told me that I am his soul mate and that I'd make a beautiful bride. Today, my whole world ended. 


Edit- thank you all so much.  For your condolences and empowering words.  I still feel like I'm drowning but the support I've been shown has heat me afloat. ",
"I just celebrated 6 months sober
How exciting, I just celebrated 6 months sober. My drug of choice was heroin so in the past I would try to get better by substituting other drugs. I now realize that that just DOES NOT work. The addiction always surfaces again. Tried suboxone, and that is some bad bad shit. This time I just...stopped everything and it really is amazing how much better things are now. I'm currently working on the 4th step which is a grind but I can see it will be very worth the effort. Peace & love to all my people",

"9 Years Today
Hi, recovered alcoholic and meth addict here, just wanted to say hi and let anyone who wants to know that this recovery stuff works.

When I finally realised through 20 years of bitter struggle and multiple attempts to control my drinking that I could not control OR stop altogether I just wanted to know one thing: 


Can I have a cool life sober?

The answer is yes.


Through a good 12 step sponsor, working the steps in the book 'Alcoholics Anonymous', helping others to work the steps,
consistent meditation and prayer and doing service ie: carrying the message at meetings, prisons and detox facilities, I found happiness fir the first time in my life.

Sobriety is real cool for me. 

It has given me more power and peace than I have ever known, as long as I stay in the trenches I believe I will stay sober AND happy.

Thanks for being here, its through people like yourselves that I have recovered, and to *stay recovered*, I just gotta keep giving it away ;)

"I made it a year!
A year ago today I was scared out of my mind not knowing what was ahead of me on the journey to getting sober. Well it sure as heck was not an easy thing to do but I did it with the support of those who love me and for that I am eternally thankful. It really is amazing to try to imagine yourself at your absolute worst and the difference a year can make. While by no means am I 100% cured of addiction nor will I ever be I have accepted the fact this is something that I will have to live with for the rest of my life and you know I'm okay with that it's not shameful to say I've made mistakes because now I can take these experiences and help others. Thank you for reading :)",
"Today I am two weeks sober and I just went to my first AA meeting last night.
I wish that I was able to admit to myself long ago that I had a problem with alcohol.  It was not an easy thing to admit.  I always thought that I was the exception.  As it turns out, everyone thinks that way who is an alcoholic.  I thought that I could control my drinking if I really wanted to; that I had a right to drink.  I am an adult and I can do as I please.  I thought it wasn’t hurting anyone but me.  All lies.

Well I have finally taken the first step, given in and admitted that I have a problem with alcohol.  It’s been two weeks since I have had a drink and I went to an AA meeting last night.

Here is a little background on that.  I had gone to a few meetings in the past, but I didn’t go with an open mind.  When I went, I hadn’t truly admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic.  I went for the wrong reasons. I felt that I didn’t belong and that the people there were not like me.

Yesterday I went in to the AA meeting knowing I had a problem, knowing why I was there and I was willing to give AA a chance.  I couldn’t be more pleased with the results.  It turned out that the group was a great fit for me.  The people there had the same problem as me; they were no different from me.

I knew if I went in and even if it didn’t work that I could find another group and eventually find a place to fit.  I am going to a few other meetings this week.  I had been against AA in the past, but that was a huge part of my problem.  It took humbling myself and sacrificing my misconceptions and misbeliefs and opening my heart and mind to what it could be.

I am an atheist and I don’t know what my higher power can be or will be, but I do know that saying I don’t want to go because its “spiritual” was a bunch of BS.  I had to let myself have an open mind.  I don’t have to believe in God or religion.  I just have to go, find a sponsor and do the steps.  I have nothing to lose by doing this.  I have EVERYTHING to lose by drinking…. Including my life.

Thanks for reading my post.

"I'm totally fucking heartbroken. Now I get why they say don't sleep with anyone in early recovery.
Luckily, I didn't sleep with him.  I ran into this guy I went to high school with at a meeting and was really attracted to him.  The feeling was mutual.  We are both early in recovery so agreed to take things slow.  We weren't hanging out a lot, but hanging out after meetings.  We made out once.  

On Thursday he tried to get me to sleep with him and I almost did it.  I told him I really wanted to but thought it was worth waiting for.  I wanted to be sure it wasn't just about sex for him.

Apparently it was, because tonight we all went out after a CA meeting and he was hitting on chicks left and right, culminating in a huge flirtatious conversation and getting a girl's number 2 feet from where I was sitting.  

I'm so glad I didn't sleep with him because to be honest, this shit makes me want to use.  I'm not going to, but still.  This whole thing has been awful for my sobriety.  I learned my lesson and won't make this mistake again.

"3 years sober today.  The promises are real.
I have 3 years of sobriety today.  The promises are real.  

About 9 years ago, in the spring of 2002, I realized I had a drinking problem.  It had progressed from weekend social drinking, to weekend benders, to light drinking during the week to heavy drinking every night.  I usually blacked out, and would wake up with no sense of what time or day it was, or where I had been or how I had gotten home.  I got into arguments / fights with friends, was kicked out of school, and destroyed my career.

My family and friends packed me off to a fancy 28 day rehab in the mountains.  I fought and argued with the program, thinking I could do it myself if only these stupid people would leave me alone.  I stayed sober for 3 days after leaving.

I gave up on trying to salvage my friends and career and let myself drink full time.  I burned through $8000 in savings in about 4 months of constant intoxication.   When I was completely broke and despondent, I entered another rehab, this time for 2 months.  After leaving I moved to another state.  I stayed sober another 5 weeks.  

My friends moved on with their lives and my family mostly wrote me off.  I worked odd jobs and pawned most of my possessions to support my drinking.  I was arrested several times , spent a few weekends in jail, got into fights in bars and on the street, was evicted from my apartment, and was taken to detox more times than I can remember.  I tried to kill myself and was found by a neighbor in a pool of my own blood.  I spent a month in a psychiatric hospital, and was loaded to the gills with various medications.

I spent about 3 years as a ‘transient’.  Not quite homeless, but moving from one cheap motel to another, staying with other people.  Everything I owned fit into a duffel bag and small backpack.  I worked day labor, picked up random construction jobs, etc.  Typically I would work when I could find work, for as long as I could put off the compulsion to drink.  Never more than 5 days in a row, but I would occasionally be able to sober up enough to show up to work on Monday for several weeks in a row.  More often I would work for 3 or 4 days, buy a few packs of cigarettes and a jug of cheap vodka, and spend the next two days in a semi-comatose state in a small, squalid apartment.  I only went outside to buy more booze.
After a good 4 or 5 day bender I would be out of money.  Usually I would not be in any condition to work or even leave the apartment.  That was when I would have to go through withdrawal.  I would get the shakes to where I couldn’t trust myself not to collapse on the sidewalk.  I would run fevers and sweat profusely, and then suddenly my inner thermostat would change and I would be shivering in my now wet clothes and sheets.  I don’t know how many times I pissed my own bed because generally I would pass out for so long and so hard it would dry before I woke up.  I would be ravenously hungry, but my body couldn’t handle more than a bite or two of solid food.  I would drink juice, or stir some sugar into tap water to keep me going until my digestive system straightened out.  The first 12 hours of withdrawal I would vomit so often I kept a jug of water on the nightstand and a towel folded on the floor next to the bed.  That way I wouldn’t have to get up and crouch over the sink or toilet.  It was mostly water anyways, mixed with stomach acid.  This helped absolutely destroy my teeth.  After a day of this, I usually felt well enough to rinse the stink off me, put on some marginally clean clothes, and find something to eat.  If I could scrape together a dollar or two I could buy some noodles or something from the convenience store.  If I got steady early enough (by noon) I would go to the soup kitchen.

That was my life.

On July 8 2008 I was coming down from another bender.  I was trying to stave off withdrawal by nursing what little vodka I had left.  I had maybe 3 dollars to my name.  I remember it wasn’t enough to get drunk off of or to buy any cigarettes.  The landlord had told me that I was behind on the rent and he wasn’t going to put up with my shit anymore.  I knew the DTs were only a few hours away, and that this hellish process was going to repeat itself again.

I opened the phone book and began calling different clinics and social workers.  Finally I found a hospital (not a rehab) that was willing to take me on the state Medicaid type insurance I had.  I checked in late that evening, and woke up sober on July 9th, 2008.

Today my life is very different.  I wake up full of energy and go to a job I enjoy.  I have a supervisory position with a fair amount of responsibility and influence.  I’m not a CEO but I’m well paid and happy.  

I’m 6 ft tall and went from 170lbs at admission to 195lbs now.  It’s mostly muscle.  I got my teeth fixed.  I look great if I may say so myself.

Most importantly I have a beautiful girlfriend who loves me.  I have friends – not drinking buddies – friends.  My family returns my calls, they invite me for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  I have a car for the first time in 8 years, I have savings.  I travel, I go out and do fun things.  I’m HAPPY.  

**TLDR**
The Promises are real.  No matter how low you are, how fucked up you think your life is or how hopeless you feel, you can get sober.  You can overcome addiction and reclaim your life.  And it’s worth it.  You’re worth it.

"5 Years
5 years ago today, I was making plans for one last party. I'd been strung out on benzos and opiates for a solid year. My health was shot, basically not taking care of a few minor illnesses in order to keep milking prescriptions. I was tired and I was done, so I had gathered a ton of drugs, coke, e, hash oil, xanax, ativan, oxy... going to have one last bash with a few close 'friends'.

I took a nap, and when I got up, my living room was full of people. My first thought, honest to god, was 'I don't have enough e for all these people'. My second thought was, 'of course, my intervention'. I started laughing. I laughed and laughed until I had to sit down. No one knew what I was laughing at. My sister thought it was the irony of me, the ultimate party guy, finally reaching that point. My wife thought I was being an asshole. I was laughing because I was relieved. I told them, 'Let's go, you don't have to read any letters, let's go'. They worked hard on those letters though, and wanted a chance to vent. I don't remember them, not then. I kept them, and read them after my first birthday. 

The first three days of detox were a nightmare. Even with the benefits of modern pharmacology, I was a mess, paranoid, talking to myself, muttering threatening things under my breath. I tried to disable the security cameras. I tried to get my best friend to kidnap my son, so I could leave and meet him somewhere, flee the country before my wife could finish arranging to keep him from me forever, which is what I was sure was her plan, her reason for having me locked up in a rehab, with no wallet and no transportation.

On day three, I was empty. I was done. I surrendered. I got on my knees and I asked a universe that I was certain was empty, for help. If there's anything out there, please, I don't want to live this way anymore. Up until this point, as long as I could remember, going back 35 years, there had been a hole inside me. A gaping black place that I could always feel. I had tried to fill it with a million things, going back to childhood. My grandmothers christianity, occult dabblings, games, then drugs and women. Nothing ever filled it. Three days without drugs, the longest I had gone in more than 15 years, and that hole was so vivid and painful it was the realest thing in the universe. 

I asked any gods that were listening, for any help they could give.

And in that moment, I felt something. A tiny grain of something, hope? Faith? I believed for a second that I could get better, that I was not going to die this way, and that tiny speck of hope felt like a mountain, in a place so empty.

I haven't had the desire to use drugs or alcohol since. I joined a 12 step recovery program, I got a sponsor and I did everything they asked me to do. My life today is better than I could ever have imagined. 

Everyone out there who's my brother or sister in fellowship, thank you.",

"7 days clean from speed
Today I am 7 days clean from amphetamines. I have also been taking wellbutrin for 7 days, as I've done well on it in the past and it is often prescribed off-label for recovering stim addicts. It seems to be helping with my energy levels, although it's definitely making me a lot more bitchy. 

I feel okay today. I've been taking everything slow and have reduced my expectations for myself with regards to being productive. I just feel so slow and stupid. When I was using, I could crush out homework so quickly with no problem.

My biggest fear is that I'm always going to be slow and stupid without the drugs. I justed started studying my masters in a STEM field after graduating from undergrad with distinction. I'm terrified that the good grades and scholarships and awards were only possible because I was using amphetamines. I'm scared that it was only the drugs making me smart.

I kicked benzo dependence several months ago, but I was never truly addicted to the benzos. I was dependent, but I never took them to get high or hide from my problems, only because I wanted to sleep after too much speed. Amphetamines are a whole different league because I actually love the high and, more importantly, what I am able to accomplish academically and productivity-wise when I'm using. 

I'm really just banking on my energy levels and cognitive ability improving with time. Also, my desire for closer and more genuine relationships is a big motivator for me getting clean.

However, I admit I am proud for making it this far. I haven't been clean for this long in many months.

Edit: I just want to add that I would love to hear stories from other recovering speed addicts and gain insight into what I can expect as far as concentration and cognitive ability recovering after getting clean. I have lurked for a long time but I've never posted until now. Would love some support or insight. Thanks. ",
"In 8 hours I’ll be 21 weeks sober from opiates.
Hello fellow Redditors in Recovery, 

First time posting here. Hope you’re all staying strong and well, and for those suffering, hang in there and trust the process. Everyone is different and I don’t wish to drop anymore mindless motivational platitudes... just if you really focus on fixing one domain of your life at a time, things will improve, and they’ll start to improve exponentially quicker than you think. 

I don’t have too much to say, just that I’m on the brink of 21 weeks and I’m feeling back to normal. That is to say, my body has reached homeostasis, I’m sleeping well, and I’m not assailed by wild and volatile mood swings. Just the normal kind, good and bad days, all that. Summer is here and is the time of my greatest happiness and comfort, and I am grateful for every day that I’m not enslaved to 30mg Oxy pills.

One of the greatest things that’s helped me get through these past few months has been to engage myself in learning something. I play music as a hobbyist, and while I’m comfortable saying I’m pretty good, there’s always something I can improve upon, and to get lost for hours and to start seeing positive results from your efforts yields a very enduring sense of satisfaction. Time slows down, and also speeds up. It’s weird. But as long as I’m learning something, music, some philosophy, math, whatever it may be, I never regret the time spent. It makes me feel renewed I guess, like I’m in a process of Becoming something new. 

With great affection,

Sevil Drib",

"meth and sex addict in recovery for ~2years, sober for ~1 year (x-post /r/addiction)
tldr; meth and sex addict doing the thing and living free and happy now, get with me

new to reddit, wanting to reach out to a wider community. i don't meet a lot of people successfully recovering from meth addiction, and i meet very few people recovering from meth addiction AND sex addiction like myself. I'm sure there are people out there doing it, because I'm doing it, so lets get together c:

I've been sober for over a year now. I'm gay, and when i found meth in the bathhouse it was perfect for what i wanted - crazy, destructive sex on crazy, destructive drugs with friendly welcoming people (just kidding they were all crazy and destructive, like me). i was 19.. that was seven years ago. i was diagnosed with hiv four years ago, tried to kill myself later that year.. i really didn't expect to live to see another year, let alone four. life is totally different for me today, its absolutely surreal. i have friends (i had none), a job that pays rent and bills (and is legal), I'm going to school and have so much joy in my life.

one reason I want to reach out is that recovering for meth can be extremely demoralizing. i think its something chemical about that drug, but i felt like i had lingering effects for 6months or more. i felt like i would never stop having cravings... i would get the taste of shooting up and it would last for ten, twenty, sometimes thirty minutes. it just.. gets better over time. and the literature on people with a fusion of meth and sex does not have very optimistic statistics on the possibility of recovering... but stastics don't apply to the individual, and I'm living proof of that. 

i want to reach out to those of y'all suffering out there, give whatever support and hope i can because it can be done. early recovery might be total hell, but there is a life of joy, freedom and ease on the other side of that hell. we just have to stick together and take it one day at a time. ",
"If you've suffered childhood trauma, you're 4600% more likely to become an injecting drug user than if you haven't. We then go on to treat addicts in a way that seems designed to keep them hooked - Yohann Hari
“When we look at addicts, if we are honest – and I feel it too, even though I have loved many addicts in my life – it’s hard to keep out voices of moral judgement. We look at somebody who is chronically using alcohol or drugs, and we say with a shake of the head: “Well, I wouldn’t do that.” By the end of my journey, I had realized that makes as much sense as looking at somebody who has had their legs amputated after a car crash and saying: “Cutting off your legs is weird. I would never do that.” Addicts have been in car crashes of the soul.”

"A lesson I learned early in recovery.
I was about 6 months sober and the AA international convention was coming to a city near me. I was asked to volunteer and accepted because my sponsor told me to always accept commitments. My mind was always playing tricks on me though, so I was scared to buy a ticket to the convention because I was uncertain I could stay sober long enough to make it through 6 more months. I told a friend and he asked me the following question, ""did you stay sober today?"" I replied, ""yeah,"" and he said, ""well what did you do to stay sober today?"" I replied, ""I prayed, went to a meeting, called my sponsor, worked on steps, and tried to help others."" He responded, ""well do that shit tomorrow and you should be fine then, too."" Since that moment nearly 4 years ago, I've never worried about my ability to stay sober long term. Work on your sobriety one day at a time and ""one day at a time"" easily turns  into ""one day at a time in a row.""  ",
"Alcohol is a drug.
I’m glad weed and pills were my drug of choice bc I would have never got sober in AA if it was alcohol I would still be in denial and I probably would have kept using alcohol never finding this better easier life.  Alcohol is only useful when your using it.  Then it’s a depressant only depending on you using more for the effect.  I learned I can raise my bottom in AA.  I learned I can have an easier life without the pills and weed.  All I had to do was come to terms that I’m an addict no matter the drug and celebrate life with others who suffer.  It’s awesome.",

Got with a new therapist today and he is really fantastic. We were talking and just going over things and i told him that, you know i'm young (23) and i feel like i should be able to have fun (and by fun i mean do drugs) and he just looks at me and says: ""There will always be time to do drugs, but you never know how much time u have to live. ""  I could die tomorrow, so why not get clean and sober and enjoy life instead of wasting my time on drugs.  Why not live my life and have a good time, instead of risking my life on drugs. 

And idk, that just really hit me hard. After words, he pulled out one of those cups you pee in and he was like, if you're comfortable i would like to test you and make sure you're still on track and i passed!

Hi I'm new to this. My sister told me this could help me out. Just reading a few posts I realized that it can. So I decited to tell a little story.
I was born in Europe. Came here in 2004 started using in young age 16-17 never stopped till now. Now I'm 24 I lost my way in life. I lost respect from people I love. 99 percent of my family doesn't know about my addictions untill now. I told my sister and that's something I thought I would never be able to do. But I managed with some tears and emotions I truly explained to her who I am and how has my life been crumbling since I became a addict. 
She accepted me for who I am now we are in a process of getting me back out into the world 
I'm 25 now 2.5 month free of drugs and a mind full of Improvements. My road to healthy lifestyle is a long one but I will do what ever it takes.

"You can't ""Save"" anyone
Today I had to confront my Roomate about using in the house. I've had my suspicions but last night it all clicked. 

My best friend asked me who I brought to the meeting and I said my roommate, he responded with, he's clean? I said yeah he's got over a year.....

 Then I started backtracking on his behaviors the past week or two.

Today very long, stressful, emotional day all around. From having to confront him, to finding his needle, to trying to find him treatment for hours, to knowing he didn't have a place to go, to hoping he was going to be  alright. All I could do was be there for support, hug him and wish him well. Luckily he was scholarshiped into a detox 

It's extremely tough to not try and ""save"" someone, especially one you care for. This is a program of ATTRACTION , not promotion. The best thing I could do was take a step back, and let him hit his bottom, and become willing.

But I am grateful this happened, not only could this have saved his life, but i was reminded just how shitty life is in active addiction.

"7 years sober, and I'm sick and tired of AA
Anyone else get like this? I've been through the 12 steps and have sponsored a few people, but something is definitely wrong with my life right now and AA/the program just doesn't seem to give me any juice anymore. I'm actually hating going to meetings and if I reach to my friends and sponsor, I just get the same old cliche fucking responses that are driving me up the wall. I honestly think I'm depressed and need some outside therapy - I recognize that AA is a way of getting me away from drinking and is not a cure-all. Is it terrible if i just take a break from it and focus my life on recovery from depression? Fuck.

EDIT: thanks for all the help everyone, I'm going to seek out a therapist for sure. furthermore I'm going to start getting a few other things in my life that are lacking...like a new creative endeavor, some traveling, and some other spiritual practices that I've been watching help others (there's a few meditation/buddhist groups in my area, and I know some AA peoples that get a lot out of attending that stuff). But yeah, some therapy is needed for sure.",

"How waffles help me understand ""god""
When I first started recovery I realized that I could not understand god, and I did not need to. Here is how I understand today.

Assume for a minute that something created me, cares for me, loves me, and has a plan for me. These are the characteristics of a higher power implicit in the 12 Steps, right? ""power greater than myself"", ""care of god"", ""god's will for us"", that sort of thing, right?

While I was using I thought I was the center of the universe, so the next bit of this thought experiment came pretty easy. What would it be like to **be** a Higher Power? I know, I can make waffles. I love waffles. I have a plan for waffles. Heck, they can help me carry out my plan, right? OK, so I am my waffle's higher power.

Do waffles understand me? Nope. Do they need to? Nope. They just have to be waffles. 

And from my perspective it is a good deal. I get yummy waffles that fuel me all morning, giving me the power to do good, or whatever. 

From the waffle's point of view though, it kind of sucks. To the waffle this ""higher power"" is going to chew him up and use him and in the end he is just poop. 

So, do I, as god's waffle, focus on the fact that I am dying a little bit every day, that life is hard and painful, and just not fair? Or do I rejoice in the fact that I get to be covered in sweetness for a short time until I can help fuel the love of the cosmos in some small way?

Today I will try to be of service to my fellow waffles.",

"Just hit 21 days clean
I woke up 21 days ago and decided I had enough.  I have smoked pot since I was 16, regularly for the last 10 years since I was 18, and drank daily in varying quantities for the last 8 years.  I was drinking 750ml of bourbon or rye every 4 days in addition to beer and wine for the last two years.  I had the shakes at night for the first week and they have gone for the most part, but I have been having a terrible time getting good sleep.  I am not bothered in the daytime by symptoms but all night seems to suck for several nights a week.  I have the stoned feeling in my limbs, tingly and twitchy, hoping that goes away soon.  Even with that, I have had no desire to go back to booze or weed, so I feel very happy with where I am at right now, and I have dropped 10 pounds in the first three weeks without the booze and the snacking.  I don't really have anyone in my circle who knew the extent of my habits so I am just venting/sharing here.

"5 and a half years sober and I'm miserable
I was one of those guys who was head over heels in love with the program. I went from a heroin junkie who had been in and out of jail and prison for 10 years, to a homeowner and addiction counselor, and my life just seemed amazing. I became a person I really liked and got married and had a little girl.  A couple years ago my marriage fell apart due to my mother-in-law committing suicide. My ex just lost it. Sadly, after 8 months of trying to fix the marriage, I was through with being lied to and cheated on. We got divorced and my ex relapsed.  She ended up abusing and neglecting my daughter several times pretty severely. Luckily I documented everything and was able to get full custody of our daughter.  My ex lives in another state now and has a new baby with her new boyfriend, and they both actively drink and use. Thankfully, my little girl is doing extremely well after several months of therapy - almost like nothing happened.  She is very smart and I get amazing reports from her teachers.  I am back in school full-time trying to get my Master's so I can provide the life I want for us.
After I became a single parent, my life changed drastically. Friendships fizzled out and eventually died, my social life is non-existent (obviously), and my meeting attendance and program involvement has stopped totally. I still keep in touch with people I care about from meetings but it's fairly superficial.  Every night she goes to bed around 7:30 and I clean the house and make her lunch for the next day and eat my dinner. And then the loneliness sets in. There's a woman I've been seeing for about a month who I care about immensely, and our relationship is great, but the times when I'm alone are so hard.  I find myself choking up and wanting to cry for no reason, or breaking down in tears at vaguely sad Facebook videos.  I feel very alone. I used to feel like I had dozens of people I could talk to, but now I feel like there's no one.  My group of close friends has been steadily drifting apart since one of our group relapsed and killed himself last year, and we don't talk much anymore. I don't feel like I can speak to my family about my feelings because I don't want them to worry about me relapsing. I have a lot on my shoulders and I just feel so isolated. I have told the woman I'm dating about a lot of this, but I don't want to constantly just emotionally dump on her because I have no one else.  It's a shitty feeling. After the extremely messy divorce, there was an adjustment period where I had to figure out how to do life as a single parent of a young child. It's possible that I just became very action-oriented at that point to avoid processing the pain of what had happened. And maybe now that things are smoother, the feelings are coming out. I don't know. I just know that I'm tired of feeling so sad all the time. ",
"One year!
A year ago today I got home from a drug fueled festival and realized that throwing a month of sobriety away had totally not been worth it. Then a few days later when I had a crisis around almost using but overcame the urges, I realized that counting time was something that actually mattered to me. This date marks a year of doing the next right thing, and all of the magic that's come from that. It's still hard to believe that I'm happier without drugs, but looking back the evidence speaks for itself.

Last week I spent some time with my family, and got an update on my uncle. He's someone from whom alcohol has taken a lot. Lost his career in law, multiple DUIs, lots of time spent in jail, and finally a wife who had stuck with him for years before he burnt the bridge forever. Didn't have any relationship with his two kids for years. Anyway, he's finally gotten his shit together and started to turn things around. Speaking to his kids again, taking care of his body, and stringing together time. I asked my parents how long it had been and I was blown away to hear them reveal that it had been over \*5 years\* since he's drank. What the fuck!? It feels like this dudes time feels like it's been a blip on the radar to me because he hasn't been actively involved in my life, and yet it turns out he's got as much time as my biggest role model in recovery. I think that revelation was my own journey's way of reminding me to stay humble.

As some of you know, back on May 10th, 2018, I got the Naltraxone pallet inserted in me for my opiod and Kratom cravings which were unbearable. 

Today I had to run a few errands and was driving past the smoke shop where I would get my Kratom. Because I needed cigarettes, I pulled into the parking lot, got out of my car and walked into the store. My eyes went directly to where the Kratom was. Because I've been a customer of that shop for a long time, the clerk asked me where I've been and said ""one?' as he was reaching for the Kratom extract. I said ""nope, just a pack of Marlboro red."" The cravings were almost non existent. It was amazing.

"Last Saturday was my 10 year anniversary of quitting World of Warcraft cold turkey
I was browsing my [Facebook ""On this day""](https://imgur.com/a/GpBkg) and stumbled across a status I made 10 years prior, celebrating ""beating the addiction.""  I know some think video games can't be an addiction, but at the time I was playing 12-14 hours per day, 7 days per week.  WoW cost me my fiance, my job, many of my friends, and even relationships with some of my family members.  I racked up student debt because I was completely living off of it, since I would skip work, or leave early to participate in raids.  I put on 60 pounds and topped out at  Even on the rare occasions that I would go out with friends, I would often be texting with other people I knew who I played WoW with (even though I didn't know any of them in real life).

I can distinctly remember my 23rd birthday, my fiance got a bunch of friends together to go out to BW3s for my birthday.  My guild had been bashing our heads on Vaelstrasz (second boss in Blackwing Lair) for almost two weeks, and were finally about to beat him.  All I could think about that night was how much I wanted to be there, raiding with my guildmates, and the loot I wanted to drop.  By the time I quit, I had right around 450 days played between all of my alts.  To put that in mathematical perspective, WoW had been out barely over three years by the time I quit.  That's just over 1100 days.  In other words, I spent around 41% of my life, for three years, playing that game.

Older, wiser me knows that you never truly beat addiction to something completely, you just win each battle one day at a time.  So here I am now, 10 years and two days clean.  Since then I've finished my bachelor's degree, become gainfully employed, I'm happily married, and have lost all of the weight that I put on, and been a part time CrossFit coach for the last three years, in addition to my full time job.  I still play video games, just far more casually now, and no more MMOs.  The itch to play WoW is still there; it's always calling to me, but I've made promises to my wife and to myself that I'd never pick it up again, and I intend to stay true to that promise.",

"I relapsed on Meth tonight after 8 months of sobriety.
I had gone around 8 months without smoking meth. Last time I had done it was around New Years, 2016. In these 8 months I have drank and I have smoked weed about 3-4 times, in social settings. A few beers doesn't seem to hurt, and I've scared myself straight (stupidly) with a DUI. I do tend to get depressed and drink to feel better, but I understand it's a temporary fix, so I now refuse to get out of control with that. Unfortunately, I feel as if I don't have a reliable group of friends. They all DO smoke constantly and drink constantly and it is very hard to be around them and feel like I fit in. They say they enjoy my company, but honestly I just feel like a shell when I'm around them and it's not my place to tell them that their habits make me uncomfortable. I should simply not be around it, but it is hard when I feel as if I don't have anyone else to be around.

But this is about the meth, mostly. I am losing my train of thought... I only had one hit tonight when I met up with some people to do the whole gay-pnp stuff. It is a ritual. I don't smoke otherwise, and it seems I have more than one addiction and now it looks like porn is really becoming an issue. Heavy porn use has probably contributed to this, but as well as not feeling like I am ""enjoying"" my sexuality as much as everyone else. I feel very sexually stunted. It just seems to stem all from such a young age. There's so much here that I don't feel comfortable posting but I have had an extremely strange and regretful sexual adolescence, to say the least. I just feel so alone. I'm looking for ways to put the blame on others but I am the only one to blame for the situation I'm in. I just feel so much regret. Suicide really is just a daily thought. I feel bombarded with negativity all around me on a daily basis and just the unforgiving nature of reality. I really wish I didn't relapse tonight, I wish I could have gone a full year. I wish I had felt enough satisfaction from quitting for 8 months that I would not have done it tonight, but apparently, I that wasn't enough for me.

"659 days clean.
I've never been on this reddit before but I just wanted to give y'all some hope. I was a severe cocaine and Xanax abuser who stole, robbed and fought for money to keep my addiction fed. I was 22 years old living at home and had dropped out of college, and had been in and out of jail. I had lost all my friends and and family except for my father. I finally took his last straw by selling his prized watch for quite a bit of money. I had the option of rehab or some lengthy jail time, and I chose to get help. I remember think people with 30 days were nuts but it's possible. I've lost many people since I've got clean to overdoses and suicides that could have easily been me. My life has made a complete turn around in such a short time and it's a blessing. I am back in college, just moved into a home with my girlfriend and I am working for a new start up rehab facility that is a big name in my neck of the woods. I get some people come off the street at their lowest point and see them leave feeling more happy and hopeful than they have in years. It never ceases to amaze me the amount of change that happens in recovery.
    There will be long hard days but there will be twice as many days that you wish would last longer so you could have more time to take in all the amazing thing that happen after getting clean. If you need help or are struggling while in recovery talk to someone, or open your big book and read, it has saved my life many times. Thank all of you for uplifting posts about how things have changed or gotten better for you. It truly brings joy to my heart. ",

"Christmas Day 2016 is my 2 year sobriety anniversary. I made a short list of things I learned along the way.
1. There is no such thing as rock bottom. I can always end up somewhere worse, unless I'm dead.

2. If I think to myself ""If x happened, I would get clean"", then I'm not really interested in getting clean.

3. I became a better liar, a better manipulator, and a better thief, when my addiction was on the line.

4. The first time I told someone, I didn't feel relieved, I felt scared. That fear never went away.

5. I didn't even trust my own promises, so how could I expect others to trust in them?

6. Recovery. Is. So. Goddamned. Slow.

7. Celebrate each day as if it were a 1 year anniversary.

8. A bad day sober is still 10 times better than the worst day high.

9. Planning for the future helps me forget about the past.

10. If they are still my friend, hold them close, thank them as often as possible, and never let go, because they loved me more than I loved myself.


I hope this helps you guys, even a little. My experience was different though. I was addicted from 2008-2014, on and off, where I would have 6-7 really bad months, then a month clean. I ran out of money, lost jobs, lost family. I ended up with a criminal record. The moment I decided to get clean was prompted by something you might see as silly... a moment with my aging and arthritic dog, where I couldn't help him get up the stairs because my arms were too weak. I know it sounds stupid, but it was in that moment I realized that I couldn't care for anyone, least of all myself, and I needed to change. No matter what your reason is, stick with it.

Ive managed to stay clean well over a year on basically a series of okays, fines, sures, and why nots. It started with a scared, intense, and honestly skeptical willingness, but turned in to this loving laid back idea. My willingness to do this originally was like a 6 year old screaming with his eyes shut, *finally* doing his chores because he had run out of all other options. Now my recovery looks more like a welcome shrug and a ""sure, why not?""

If you're new to recovery, and you're not sure if you want to do this, that's okay. If you're not sure if you even *can* do this, that's okay too- I didn't think I could either.

I used to hide and numb my feelings for my entire adult life, so when I actually started to feel emotions it was overwhelming and a complete shock to sit with those feelings all the way through. But I kept being self aware and kept talking to myself knowing not picking up was the only way I can live the life I know I'm capable of. 

Please, don't ever give up, I'm no first time winner. I've ""lost"" too many times before, but when I look back with a clear head I realize now how each ""failure"" taught me something new. If anyone has any questions, wants to talk, or even vent without an answer, please don't hesitate to pm me. I love you all, let's work together to stay sober ❤",

"The promises do come true!
I have been in recovery for 26 months from an opioid addiction that lead to my being terminated from my dream job/career. My addiction was devastating on its own, but losing the job that was supporting my family was one of the worst repercussions of using. I'd gone to graduate school with the support of my husband (he literally paid for it and worked while I went full time) so that when I finished he could retire. And retire he did, 6 months after I started working. Things were going well for several years until my actions caught up with me.

The reason for my termination has followed me for the past 22 months. Every application I've filled out, I've had to list the exact reason I was let go (a requirement of disclosure in my profession) and that has led to nothing but rejection. It's been disheartening. We went into debt so I could go to treatment and we're still paying it off little by little. I had to cash out my retirement. I've been without health insurance (I was also covering my husband through my employer)--the list goes on, the absolute mess I made.

Finally--last week, an employer decided I was worth it. A second chance. I will finally be on the road back to success in my career. I've been steadily working on recovery during these past 26 months and every area of my life (marriage, family, kids) has improved so much--the only thing missing was a job. I was almost ready to give up.

I feel like I've been smiled upon at last for continuing to do the next right thing. I wanted to share a hopeful experience for others who might be thinking that recovery isn't worth it. It absolutely is.",
"My Drug Abuse Story
I have been getting caught up in psychedelics drugs recently, Shrooms, LSD, DMT, anything to keep me in that good vibe. I used these drugs as an outlet for my problems, issues, relationship troubles, anything that hurt me. I know that drugs are bad, and I continue to do them, I don't understand why I can't stop or get some help from someone, usually people ward me off, telling me to just continue and not worry about it. I know Reddit is the last place I should go to for help... I've had suicidal thoughts recently, and I just need help. You don't have to comment, just Upvote so I can know you care at least.",
"Six months clean and serene.
And today marks 6 months clean from IV meth, heroin, and alcohol. My longest clean time yet!

If you're wondering if recovery works...Today, I never get hangovers, dope sick, or psychosis. I have a home, car, job, and friends that actually care about me. I'm no longer degraded and used, I have dignity today. I live a life of serenity and hope, not of violence, sickness and insanity. I have a baby on the way who will not be born addicted to drugs, and will never see mom under the influence. I think the biggest change of all is that I have hope for the future. My obsession to use has been lifted. I take part in my recovery today instead of taking up a space in NA while I waited for my next bag. Miracles happen!",
"The Craving is a memory, and The Memory is a Trick.
Heard this from a drug counselor who ran group sessions for cocaine addicts for many years, and has seen every story or heard every excuse a hundred times over. 

He told me that no craving ever caused a relapse. Cravings are normal human behavior, and there is no way to stop them. It's the ""permission-giving thoughts"" that cause relapses when we give in to the craving. But you don't have to let cravings overpower you when you understand what they are. 

Cravings for food or shelter or sex are natural, and hardwired into our human brains. Those needs are necessary for survival and will always be there. The craving for cocaine is artificial, we have inserted it there, and it may never go away completely, but it will lose strength over time. 

Do not fear a craving, for they are bound to happen. Consider a craving to be a Memory, a recollection of how good it was to fill a need. And remember that for all needs, all cravings, the brain remembers that fulfillment by highlighting the pleasure, and downplaying the pain. This is an important survival instinct for humans, to remember, for example, how good the prey tasted while forgetting how dangerous it was to hunt for it.

The Craving is a Memory, but your brain remembers it with bias, telling you it was mostly good, and not much bad. For the human needs and natural cravings, this is good. For the artificial cravings for drugs, this is a trick. Because the pleasure of being high is not worth the damage to our bodies and the pain of losing our relationships. Remember that.

Do not fear the Craving. It will come, sure enough. But it's just a Memory of how it used to be, and the Memory is distorted to favor the pleasure and forget the pain. 

The Craving for drugs may turn up in a week, or 2 months, or 5 years, or 30 years. But it's just the Memory of an artificial need, and your brain is tricking you to forget the pain. Now that you can see how the trick works, you can stop falling for it.",

"One Year
I never would have thought that it was possible for me to live a clean life. One year ago I thought I needed drugs/alcohol in order to survive. To say that my life was controlled by drugs is an understatement.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I have been seeing shrinks since I was 9 and been on different medications for such things. I did not think that it was possible for me to be happy, much less without the medications or drugs.

A great big thank you to NA for my life, family, and happiness I never knew was possible.

"One Year Sober,
And while I feel overwhelming gratitude and accomplishment for this anniversary, it also feels just like any other day. 

I'm just hanging out at my apartment, which I rent with my best friend I met out here in the midwest. I'm hanging out with our new kitty on the couch, before heading to a job I love. I just went to a meeting a block from my home, a first step meeting, which is always humbling. 

I can't begin to describe how full of joy I am for all the gifts sobriety has given me. My family loves me and trusts me- they want to be a part of my life. I have wonderful friends, both ""normal"" and in recovery, and I can't thank them enough for everything they've done for me since moving across the country to get sober. 

I had to change *everything* to have what I have today. And today, everything seems so... normal. It's just any other day. I'm taking care of myself, I work the steps, I work full time, I go on adventures with friends, I try to love with all my heart and let go of judgment, etc. etc., and when I romanticize the chaos that addiction brings, I remind myself that nothing compares to how good things are today. 

22 years old, never thought sobriety would be a way of life for me, let alone a fun one. Changed my people, places, and things, and the gifts of sobriety followed. And they continue to follow me.

"A moment of silence for those that still suffer, and those that suffer no longer
A little more than 4 years ago my family decided they were tired if watching me commit slow (but rapidly accelerating) suicide with drugs and booze. They had no idea what to do, so they called a rehab. The rehab gave them the name of a man who could help them get me to get some help. He was an interventionist. They couldn't pay him up front his normal fee, but he said not to worry, they could pay him what they could, when they could. He was scheduled to come do it on a Sunday, but they were so worried about me dying they begged him to come a day early, so he did. He got it all organized, helped them write their letters, got it all ready a day early. After they read them, he sat with me out back while I smoked and thought about the choice I had been offered. He told me he had been addicted to heroin and booze, and that there was a better way. He let me listen to Pink Floyd on the way to the hospital and helped me check myself in.

I ran I to him a few times, as I began to get my life back together. Then when I went to a meeting to take my 6 month chip, at an AA meeting at the hospital I had gone to for rehab, I saw him, wearing a patient bracelet. After 9 years sober, he had relapsed, only a three day run, but it had ended with him overdosed on a bus bench. 

I rarely heard from him after that. I'd heard from mutual acquaintances in the recovery community that he was struggling.

This morning my sponsor called me. He told me Jeff, my interventionist, was found dead in a flea bag motel in Tijuana. 

I don't know what else to say about this. I tried to share it on my Facebook, but those people don't really get it. They're all saying things like ""be strong"" and ""we're their for you"" as though this is a threat to my sobriety. They couldn't be more wrong. This man gave me the two greatest gifts to my recovery. First, he shared his story with me and convinced me that maybe, just maybe, there was a way out, and with his death he gives me a reminder that I must be forever vigilant, because no matter what, I will never be completely cured, it will never be safe for me to use drugs or alcohol.

Thanks for letting me share.",
"Picked up my 2 month chip today!
Hi, I'm Matthew and I'm an addict/alcoholic.

I am very grateful to have sixty days clean and sober today! It definitely hasn't been an easy road, especially with my step three, but I am very excited to move forward with my newly found relationship with my higher power whom I choose to call God. I'm currently on my fourth step and I am excited to continue on with my journey. I couldn't have done it without prayer and meditation, and all you folks who fill the rooms every night. Somebody shared something in a meeting today that I really got down with- Our common peril and common solution allows us to speak to each other heart to heart, a language that only only we can truly understand. As hokey as it sounds, I think it's very true and I'm very grateful for the fellowship I've found in AA/CA.

"I'm not giving up
I've written here before during one of my worse relapses. I'm sober this time. An hour ago I walked home from a nightclub. Left my boyfriend and friend to enjoy themselves and allowed myself to do what was best for me. See, I didn't want to drink. Hell, I didn't even want to do drugs. I definitely didn't want to be in a crowded place. I was already dissociating badly and feeling incredibly anxious to be there. My boyfriend told me I could get any drug I wanted, he thought that'd make me feel better. A week ago I would've been ecstatic about that. I would have fooled myself thinking that drugs could make me feel better. They don't actually make me feel better. All drugs have truly done for me is destroy me. That's what I wanted. It's all been for the most part to be self destructive. Even when it's been fun. Thing is I'm done hurting myself. 

I want to be sober. I've done cocaine, speed, MDMA, weed in the past month though. I've been continuing using just because I felt like I had to, if that makes sense. It took some time to understand that I actually don't want to use anymore. A couple of months ago I went on yet another crazy and long speed bender where I really messed up. Almost to the point where I lost everything. But I didn't. I was forgiven and given another chance. That changed something in me even though I'd done it all before. I guess this was just the last straw for me.

Last time I was high was last weekend. Smoked weed again after a long break. I've only smoked a couple of times this year. I used to smoke chronically. I wanted to know what it was like again. And oh boy, it was just too much and yet not enough.

Every time I've been high lately it's been either overwhelming or disappointing. I guess I'm over seeing drugs with heart shaped glasses, you know. Every day I've woken up sober again I've been happy and relieved to be sober. Even if I'm dealing with severe mental illness and my life is a mess I still am happy to be sober. I can't believe that this just happened on its own. I tried to force this change and turns out it just happened when I wasn't trying to force it. You know, for over a year I've wanted nothing but to be high. I used to be convinced that I couldn't deal with being sober. That it's awful to be sober. Well, turns out it's freaking amazing to be sober. To be in control of yourself is the best thing there is.

Walking home I realised that drugs can't give me what I want. I don't even know what I want. I've been looking for something my whole life, something to fill the void. And now I'm starting to accept that I don't need to fill it. Not like this, chasing madly after something I can't even define. All this time I thought I was chasing happiness, sanity, whatever. Now it's clear to me I've been chasing the exact opposite. I've been hurting and hurting myself, wondering why I feel so empty and broken. I've been breaking myself and continuing this awful cycle. I don't want to do that anymore. Be it drugs or other things, I'm done doing that to myself.


I don't want to fool myself with the idea of casual use. I can't do that. When I use I want to keep going until I pull myself inside out. Until I get to a point where I slowly but surely slip into another psychotic break. I get there even without drugs so it's time to stop doing things that push me there quicker. I don't want that anymore. I don't want to fall apart. I don't want to hit the bottom because I've already sunk lower than I ever thought I could and  I know now that I can always go lower. And I just don't want to do that anymore. I'm climbing back up every day. I'll probably stumble on the way but I'll keep going on. Even if I fall down badly I'll keep going on.

I'm not giving up. I'll be frank. A couple of weeks ago I had yet another suicide attempt planned. Been there, done that way too many times. This time it would've been successful 100%. Figured out a way. Ah but something changed. An opportunity to start a new life was offered to me and that was enough to make me fight against that urge to kill myself. It's not easy and I'm not really happy most of the time. I don't think that matters though. What matters is that I live. Every day I fight against this suicidalness in me. I know it will go away again. And come back. But I have control over myself as long as I stay sober and that's truly amazing to realise. 

I just wanted to share these thoughts and this change in me and this is the best place for it, I think.

Keep fighting.

But I always go to my home group. I am still the treasurer and the secretary. I still have a sponsor, and although slowly, I still work the steps. I keep coming back, because I know, if I stop, I will use. 

It works. I was in and out for 4 years before I finally realized , I had to stop. So I did 90 in 90, I got a sponsor, I got a home group, I dumped all my problems on people after the meeting.

"Four Years
Four years ago I overdosed for my third time. Four years ago I watched my best friend overdose and die. Four years ago I decided that I was sick of sitting in the back of cop cars, of spending time in jail, of burying my friends, of waking up in the hospital, of wasting away.

I wasn't sure I could ever get sober. I had spent two years trying. I had a year sober once upon a time and had relapsed hard after a failed relationship - a petty reason in the grand scheme of things, but I wanted any reason to return to my best friend. I decided I'd likely die with a needle in my arm. But four years ago I put that needle down and said that last goodbye to my friend heroin.

I did the impossible - or so I thought - and got sober again.
I stayed sober through long days at work, rejection from friends, fights with family, the loss of a job, mental health issues, loneliness, the loss of my first child. I never thought I'd stay sober. But here I am.

I know it may not seem like a lot compared to other people's milestones, but I am so proud to say I've been completely sober for three weeks!

It all started with weed and drinking, which then lead to a benzodiazepine addiction and frequent usage of DXM. I was combining multiple drugs daily and was never sober for more than a day. 

Recently I overdosed on diphenhydramine (benadryl), and had to be hospitalized. This was when I finally realized that my drug use was not just hurting myself, but people close to me. I was lying and hiding things from my friends and family. I isolated myself from most of my family members and disappointed them immensely. 

This Subreddit has helped me so much in realizing that you really need to want to be clean to get sober. Like I said, three weeks is not a lot compared to others but I feel great. It's like a huge weight has been lifted. I just wanted to remind everyone to never give up! Although things may seem tough, you will turn out a better person in the end.",

"Something I realized today...
Something I Realized Today;

About 10 years ago (what seems to be like 100 years ago), i finally admitted to myself that I had an addiction to alcohol and drugs. It was to the point that I almost couldn't function in society for a single day without drinking or putting something into my body to alter my mind.

It took a long time to lead up to me admitting this to myself. I spent countless nights drinking myself into oblivion, would wake up at 3:00am or 4:00am and reach for an opened can of beer that I would keep on my floor right next to my bed just to take a sip of the warm flat liquid which was my life, scraping up change to buy my next 12-pack, so, that while I was drinking it, I would sit there thinking about where I was going to get money for my next 12-pack, getting up early for work so I was able to slam a couple of drinks just to get the courage to go out in the world and face everyone,....etc..etc . And this went on and on.

I finally got the help I needed and put myself in a rehab. I was in a rehab during the 9-11 attacks on the world trade center. So, my life changed in more ways than one. It wasn't easy at first, and, it took me some time to find myself and to try to make a plan on what i was going to do for the rest of my life. I (for the most part) was doing the ""baby step"" approach. Step 1 - A place to sleep at night. Step 2 - Attending my AA Meetings. Step 3 - Holding a job (this was a big step as I was never able to do this before). Step 4 - Move out of my fathers house and get my own apartment, and so on and so forth.

So, 9+ years later. Here I am. My wonderful wife stayed with me through this entire ordeal (At the time of my rehab, we weren't married, but, she was with me). We have a good life today. We bought a home. She has a good job. I have a good job and (very often) get awards for my performance at work. I've always wanted to work in the I.T. field (With Computers), so, I put my mind to it, and, that is the position I am in today in a very large corporation.

Just last month, a person that i worked with (A Director of Customer Services) left the company. She wasn't happy working here. So, she made a phone call to me asking if she can use me as a reference for a new job. This is the entire purpose of me writing this note.

What I realized : Almost 10 years ago, I was barely able to walk to the store OR hold any kind of a job because of the alcoholic/drug addicted mess I was, and, now, A director of a large company that I work for actually wants to use me as a reference. Not to mention that my company also sent oe to Amarillo Texas for 2 weeks because they trusted that i can do a great job while there. Trusted ""me"".

To the average person, this may not seem like much. But, from where I was, this is a huge accomplishment for me.

I just wanted to remind everyone out there that is in recovery that there is hope. You just have to stay strong and take things 1 day at a time.

"My husband, former IV heroin user wants to use painkillers recreationally
I need advice. 

My husband was an IV heroin addicts for years (maybe 7? I’m not sure) he was on suboxone when we got together and he was on it for a total of 3 years. 

He got off the suboxone 16 months ago.

Since then he has talked about wanting to do opiates (Percocet, Vicodin, hydrocone etc). His friend offered him some today and he is planning on picking them up today after work. 

The only reason I know this is because I was working on the computer when the messages popped up from his Facebook account. 

Every other time I have pleaded and begged him not to because I am so worried about him relapsing and ruining our lives. He has been to prison as a by product of his addiction and went to rehab something like 8 times.

I cannot imagine him being in the throes of addiction because I cannot imagine him hurting the people that he loves. I love my husband so much. There is so much about addiction I do not understand. 

I have done lots of reading and research. 

In my opinion, he should not use opiates recreationally because it has the potential to be catastrophic for us. I would never put our family in the position to hurt us and I can’t understand why he is willing to take that risk. 

 I think he need to put US First and not his wants and needs. 

He says it will be fine because he is different now, and he isn’t as weak as I think he is. 

I think he shouldn’t be putting his recovery in jeopardy. He insists that he just wants to feel good. I insist that he needs different and better coping mechanisms.

I would go to the literal ends of the earth for my husband. Everything I do in life I do for us to have a better future. 

He says he hates that I won’t let him be himself by using opiates recreationally. I know his addiction is something that will have to be managed forever and I knew that coming into this marriage. 

He is acting so flippant about using again because “it will only be once in a while”. How can I get him to see that is is wrong and that he could ruin our relationship?

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with a spouse going through this?? It’s like I can’t reason with him and he thinks that he’s just cured of his addiction now so he can do it again. That because he’s had a steady life since we’ve been together that he’s better now. All those things have only happened because of his sobriety. How can I help him??? 

I’m so scared. 

I’m sorry if you think I am being dramatic but this is a big deal to me. 

EDIT:

Thank you for all the advice. He DID NOT go pick it up. 
We have a lot of work to do moving forward. I would ideally like to get both of us in therapy both separately and together. We are going through a stressful time right now as we are moving entirely across the state so that I can begin law school.  I think that fear of the unknown can be a big trigger.  I would also like to say that I would not have left him if he did go pick it up. However, if he chooses his addiction over me I do realize there will come a time when that choice would need to be made.

Today marks my 100 days free from active addiction. I wanted to share what worked for me. I first accepted I was an addict. I became willing to do whatever it takes to stay sober. I changed my people. I attend meetings regularly. I call my sponsor almost every day and I stay in contact w my higher power. I struggled with active addiction for many years and this is the first time I'm sober I can say I am free.

"Eight years of Xanax and finally had enough
I was 18 when I decided to get medicated for my anxiety. Boy was I naive. I thought Xanax could cure it all when in reality I really didn't need it as much as I thought. I am an addict and the reality is that it was just another thing I could abuse.

I had ramped up to about 7mg a day rather quickly (all this being prescribed. my psychiatrist had extensive research into using xanax for relief of anxiety) . I have been on that regiment for around 7 years until recent. Reflecting on this time, people didn't know the true me anymore, emotions were sparse and I didn't even realize or care to realize even. I never had to deal with problems because I never saw anything AS a problem. This proved difficult with relationships for me. I was an emotional ""zombie""

In the past year I had slowly been weening off my 7mg a day down to about 1mg. I admit, I stayed in this range because I was afraid of what the world is like without this medication. The fear was too strong. I had become weak from not knowing what it is like to deal with everyday problems because I had become a zombie .I even got completely off it over the summer for about 3 weeks and had a pretty brutal panic attack and that's all it took to get me back on it. Back to 1mg and all that work was gone.

This year is a turning point. I had finally decided that enough was enough and I didn't need to rely on this medication any more.

I dropped my dosage to .5 for a few months before and finally quit all together on February 3, 2017.

The past 2 months have been a blur. A mix of depression and anxiety clutter my thoughts. Being completely off Xanax has been one of the toughest things ever.

Mainly large amounts of regret, seemingly stuck on remembering embarassing moments or regretful decisions. This is the hardest. It seems that I must relearn everything again, how to feel and react in situations. The inner monologue is ever more present.

My sense of smell and taste has dramatically changed. I notice a lot more details in every smell... every food. Some beers I've had I cannot drink anymore because of the intense flavor.

I notice things about myself I never noticed before, certain ticks come out. I am very sensitive to external stimuli, bright lights make me jolt. Sometimes I have jolts just out of nowhere. Loud / sharp noises startle me more. I attibute all of this to the withdrawals but am left wondering if maybe it is an unrelated issue I have.. I am irritable and my thoughts are everywhere (as seen in the writing above even, how much I jump around from thought to thought). Feeling crippled by anxiety I wonder if I'll ever get to a point where I do not have to let it control my present mindset. I practice being mindful and letting myself know that what I fear / regret will not help me in the present but just to try to learn from my experiences to better myself.

I will say that my anxiety spikes a lot when smoking THC. I have been smoking since I was a teenager and I guess I am now realizing what it really does to me. I am not sure if this will pass in time, but I guess I am slowly breaking away from my excessive smoking habits because of the negative effects of it. I get stuck in my head more than ever, finding it harder to break free of the spell of panic. I was reading another post and saw that someone had success with CBD so I think I will try that. I have had moderate success in the past with it.

I dont know what I'm looking for by writing this, or if anyone will even make it to this part. But I guess I just wanted to share my experience thus far. I just discovered this subreddit and, until now, I didn't have any way to relate to how I am feeling. I generally do not post at all about anything, but I am stepping out of my comfort zones in hopes that this helps me...or even anyone else for that matter. I am happy knowing that there is a place where I can relate to others on this road to recovery. I am leaving giant holes in my story but will fill in any gaps if anyone is interested enough. It's a long road ahead of me, but I just need to keep being patient with myself and remember to live in the present. Thank you for listening to my story.

I've just come home from my weekly meeting, and I'm feeling so lost.
We read step one from the green and gold tonight, I chose the reading myself. I'm three years clean and I haven't worked step one, or two, or three, or... you get the picture. 
Partly my problems with working the program have come from the lack of recovery community in my area, it's one small meeting a week and I'm almost the only woman, no ladies with more clean time than me to ask to sponsor me...
But mostly my problem has been a lack of commitment to what I know I should be doing I suppose.
I'm three years clean and I'm scared. I'm thinking about using. My addiction is rearing it's head in other areas and I can see that my relationship with food right now is mirroring how my relationship with drugs used to be. I'm trying to control my feelings and unmanageability with restricting food or overeating. 
And I can't share. I can't talk to my friends in the fellowship. I realised toight I have never really honestly shared and spoken about myself or my feelings.
I'm so scared and I feel like I'm falling. 
I realise this probably isn't the right forum for what is probably just a meaningless rant, but I wanted to talk to someone tonight, and I just couldn't open my mouth in the meeting, I hopes it's ok that I came here.

"this day in 1989
on April 10 1989 I came to feeling as miserable as I had ever felt.
I had been to treatment a couple months before and had stopped using drugs. I had been going to my meetings, but I had been vainly trying to drink between meetings thinking ""I know I cant take drugs, but surely I can drink with control"". 

I remembered my intentions of the night before to drink one rum and coke and get a nice buzz and stop. But a half a fifth of bicardi 151 later and sick and miserable I realized I had no more control with alcohol than I did with narcotics.

I did something that I had never done before in my 24 years of life.

I got down on my knees and prayed. I asked God as I then understood him to keep me clean and sober for that day. 

I have been drug and alcohol free since that day. It has not always been easy, but life has been better by far than it was back then.

I have been allowed to experience something somewhat rare. I have now been in recovery for more than half my life at 48 years old. I have been in recovery and clean and sober for twice as long as I used drugs and alcohol.

All by Gods grace the principles, steps and fellowship of the program.",

"AA works, if you work it!
I have not seen a lot of new posts on here so I decided to make one just to see something new. 

I guess I'll share a little about my story and recovery.

I am 21 years old and started my sobriety almost 6 months ago (March 20th I will have 6 months), and this time has been the best time of my life. AA has given me new real friends, the ability to be useful in the lives of others (I have a commitment at my home group) and a sense of belonging for the first time in my life.

Ever since I can remember, I have felt different from everyone around me and always sought to fit in.  When I found alcohol and drugs at the age of 14, i thought I found acceptance and had the ""i had arrived"" moment many members talk about.  I was never a ""normal drinker,"" I drank for the effect and always drank to become drunk.  I did this until I was 20 years old (a short, but destructive career) and found my own bottom. I lost enough in my life to make the decision to surrender myself to AA and allow them to show me how to stop my drinking and work on my thinking.

Today, I am in a completely different place I was when I was still out running. Today, I am happy, joyous and free from the shackles of alcohol and drugs. I live one day at a time, call/work with my sponsor, go to meetings (and even lead one), makes calls to my network of young guys, and try to be a better person then I was the day before.  I look forward to growing in the light of my Higher Power and doing what I am suppose to do, not what I want to do.

Thanks for reading, sorry if it was choppy  ",
"Forgot to write this saturday was 3 years clean for me :D
I had been sober from 16 to 22, then I relapsed and were drunk from 22-23 and during my relapse I also abused pills, anti-anxiety, anti-depressants and also sleeping pills.
So december 15th, 3 years ago, to get rid of the pain, I overdosed on a loooot of pills together with about a half a liter of vodka or so, I woke up about 2 days later covered in vomit, so I guess I didn't choke on it.
And well, from that day on I've been sober again, first time I was sober I did it on my own and this time I took help from my local addiction clinic.

I had been treated for depression since I was 18, but it was just 1 year ago I was actually diagnosed with bipolar and have the correct medication.
So I think this time will be different. 1 year to go, then I'm on a record spree.

Hope I inspired someone. :)",

"A feeling only addicts can know...
I'm on vacation, and visited my first home group ever today.  I haven't been in the area for about 6 years.  As I walked into the meeting (which was in a new venue), I ran into a buddy that I met in my first meeting ever.  He's celebrating 27 years next week, and I celebrated 11 years in May.  We chatted, and looked around the room together...

There were maybe 3 or 4 people that were in that group of about 40 that were there when we both attended meetings together every day.  There was only one other guy in the room that was there when I got clean.

If you don't remember anything else about your fellowship or Recovery in general, remember this:  It's not a social club.  It's not a way to meet people simply to make friends.  IT'S ABOUT SAVING YOUR LIFE one day at a time.  The disease of addiction kills... and sometimes we're lucky enough for it to only be actual bodily death.  For many of us, our spirit was dead for a long time before we made our first meeting.  I don't ever want to be back in that spot again.  So I remember.  I remember tht I'm allowed to fuck up in recovery.  I remember that there's ONLY ONE THING I HAVE TO DO PERFECTLY, and that is to accept, balls to bones, that I am an addict.  That first part of the first step, the acceptance that I am an addict and knowing what that means.

When you stay in recovery long enough, you will see people die.  Some simply from age.  Some from misfortune.  Some from relapse.

And some simply disappear.

So, in that moment, my old friend and I looked at each other and were thankful.  Thankful that we had been beaten down enough to be willing to do whatever it took to not pick up again.

It was a powerful feeling.",
"Ninety-two days sober, made conscious contact with my higher power before I did my third step, have had the obsession gratefully removed, and just punched my fourth step in the face in two days. 
Just wanted to share that. 

I actually had a day that, in the past, would have driven me to drink or use as well as flip the fuck out, but the thought to drink didn't even cross my mind until I realized I didn't even need/ want to well after the hectic shit had passed. 

The day was like some kind of hurdle relay: I had one thing work-related come up and I'd start stressing and figuratively hit my knees, and the stress left me. Then something else came up, started stressing a minute, pray, gone. Then ex-wife stress, rinse,repeat. Something else, same deal. 

I was being tested like a motherfucker today, and I have been given the tools to beat that shit. 

Thirty-four days of program and I really am living a life beyond my wildest dreams and I know this is nothing. 

Something else I'd like to share: 
I've been a very codependent person and have been a serial monogamist. Last night it dawned on me, and I don't know when the change happened, but I realized that I want a little goofball sponsee more than I want a girlfriend. That is an amazing place to be for me.

"Celebrated ONE YEAR CLEAN yesterday, and cried like a baby. Has anyone else gotten super emotional when getting to milestone?
Just discovered this subreddit thanks to my bf who is also in recovery. Love the stuff I have read so far!

Yesterday marked one whole year from my clean date. (I can still hardly believe it.) Went to a noon meeting to celebrate, and after getting my lovely glow-in-the-dark keychain and hug, and introduce myself, I slowly dissolved into a crying mess. I had already been congratulated by several people close to me, which made me happy, but I don't think the full reality of what I had accomplished hit me until that moment. It's so weird because certain time periods really dragged on for me. For example, I'm pretty sure the time period when I had four months clean actually occurred over a two and a half year period. Overall, I feel like that whole year went so quick!

"IT DOES WORK....I am living proof.
Hey everyone my name is randomlurker82 and I am an addict.

You know what though? I am an addict with 5 years clean. 5 years ago today, right around this time, I was taking my first shower in a month, at a detox in the south end of Boston, where I had been lucky enough to get a no-insurance bed in the dead of fuckin winter. I was tired, cold, filthy, dopesick, and had hit the bottom. I was 23 years old and it was my 3rd time going to detox. I was only going because my SO had gotten locked up the previous morning and I had promised him if he ever got locked up again I would go into treatment and wait for him so he would know where I was and so I could get an apartment and job so we would be able to be stable when he got out of jail. (I know, what a deal...he wanted all the benefits while I got all the work.) 

Anyhow, I went from that detox, to a holding, to a halfway house in a city I had never laid eyes on. I thought I was only going to be there for a few months. 5 years later I am still here. I have a job, a place to live, a great network (albeit a small one), and I am totally overwhelmed. This was my first try living the program and it works. I went from a 23 year old gutter junkie, to where I am now. 

If you are at any point of your recovery and are afraid its not for you, please, JUST KEEP COMING. ",
"Coming up on 9 months sober and still feel so purposeless. I feel myself slipping.
Sometimes I question what is it that I constantly desire escape from. Coming up on 9 months of sobriety, I'm still battling with my addictive personality. Relentlessly seeking out and exploiting any external thing I can derive even a modicum of pleasure from. Whether it's my newfound girlfriend, video games, incessant listening of music, food, pornography, sports, sex, etc. all of it provides a distraction. A means of temporarily alleviating some sense of discontentment within my life. Albeit substances have now been eliminated as a source of escapism, the familiar thought patterns and behaviors still persist. 

8 and a half months, I got expelled from school. 4 months of sobriety vanished within an instant as soon as an acquaintance offered to smoke a joint on school grounds. The same day, I was asked to leave the school and within 10 days was back in rehab. Since then, I diligently worked a 12 step program and managed to obtain some sense of stability in my life. I now live in Singapore and study psychology in a private uni, the equivalent of a community college. 

The last month and a half, I began slipping. Not in the sense of relapsing but small and not-so-small cracks in my program. When I first got out of rehab, I took the ""rigorous honesty"" aspect of the program to heart. I refrained from saying anything that can remotely be considered a lie and in the odd times I caught myself saying something that wasn't true, I possessed the integrity to admit it. Nowadays, my dishonesty has become much more predominant in my life. Here's a list of things I've recently lied about:

-Told my sponsor I had stomach problems to avoid going to my home group meeting
-Lied to my sponsor about making a certain amount of calls to other people in the program
-When asked how many girls I've been with by my gf, I lied by stating a significantly higher number to seem more experienced and fit the cocky/charming persona I've adopted around her
-When telling people stories, I'd recite something relevant I read off Reddit but pawn it off it as personal experiences
-I'd lie about how much time I spent playing video games 
-Lied to my parents about my recent exam scores, saying I got 2 As and a C when in fact I got 2 Cs and an A. 

There's plenty more that loom below the surface at the moment but that should suffice. Just pondering some of these lead me to believe I have the same tendencies of a pathological liar but majority of these lies are made out of fear. Fear of repercussions, fear of judgement, fear of losing something that I value. 

Over the past month and a half, I've been a horrible student. During many of the lectures, I'd be on my phone, hardly paying any attention. I'd take excessively long smoke breaks and miss out on a huge portion of the class and sometimes just blatantly leave the room. I procrastinate the fuck out of doing my work and most of my assignments were embarked on last minute. I'd hang out with my girlfriend up until 4 am, knowing I had a class at 8:30. 

This brings me to the next topic, which is my recently acquired need for female attention. Since arriving to Singapore, I've gradually developed a proclivity to pursue an abundance of romantic interest in my life. In the first week I've arrived to Singapore, I hooked up with a girl from my class. I became slightly attached to her but because our intentions didn't align, we went our separate ways although the craving for affection persisted. This unsatisfied yearning drove me to download tinder and since then, I've become involved with 3 girls', one of whom I'm currently dating. I see her on a daily basis and it's not as sex fueled as one might think. Her parents are home most of the time which makes sex a pretty uncommon occurrence. I'm reluctant to say it's lust that drives me to do this but it definitely does play a role in it. I speculate that it's the need for affirmation that fuels this behavior, to derive some sense of worth from the affection these girls provide me with. Shows to say just how low my self esteem is to this day. 

I'm not particularly sure where this is going to be honest. What I'm trying to say is that although my life seems to be on track and is a hell of a lot better compared to what it was like a year prior, I still feel restless, irritable and discontent when left with my own thoughts. Each day, I try my hardest to keep myself occupied. Reading Reddit, listening to music, playing video games, working out, playing sports whatever it is that keeps my mind busy. But once I stop for a minute and just think, I feel that sense of desolation looming within me. That sense of gloom and distress constantly gnawing at me. I try to keep it at bay but it never fully goes away. I still feel so directionless. My life still lacks purpose. Although I go to 4 meetings a week, chair one of them, work as a secretary for another, keep in contact with multiple people in recovery everyday, and am currently in the process of obtaining my degree, I still have no clue where I'm headed in life. Just like during my using days, I still live life on a day to day basis. Nothing planned ahead, no ideas concerning where I'm going, what career path I'm planning to choose, what I'll do once my course ends, nothing at all. I can't even think of what I'll be doing a year from now. All I can hope for is that I'm sober because I've had enough of that life already. I turn 18 in the following month and I still can't fully comprehend what it's going to be like being an adult. I just feel so lost at the moment and I don't know how else to express this. I really have no clue where I was going with this rant but I felt like I had to write it out and articulate the negative emotions I've been repressing for a while now. Thanks to whoever read this.

"I'm approaching two years sober and it's blowing my mind.
This might be a lengthy post so bear with me. I was incredibly young when I got addicted, I made a post 11 months ago titled 'nearly one year sober' and it just hit me that I'm approaching two years without speed. I look back at the night that I quit for the first time and how awful I was. I had lost 50 pounds in three months, I drank rockstars and monsters like water, and did so many things that I am utterly ashamed of: lying to friends and family, stealing, amongst other things. Being sober forces you to think about those things and that's one the biggest challenges I've had thus far. 

Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I think about it and it just eats me up inside, but the pride and contentment I feel now that I am able to see I am no longer that person and creating that separation in my mind is what inspires me every day to not make that call or buy that pipe. My addiction was a secret, so I handled 90% of my recovery on here and with the one friend I trusted telling everything to. I'm close to shedding a tear thinking about the changes I've made my life, even before my addiction I never thought I'd be alive this long. 

I woke up a few days ago and felt a craving I haven't in a long time after having a bad night, and I was so close to calling someone and picking up. I was shaking it was so bad, but I didn't. And as I was scrolling through my old posts I realized how close I am to two years and it made me so happy to not have made that call. You guys have been such an amazing support group for me, and I am beyond grateful to have such a wonderful community to talk to when things get rough.  I can only hope I've been there for someone else like you guys have been there for me. 

I don't want to make this post to seem braggy, but rather as a reminder that even if you're five minutes sober, that's your first step. It's going to fucking suck. You're going to feel awful, and depressed. But it ends, it ends. It gets easier. I never thought I'd escape it, but I swear to you guys it's possible. 

I'm not done recovering, I probably never will be. But the acceptance that each day I live is one day further away from my addiction is something that I treasure. I guess I just want to say thank you, for everything. If you ever need someone to talk you, never hesitate to message me. 

TL;DR I'm almost two years sober and so grateful for the support I've received on Reddit. Thank you. ",
"100 Days
100 days. 100 fucking days sober from cocaine. I never thought I ever make it this far but I made it. It’s been a real fucking rollercoaster, I’ve had a lot of bad days, in fact most of that time I was miserable but I kept going - but it’s starting to get better; the cravings are subsiding and my mindset has begun to change - whenever I’m feeling shit I’ve noticed my first response is not to go to drugs anymore.

I still have a long way to go but in this time sober I have made incredible changes to the point I am almost a different person than the one I was before, I’ve been going to the gym consistently 6 times a week with a very clean diet and I really enjoy making gains haha - it’s the one thing I love doing now and that keeps me going. Im still learning how to enjoy life in other aspects - I have begun socialising a little more, just having 5 minute conversations with people. I used to use cocaine a lot to socialise so this has been a challenge for me but I’m getting there - I don’t feel ready to go out partying in clubs or anything sober without the risk of using yet.

Yeah just wanted to share my progress and if anyone out there is doubting themselves, if I can do it, so can you.

Here’s to another fucking 100 days!",

"I am new here and want to say hello!
Goodmorning fellow recovery folk. I have been reading this Reddit for a few days now and wanted to introduce myself. 

My name is Sam and I am 5 months and 8 days clean and sober. I am a recovering heroin addict, but have battled with almost everything under the sun. One thing I feel that lacks in my recovery is a solid support group. I turned to the internet this last week and found this forum. It is amazing to see so many people online supporting each other during recovery. I look forward to being an active member of this community.

Many thanks, sincerely,
Sam.",

hi! coming up on 70 days sober from xanax, adderall, weed, alcohol and cigarettes (lol). i'm a 22 y/o female and have not been sober for more than a day here and there since I was 12. from 12-20 I had a crippling adderall addiction and after it was taken away from me, I went into a crippling benzo addiction, decided to quit cold turkey because it was ruining everything (mostly my bank account and career) idk....just wanted somewhere to talk about this, thanks for listening y'all.",
"My cousin died last night.
I'll preface this with: I'm not much of a typist, but I used my phone so it would autocorrect. Tommy had autocapitalize and autocorrect off and I can't bare to look at his phone anymore.

Some of you might have known him. /u/number3boys (now deleted) was my cousin. He was a cocaine addict for 20 years, a survivor of sexual assault as the hands of my father, his father and mother, his sisters, and later on, patients and staff in the psychiatric ward he lived in. He was frequent on here, /r/cocaine, and some other places I shouldn't mention.

Tommy was 37. Tomorrow he would have been 38. He snorted a fatal amount of cocaine mixed with heroin and fentanyl, which is unusual as he only ever snorted cocaine. I told his young daughters and half sister this morning.

Tommy was more like my brother. He was my best friend. He was a child at heart and the sweetest guy you could imagine. He was severely bipolar and didn't work, so I supported him after his mother died. I love him. He was just so sweet, like a little kid. He loved everyone.

He wrote in his diary about some very important people. Among the people he wanted to thank, and meet some day(!) there were two he wrote about most often.

/u/jbgreen - he describes you as awesome, snarky and someone who knew cocaine like he did. He says that he would love to ""do some rails with this guy"". The highest compliment from my cousin you can get.

/u/emoamy271 - we talked. He loved you very much and found your stuffed animals adorable. He had much to say about how you were always there for him and he appreciated that so much. Tommy loves you so much!

I wanted to let his friends (whichever he didn't include in his book) know where he was if he didn't come around anymore . Thank you for helping him through his bests and worsts. Sorry to damper the day.",
"I passed my exam!
I am absolutely over the moon excited about it, and I just have to tell somebody! 

For context: I went to 5+ years of school for this area of study, but was so beaten down from an abusive boyfriend, PTSD, and a demanding professor, I didn't take it. I kept putting it off, and putting it off. I used drugs instead... And it was easy.

Then I got sober... And realized that a lot of things needed to change. I scheduled this exam roughly 4 weeks into sobriety, and was incredibly doubtful I'd still be sober when that date rolled around... Even more so about passing on the first try.

So... I'm just so happy that I wanted to share it with you.

"3 years since my last drink, little over a year since last fentanyl use, and first time completely sober
First stint in rehab was 2008, and it’s been pretty hit and miss since then. I had three years through AA but was still on Ativan and some occasional drug use. About 18 months ago I got squirmy and picked up pot as harm reduction (hadn’t smoked since 2001). Well it didn’t do what I wanted so in all my wisdom I jumped right to fentanyl. That worked, at first, then it became this god awful crutch that made me constantly sick, more overdoses than I can remember and horrible wd on a short ass half life.

My last OD was bad enough I was 5150 and two weeks in psych ward before heading to residential rehab for 2 months.

But it’s been a year, and I’m still clean....and happy. What a concept. I don’t do AA, instead I have a mix of SMART, lifering, trauma therapist, eating disorder therapist and dbt class. If you’re like me, drinking/UAing was hell but thinking my only other option being AA was not much better...I hope you know you do have a choice. Make your recovery your own, and make it sustainable.

"I'm 5 years clean and want to help
I've never done anything like this. My name is Mike and I'm an addict. Aside from addiction I also have major depression and moderate anxiety. I don't like recording myself or putting myself out there when I don't have to but I've made a video because I needed to say what I wanted to write to a lot of people on here. I thought about it and it took me a week to finally talk myself into making a short video. I'm an introvert to the fullest, I like to read and play video games, go on reddit, never comment, all that lame shit. Not start youtube channels. So this is a bit left field for me.

Like the title says, I'm 5 years clean. My drug of choice was heroin. I'm 28 years old now. I live in Chicago. I went back to college 2 years ago. I just wanted to say that recovery is possible! I see a lot of strong people on this sub. It takes strength to put your pain and your fear out there for everyone to see and read. You are not the only one and more importantly you are not alone! 

I hope this doesn't get classified as spam. I'm not a social marketer. I'm just an addict making a video response regarding recovery. However, I would like the channel to one day be a place you can visit when you have questions or comments whether it be for me or another member of the community concerning sobriety. I literally just started this thing today, so there's only one video (I plan to update daily), right now, it's more of an idea than anything but I have a vision maybe it can grow into something that can help other people who are suffering from substance abuse, give people like us a place online where we can get together, introverts unite! The path of recovery does not always have to be traveled alone, though it may feel like that the majority of the time. Reaching out is everything. This is me reaching out, I guess.

"We are a Vision of Hope - 8 Years!!!
Hi all,

I just wanted to share the joy that I have today. 

8 years ago today, I tried to kill myself by taking my dad's heart medication. I had gotten a DUI and I couldn't get clean. I believed that my life was just going to be more pain and misery, so I figured why would I put myself through that. I was 20 years old, but I felt like I was an old man. I ended up being found by my parents and ran away. I was throwing up black blood. I somehow survived and ended up going to rehab. There I was introduced to Narcotics Anonymous. I didn't have a basic text, so I stole it from the facility. 

My life has changed an immense amount in 8 years. I lived in a recovery house for 2 years, I moved out of there, I went back to school, finished school, reunited with my family, and am in the healthiest relationship I've ever been in. The biggest difference is how I feel about myself. I can laugh, forgive, and even love myself today. I attribute this directly from continuing to work steps, be of service, sponsor others, and apply spiritual principles to my daily life. Any addict, even a 20 year old agnostic, can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live.

One of the most amazing experiences comes from this subreddit. I saw one of the many postings on here of someone struggling and reaching out for help. I ended up messaging that person. Turns out, his old sponsor was one of my best friends. I just saw him the other week at a meeting and he looked happy, joyous, and free. This subreddit is an amazing opportunity to help reach those people who might be too nervous to hit a meeting yet. I try to stay away from definitions about my higher power, but I know my higher power puts me in places where I can see beauty, growth, and compassion. 

Thank you, Narcotics Anonymous, for giving me a life worth living.",

Either way, I will chair the meeting and like all other things in life, repeated behavior becomes easier and then 2nd nature. 
I am not super excited, not super nervous. something I try to maintain at all times. I think what I'm doing is blotting out any excitement or fear as I know those two emotions tend to breed trouble. 
It will force me to show up that's for sure.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post is, I just wanted to talk. 





**TL:DR alcohol will fuck you up, and you won't realize it until its too late.**






I like most of us if were honest started with my 1st drink when I was 4. 1979. It was a Coors that my dad had me taste with his buddies. It was mostly foam, I still remember the taste vividly. My second drink was when I was 13. New Years eve of '88. It was a glass airline bottle of Old Crow. Me and my friends took it off my folks nick-nak shelf. I remember everything about it. I remember the metal ring around the glass from the removing of the cap, I remember my lips feeling the grooves of the threading on the glass, and I remember it tasted like, wet dust. But something happened after that initial belt from the shock of the taste. I felt a glow in my gut. everything became ""ok"". I remember thinking...I'm gonna remember this moment for the rest of my life! Me and my 3 friends, walking in the dusk toward the next romp. I remember the stars twinkled brighter, the streets asphalt was cleaner and the green of the grass penetrating deeper into my eyes than before. Everything was interesting in a good way. I of course being the cool guy at 13 I was...I kept these thoughts to myself.

The next time I drank was about 2 months later, in the dead of winter, we had broken into a neighbors house and raided her liquor cabinet. this was a small country town, and no one locked their doors back then, we caused no harm, just a couple of kids looking for a kick. We got a mason jar and mixed rum, vodka, brandy and wine all together. We got black out drunk. it was near my 14th birthday. so I have been a black out drunk since I was 14. Needless to say we were horribly hungover. and I never touched alcohol again with the goal of getting drunk till my 21st birthday.

It was 1995 in southeastern Michigan, and for the next 15 years I would get by with my youth, environment or friends as an excuse for why I couldn't stop drinking. I was in college I was supposed to drink! Most of you can already guess where this is going, I stopped maturing, Had several great ladies who truly loved me and couldn't understand my behavior, countless relapses, unpaid bills deep remorse and occasional nights in jail. 

It wasn't until I woke up in a jail cell and the judge had told me my charges, I was looking at 20 years. No criminal record, just a DUI in 98. I didn't get into trouble when I drank, but every time I was in trouble, booze was involved. But what I was facing was a million-fold past even my worst nightmare. I beat the case, and by beat the case, I only went to jail for 10 months, and not for 20 years. When I was in jail there were to many to count who had caused unbelievable tragedy from their boozing. All were sent to prison for multiples of years, some ten or more, and I had to witness there grief and fear and sorrow every step of the way.

But there was one man, he got 22 years. He had a 6 pack, floored it though a yellow light, and killed a mother while her two small children survived. He was my cellmate, and I'd pretend to be sleeping when he wept late at night, or awoke screaming from a nightmare of seeing the children's faces. He took a plea deal of 22 years, if he had lost trial, he would have got 45 years. 

305 days of terrible tragedy after terrible tragedy, or worse yet, seeing those who didn't take there situation seriously, nearly guaranteeing a lengthy prison sentence in their future. I could never wake up, or at least go somewhere to avoid these cases of misery. Daily I was reminded of how lucky I was, how terrible it could have been for me, and how our egos blind us to reality.

Some reading this may think ""there is no way that would happen to me"". Well, I thought so too, just keep drinking and time will eventually get you.

Thats all I've got. Thanks for making it to the end.

"Finally Going To Rehab After 18 Years
Hey as the title says I am finally going to rehab. This is a 12 week total abstinence program. I live in the UK so unlike a lot of the American stories I have been reading. I will be getting this help for free, and should probably have taken it a long time ago.

I'm now 33, I smoked weed from the age of 13, then at 14/15 tried my first valium tablet, which made me feel on top of the world. Then by the time it was my 16th birthday I was taking ecstacy/cocaine then Heroin quite regularly.

I suppose it became a real problem when I was 17/18 when I dropped the uppers completely and was taking heroin every  day. Since then I have always tried to convince myself that  I was strong enough to sort this out myself by going on several different prescriptions. Methadone/Diffs and the most recent one Suboxone, which I have been on for the last 5 years. 

However the last 3 years I have been hitting crack/heroin a lot and finally decided it is time to sort this out once and for all, I haven't used anything apart from my Suboxone prescription for the last 2 weeks and I am starting to feel like myself slightly again. I will be going to a detox facility for 2 weeks in around a month to get of the suboxone, then switched right over in to the 12 week abstinence program at their facility.

I think I was scared to tell let everyone know I'd fucked up once again, and used the excuse of my childs mother (whom I don't live with) finding out. However I have now told everyone and to my surprise they have all been very supportive and are glad that I am doing this.

I suppose I am writing this just to hear from others who have went through something similar? I think the questions that are banging my head the most are, how did you feel on the day you were released from rehab? Did you feel like you fitted right back in with society or was this more a gradual thing after rehab?

Also sleep, thats a big one. How long did it take you to get a decent, or even semi decent nights sleep after being clean. Having been a functioning addict who has always held down a job. I am re located out of my town once I leave the facility, and although there is 2 years after care offered, I plan on getting a job and getting right back to work. I need to keep my mind busy.",

"9 years ago...
I was planning a night of debauchery with some friends from out of town. I had gathered all the usual suspects, E, coke, booze, the things I needed to feel good while I was in the midst of a crippling benzo addiction. I had been strung out on pills for a full year, the capstone to 20 years of near daily pot and alcohol use; with weekend hard drug benders regularly scheduled. I went to take a nap, so I could stay up later, and when I woke up, my living room was full of people. My first thought was “I didn’t buy enough e for all these people!” My second thought was “oh shit, this is my intervention!” I literally fell on the ground laughing,  because I didn’t have a problem! I was just sick, and I needed my Xanax and Ativan to just function and I needed my coke to stay awake. Eventually I agreed to go to rehab. The first three days were a nightmare, like something from a Clive Barker book or that old movie Jacob’s Ladder. Around day 4, I had a moment of clarity and accepted that I was powerless of drugs and  the obsession to use was lifted, and it never returned. I went to a meeting every day for a year, then I went 5 times a week for the next two. I don’t go to a lot of meetings these days, but I keep in touch, and when life gets me down I know where to go.

If it worked for me, it can work for you.",
"Does the shame of a relapse ever go away? Will I ever feel successful with my clean time again?
I had 3 years and 8 months clean and decided to use for one day. I came back in the rooms the next day and was able to get almost a year clean before I decided to use for another day. I just got back from a convention where I didn't stand up during the clean time count down because there is so much shame that I only have 100-something days instead of the five years I ""should"" have.  Picking up key tags has been terribly painful and a shaming experience. I just want it to feel successful to get a key tag like it felt when I first got clean. I want the hugs I get when I get a key tag to feel like an ""I'm proud of you"" hug instead of like a ""pity"" hug. 

After my first relapse I never felt the shame go away, so I don't think I can expect it to this time either. Even if I ever get a four year medallion, more consecutive clean time than I've ever had, I feel like I'll still have in the back of my head ""I 'should' have almost 9 years right now""

I just wanted to know if it ever went away for others who have relapsed, or is there anything practical I can do to fix my distorted perspective",

Hey guys,

"Still battling heroin after 8 years sobriety.
I've never done anything like this. I'm terrified to do so, but I need to and I hope someone can get something from my experiences, so here goes:

I'm a 30 year old from the Midwest. I am a husband to a beautiful wife and father of two beautiful girls. I am halfway though a PhD in theoretical physics. I live a stable life with much love in my. When I write all this down, everything seems very well. But lately, the demons have returned full force.

My addiction story starts 10 years ago where I was in college. I was very bored and depressed. And like many 20 year olds, I enjoyed drinking heavily and getting stoned. It was all good. But the party life began to get dull after a few years and began to experience a desire for more to calm my anxious mind. I don't honestly remember how it happened, but 30 mg of oxycontin fell into my hand and it was exactly what I needed to soothe my mind. Soon, more found it's way to me. So the more I did. Soon I realized it was happening most days and it had an effect on my day-to-day life. My roommate at the time was prescribed Adderall, and he hated it. So he gave it to me. I was strung out for a long time and it didn't seem to worry me.

This went on for quite some time. Fast forward to when I was 22. I was running into some minor financial issues due to trying to pay for this expensive addiction. At that point, I didn't see this as a big enough problem to quit my habit, so I learned of a friend of a friend who had some heroin. Then I learned that it was very cheap comparatively. So naturally, my addict mind decided that was a good idea. So then I began the dark path down that road. 

After a few months of this, my life really started feeling like it was falling apart. I no longer cared about anything except my addiction. I woke up on the floor of my basement after a night of particular heavy use. I cried and cried for a long time, because that's what it took for me to realize what my life had become. I decided what I needed to do was pack my things and move back home to get clean. So I spoke with my parents, spoke with my roommates. My parents gave me the money to pay my share for the remaining three months of our lease and I moved back. I withdrew in the care of my accepting parents. I began my life again.

So I stayed clean. I got a job. When I was comfortable, I got my own apartment again. Lived life as a relatively functional adult. I met who would become my wife. We fell in love. We had an accidental child who we love. She convinced me to go back to school and get my degree. So I did that. Then I realized I wanted a PhD, so I was accepted into grad school.

Throughout all those good things, every so often, the demons would come back out and tell me it wouldn't be bad to just try heroin again. I always resisted, if not for me, but for my wife and kids. My wife knows the whole story and is very supportive. Thank god.

For the last two months, I have had these desires like I've never had before. Granted a PhD in physics can be very stressful, especially with two kids. I find I think about heroin a lot. And about how good it felt. And how little cares and anxiety I actually had. Last night and today were the worst. My wife was at work and I was at home with the kids. All I wanted was to find some and forget about everything. Thankfully, I resisted. I hadn't been telling my wife about these feelings because I didn't want her to worry more. I spoke with her and as always, she was supportive and there for me. 

I absolutely do not want to go back to my old lifestyle. I don't think I would survive. I have so much going on. I know I will carry these addiction demons with me for the rest of my life, but the best I can do is tell them to go back to Hell. I am lucky that I am where I am. 

There's my story. I hope someone can relate and maybe can just be ok knowing that we are not alone. Even after 8 years sobriety, I still struggle and I will continue to do so. So let's all support each other!",
"I did it! Off Valium/Suboxone after 3 month taper
Really pleased to have the support of people in NA as I'd never have gotten this far without relapse

"my first meeting
ive posted here a few times when i was struggling. i did use many times in betweent hose posts and tried quitting again.

every time i post i get the same responses which is get my fucking ass to a meeting and i always ignored them. i did other things like go to a therapist or scare the shit out of my family with how i was feeling.
my last post aside from the people telling me to get off my ass and go i also got a private from someone who sounded like me and just told me how much it really does help. i finally decided to take what everyone was telling me seriously and made it to my first meeting last night.

i think it was the best choice i made, yes i was nervous during before and after but the people were great. they way they treated me as a newcomer was amazing and i honestly felt loved, i heard few people tell stories and one guy sounded exactly like me and it almost made me cry.
but first off. thank you to everyone who kept saying go to a meeting. it was the best thing i think i could have done and i plan on continuing to go a few times a week. not only for me but for the people there as well. i mean i liked who i met and they cared how i was. i think i did make the right choice in going.",
"Here to help. 22f, 3.5 years clean/sober.
I got ""forced"" by my loving parents into rehab at the fresh age of 19. I was having the time of my life: I was in my dream college, active in my sorority, and oh yeah- absolutely dead inside. 

But thanks to them- I am alive today and I am so much happier. Giving up my location (moving/withdrawing from college temporarily), friends (I had to cut ties with friends who I only would use with), and anything else that was only associated with my addiction was the hardest thing I could have ever done and such a huge sacrifice, but the GIFTS sobriety and recovery have given me have been worth it. I went from going to a good college to going to one of the top 5 business colleges and then securing a job with one of the top three worldwide tech companies. And that's just career! In personal life I found my soulmate and have two puppies.

LIFE IS SO GOOD SOBER. The promises come true with time.

But the reason for this post is not to tell my story, although I felt necessary to establish myself before offering a listening ear or maybe any advice. Staying clean young is hard (staying clean at all is hard!! But add on a 21st birthday and all your friends binge drinking? It's tough.) - I can tell you what I've done and possibly help. 

I also grew up in an alcoholic household, so I have the ""relative of an addict"" viewpoint too! Lol. I can help with that as well.



YOU CAN DO THIS.

I got clean young and I have 3+ years in recovery. I want to help any way I can - offering advice/telling what I did, listen, etc. I also was raised in alcoholic household, so I can help with that too! ",
"Kratom is just as bad as opiates. Don't let your mind fool you.
Long story short I have been an addict for a while. I was using opiates and my fiance found out which led to huge issues in our relationship. We got through it after a lot of hard conversations.

I didn't want to get on suboxone so I started taking Kratom to ease the withdrawls. I'm sure you can all see where this is going; I just traded one addiction for another.

I kept taking Kratom even though I told her I stopped. She found out last night and now I don't think I am engaged anymore. She smashed her engagement ring with a hammer...

I've lost the most important thing in my life. I feel like a shell of who I was before. 

I've been sober for about 26 hours. I'm at work and I cannot focus, cannot think about anything except how many times I have ruined my life. It took me a long time but I've bounced back from all of it... except for this. I dont think there is any coming back from this.

I just keep hearing what she said to me last night again and again. ""I fucking hate you. You don't love me. You're a worthless piece of shit."" I'm not sure what makes me more sad; the fact that those things are coming out of her mouth or the fact that I agree with her.

I hate myself. I destroy everyone's lives. I wish I was dead.",
"750 days, today...
Don't leave before the miracle happens. I'm a 23 year old recovering drug addict, but I've lived free of opiates, benzodiazepines and alcohol for 750 beautiful days... This freedom is something I could never have fathomed from my spot on the rocks in active addiction.

For me, acceptance was the answer. I had to give up the hope of a better past before I could bear living in the day - now there's no place I'd rather be.

I fucked up I was sober for eight months.  I started drinking very lightly and everything seemed fine.  My boyfriend and me went to a bar with his friend and got really drunk and ended up doing some coke. I woke up the next morning and didn't remember but my boyfriend told me. I said it was whatever and we went to clean out the car and find a bag of heroin that his friend dropped and decided to smoke it. My boyfriend and me decided fuck it and shot it up. He did me first and gave me way too much and my face turned all blue. He got scared and drove me to the ER and on the way I died. I was dead for 15 minutes. I feel like shit now but I'm fine. I'm freaking out through. I can't even wrap my brain around the fact that I was dead for 15 minutes. 
Also sidebar my little sister overdosed and died a year ago. So I'm also coping with the fact that I can't understand why she would die and a fuck up like me is still walking around.  ",
"14 Years Ago, on this very day.
I woke up destroyed.
The day after my birthday, several hours from the night before gone from my memory like they didn't exist.

14 years ago, on this very day.
I realized I was beat.  I realized I was playing a game with my life on the line that was rigged.  With the rules as they were that day, I would never 'win', only lose, again and again.

14 years ago, on this very day.
I asked for real help.
Not the kind of help that we ask for in times of distress of our own creation 'Get me out of this and I will do better' but real help.  

14 years ago, on this very day.
I started a new life.  
One that has exceeded any expectation I had that day (I still work on setting expectations, even today, but it is progress, not perfection).  Every day has not been a walk in the roses.  The last 14 years, lived in increments of 24 hours, there have been many challenges.  That said, with a lot of help and support, I have gotten through all of them.  Not just gotten through these challenges, but have tried to do it in a healthy way.

I have personally heard from many folks that have gone back out after double digit recovery that they have had too many years and not enough days.  Even though today, I celebrate 14 years, I still am grateful every morning when I get up that I am sober.  I still remember that fateful day when I woke up and surrendered.  I still know that no matter what job I have, how many people love me in my life or how much money is in my account that even after 14 years I am still vulnerable to my Scumbag Alcoholic/Addict brain.

14 years ago, on this very day.
I was able to reboot my life. 
I cannot take any credit for this, if it were completely up to me, I would have mucked it up. The friends/sponsors/sponsees/family that I have relied on over this time deserve the credit.  The HP of my understanding deserves the credit.  I am a happy passenger, filled with gratitude, trusting that life will work out just the way it is supposed to.

If things are bad, they will get better.  If things are awesome, they will probably not stay awesome forever.  No matter what though, things will work out just the way they are supposed to, only if I don't get in the way and try to make them do one thing or another.",
"Our disease is still alive !
For all of you out there who wonder ' am I still under attack from my disease  ? I've got xx amount of time maybe I can take a drink.  ' or whatever it is that we think ( yes WE ALL think this  members with doubles digit years do as well they have told me ). This shit is still out there. 

My sponsors brother committed suicide two nights ago. He was drunk coupled with depression. He decided to take his own life. Maybe he thought there was no way out. Who knows what he was thinking. 

Just remember if you are new to recovery or shit if you have ten years and are feeling stuck.

 There is a way out. 

One day at a time. 

We never HAVE to use again. 

Please go to a meeting and tell someone how you are feeling.

"Reddit, today is the day I stop.
I am 24 years old. I have been a heavy drinker since around 17-18, I was your stereotypically high school metal head that never really grew out of party mode. Last night I blacked out again, enough is enough. I am going to my first open AA meeting tonight, my girlfriend is coming for moral support (her father was a bad alcoholic and due to his priors is not even allowed in the same state anymore).

I came to the realization that I am going to hurt myself (more/again) or someone else by my drinking, and I'm not taking emotional damage. I've driven drunk, when I drink I will do any drugs, I become this other person, I steal stuff, I degrade women, I generally become an asshole if you try to stop my ""fun"". I'm already feeling a little better admitting this to strangers, granted this is over the internet, but maybe this is like practicing a speech in a mirror before the event.

I'm looking for any advice anyone can give me to take under advisement. Tips to stay on the straight and narrow. I still live with my parents and they drink, so there is booze in the house. The thing that blows my mind is alcoholism runs on both sides of the family. My dad will have maybe 2-3 beers at night, if he even does that (he typically nurses a 30 pack all week, where as I would kill it in one night), and typically my mother doesn't even drink during the week.

Edit: So I went to the meeting, though I didn't participate much I felt better after leaving. Everyone was very friendly and open. My parents have said if I want they can lock up the alcohol in the house and curb their drinking around me, I told them for now no. I think maybe if I can resist it while it's directly in front of me it might be better. My girlfriend's mother also offered to let me live with them if it is too much being around it (She has a ""dry"" house). For now I declined, I appreciate what they are trying to do for me though. And I appreciate everyone's comments and advice. I did go over to r/stopdrinking like offtherocks suggested and requested a badge, who knows maybe it will help.

I was thinking of getting something to carry with me to remind me not to drink. I think after one year of AA you get a token? I was just going to get something small to carry in my pocket that every time I may want one to take it out and look at it to remind me ""No, you're better that, you can resist.""",
"I lost my cousin today. Please take your recovery seriously, everyone.
I just got a call that my Aunt and Uncle found my 20 year old cousin dead today. He and his friend both overdosed last night. From what I can gather, they got the drugs from someone else and misjudged how much to use, or what exactly they had.

I grew up with this guy. We were extremely similar down to our sense of humor, the only major difference starting around age 13 when he started slipping into a different crowd. He fell into drug use, and eventually out of high school. I started to only see him at Christmas or Thanksgiving, and his parents did everything they could to try and help him. After some time, he started to improve his situation and worked for a couple of years at the family business downtown. But he was still casually doing drugs off and on, and last night it caught up with him.

I just wanted to post this here in order to try and encourage someone out there struggling with their own addiction. Keep in mind any momentary slip, no matter how casual, can be your last or the last for someone else nearby. As horrible as I feel, I can't imagine how destroyed my cousin's parents and sister feel. Even now, my mother is on the same road, and has been for about eight years, and I worry for her as well.

Good luck to those of you fighting similar battles.",

"Found a sponsor and about to truly start my journey
I have only been to 10 meeting so far but I've been inspired by every one of them and I feel ready to fully commit. I took some good advice and chose 5 meetings I will attend every week so I make connections with people rather than shopping around for the ""perfect"" group. I may even have decided on my home group. 

I'm trying to trust my gut rather than overthinking things (overthinking got me into this predicament). I also decided I shouldn't shop around for the ""perfect"" sponsor either and take an opportunity if one arises. 

I was nervous about approaching people, but after I shared at a meeting last night (which I did even though I didn't feel like it) not only did people say they related to what I shared (even though I didn't feel like I had anything inspiring to say after hearing people share who have been sober 20+ years), but a woman approached me afterwards to ask if I wanted a sponsor. She has a lot of experience and seems very knowledgeable. I thought about it overnight and decided to go for it. I had a feeling that an opportunity would arise and if so I should take it. 

In only 10 meetings I've found the most amazing support group, I feel like I'm helping people even if my shares don't seem to me to be all that meaningful. I've also started to conquer my fear of public speaking. Just getting up in front of people and talking about such personal thing is a huge step. 

Who knows how much will change once I've gone to 100 or more meetings. For the first time in a very long time I feel hopeful, I feel like I belong, and I feel accepted. 

If anyone has any tips about starting out with a sponsor / starting the steps I'd love to hear them. Or even just any personal experiences. I'm starting out with calling my sponsor every day at the same time. 

Has anyone done 90 meetings in 90 days? I think it could be beneficial but I'm worried that if I aim too high I will feel like a failure if I don't manage it.",

"Year Two of Recovery
I just recently picked up one year earlier this month, which I am ecstatic about. However, recently, I have been struggling with my bipolar depression and anxiety. 

I was told in the rooms that year one is mostly about the recovery from active addiction and that year two is dealing with the emotions related to your addiction, which I completely agree with. 

I have been seeing character defects and emotions come up that I wasn't even aware I had. 

Has anyone else had similar issues with their second year in recovery? Would you agree? What has worked for you to get through this?",

"How I got sober (2.5 years so far)
Hey all,

I have never really told anyone except my sponsor and my girlfriend how I got sober. I go to AA mtgs but I always feel uncomfortable telling people what I did.


Anyways I started @ AA in 09, pulled about a year and then got disenchanted. Blamed AA, but it wasn't the problem - I just had some stuff I hadn't looked at that was deep inside. I took a year off (relapsed) went to college, did really well and had a blast, but ran out of money and developed a big pot problem again. Pot is my drug of choice. If I drink, I eventually start smoking weed again. and When I smoke weed, I do extremely stupid things like walk out of Fortune 500 companies and drop out of half-ride college scholarships and ruin relationships with people that I love, or could have the possibility to cultivate love with. Throughout all of this - my primary purpose was to figure out what my purpose was on this planet. I thought I had one. I always had this 'itch' after I had my first spiritual awakening (recognizing that ... there was a greater power than me in the universe) that I felt like I was chasing. I just couldn't stop chasing it. Don't know why, it just felt like I was doing myself a disservice by not chasing it. Hell - I was in my early twenties, why not?


So towards the end of this first year after stepping out of sobriety, I met a girl who looking back - was insane - but I was deep in my pot use and I thought she was perfect. Anyways she had a heroin problem, was sexually abused by her step-father and her mother would repeatedly deny it, and had frequent suicide attempts. Well she was trying to get sober and we would go to AA mtgs together and I believed it would be absolutely impossible for her to get sober from going to AA. I mean I knew she might be able to string together a few days and maybe weeks, but long term sobriety? I just didn't see it happening.


So I went to the library. I checked out all of the books on alcoholism and addiction that I could find. Buddhist recovery books, nutrition recovery, everything. I started reading. Then I finally got to this book called The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure.


After reading Chris Prentiss's son's story, and Chris Prentiss's explainations, my life changed. My life flashed before my eyes and I felt more powerful and more aware of who I was and I felt like I had finally found what I had been searching for... for literally forever. I dropped to my knees and cried my eyes out.


I felt like I knew what to do.


It took two years, dropping out of college (again) and slowly reducing my marijuana intake and changing how I approached life to get consistent sobriety. I don't smoke weed, drink, or do anything else - I do use a vape stick though, and I have been consistently cutting down on that (24mg starting to 12 mg currently, I use to smoke about a pack a day).


I started doing what I wanted to do, within the confines of my reality. My head was finally a safe space. I use to be very extroverted and out-going, and as of today I am more solitary and at peace. My social ability is returning, but I do not put emphasis on it like I use to.


Anyways that's how I got sober today. I do what I want today - within the confines of reality. Currently, I *slightly want to* but mostly have to work full time to pay off some debts I have accrued, and to feed myself and keep myself sheltered to a comfortable level. Sadly, this is a reality and necessity in my world. I am working to figure out how to reduce my work week - as free-time is something I strongly enjoy.


I am definitely timid in areas such as relationships and friendships, but I find so much peace being alone (something I never could do prior to reading the Alcoholism and Addiction Cure) that I am okay with that. I truly feel like I am making progress every day.


I attend AA mtgs regularly as I really do admire and identify with a lot of the Blue Book / Big Book ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" book literature. I don't hear much of the message in meetings and most meetings I go to I feel like are filled with people that need help, but what I do appreciate about the meetings is the authenticity and rawness of people communicating what they are experiencing in their lives. I also absolutely thrive on new-comers, hearing their story reminds me of how I use to think and how horrible it was being out there - and the sheer struggle of early sobriety. I still keep in contact with my former sponsor (who I consider to be a mentor, life-guide, teacher, and friend today) and with a few people I have developed friendships with over the years.


I would love to hear your feedback as I am being completely raw in my communication.


Thank you for reading this.",
"It’s just scary how easy it is to pick up.
I’ve been sober for 124 days. 28 of which were in rehab, so I’m still super new at this.  I’m on a mini mothers day vacation with family right now.  Everyone has fallen asleep and I’ve snuck out to the terrace for a smoke.  Sitting next to me is a glass of wine my husband didn’t finish.  On the dresser is half a bottle.  I just dumped the glass.  The bottle will sit there.  I’m not going to touch it. 

I’m fine with people drinking around me.  I think it’s important to get there.  I don’t go to bars and avoid parties, but when out to dinner, if people want to drink it doesn’t bother me.  

But….
I wish he had corked it and put it away.  My cravings have been minimal to none, but saturday night, just a glass is sounding good. I have an almost itchy antsy feeling in my chest that is saying just do it.  No big thing.  At the same time I’m fast forwarding. . .  I know one glass won’t be enough and I’ll head to the bar.  There will be hangover, major disappointment and a reset to zero days for nothing.  Worst case no one will notice and I’ll be off and running drinking on the down low until I find myself back in rehab.  

I’ll go to bed soon without drinking.  I’m doing the minute by minute thing.  Sometimes it’s so easy and I don’t even think about drinking.  Tonight will just be another hurdle that will make the next time this happens easier.  

Thanks for listening and Happy mothers day to all you moms walking this same path. ",
"How to stay in AA without it making you hate AA
So I've been around AA for a while.  8 years.  Over a thousand meetings.  Sober 95% of that time - topped out at about 3 years.

Turns out I just don't like the AA program.  There is some useful stuff in it, but most of it makes me cringe.  But I need to be around other recovering people and there is really no other viable forum to do so.  There are like 2 smart recovery meetings a month in some far off fuckburg.  So I'm stuck in AA and I'm kind of reconciled to that.  I just wish people would stop talking about AA in the AA meetings.  Its just the worst. ",
"How sobriety has changed my life.
Hey everyone! Just want to share something with you all. A little less than 2 years ago I was locked up in a psych ward on a 7 day detox. My life was out of control - I couldn't stop drinking, using, stealing, lying and generally just being a waste of life. I had gotten kicked out of college and my apartment, had to move back in with my mother and my fiancé left me. I had my first dose of recovery in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous (this isn't the only way to get sober - it's just the way that worked for me). Since that day I have surrendered, worked the steps and become a completely different person. 

My fiancé and I got back together, I got back into graduate school, I got married to the love of my life, I got my Masters degree, I conceived a child, I moved to a new state, I started a Doctoral program and am currently sitting in the hospital awaiting the arrival of my first-born. 

You may notice that in the above paragraph I used the word ""I"" quite a bit (not purposefully). That's pretty funny because ""I"" didn't do any of this. I couldn't and I can't - I'm a low down addict and alcoholic. But surrounding myself with people in recovery, working to help another alcoholic/addict on a daily basis and working towards a spiritual connection (or at least not closing my mind to this idea) has given me everything I thought I had lost, and more. 

I just want to thank all those out there who continue to help the seemingly hopeless and also tell those who seem hopeless themselves, recovery is possible! ",
"Finding a Pill on the Ground and Throwing it Away
Hi everyone, first time posting here. Anyways I am almost 2 years clean from opiod pills as well as heroin. Long story short was just walking through a park with my boyfriend and Saw a Baggie on the ground. Inside I saw 4 square pieces of yellow pill. Immediately I knew it as a 2mg Xanax (I've never even done benzos but I guess being a previous pillhead I taught myself a lot of knowledge). I looked it up to confirm because my boyfriend was curious and I was curious if I was correct in my guess. Turns out I was and immediately said that we need to throw this away to make sure no little kid finds it like I just did. Feels good to be clean:). ",
"Miracles happen!
I am 23 years old. My clean date is 5 November 2011: I've been clean for three years today! I've been homeless, jobless, single, and arrested (all clean!), but have still never found a reason to get high in three years. Now I am a valued employee with my own apartment and car. In the past year alone, I have gotten married and made the decision to continue my college education (I have straight A's). Life is good because I have done some work.

"""any problems taking vicodin?""
That's what the dentist asked me yesterday after spending 90 minutes cutting/grinding/yanking my last wisdom tooth out.

I had already put in my paperwork that I'm an addict, and that I want to avoid narcotics. I had also mentioned to the dentist a couple times that I was fine with motrin. Still, she's just doing her job. I guess it's normal to offer vicodin to people that get things ripped out of their faces.

I'm glad I have benefited from listening to other addicts go through similar or worse experiences with taking narcotics. My mouth said no to the vicodin before my brain really had a chance to think about it.

I'm really glad I did that. The pain is honestly not that bad. I'm kinda surprised that anyone takes vicodin for this. Prescription-strength ibuprofen is doing the trick. There's still a dull ache, but that's nothing compared to the pain a relapse would bring.",

"He deserved a proper obituary.
(Hope it's okay to post this here.  Never forget that people love you, even if they have had to step away from you.  Stay strong in your recovery.)

I spoke of you last night to a friend.  I hadn't in quite some time.  I mentioned, so very briefly, my experiences with you, simply as a benchmark of how strong I got throughout the years since knowing you - strong about setting up boundaries with others, no longer trying to heal the broken wings of the birds around me, remembering my needs over the needs of others.  And then I moved on in the conversation to another topic.  

This morning, over coffee, while sitting in front of my computer, the thought of you resurfaced and I wondered where you were. I googled your name.  I hadn't googled it in quite some time but still had the hope that one day if I googled it, I would see a facebook or linkedin profile that would put my hopes for you into reality.  But I didn't find any profiles or perhaps a family picture.  I found an obituary that simply showed your name, your city, your date of birth and your date of death.  I wasn't sure how I felt about it but I knew I had to go to work with a crazy hectic day where I wouldn't be alone for a minute so I pushed it aside.

I came home from work and started searching google again.  Your name was found on a memorial to the homeless who die in Toronto.  I then found your death itemized in someone's blog and I found it.  I knew but I had to see proof.  You died of a heroin overdose, didn't you?  Am I wrong?  I would love to be.  Honestly, I was surprised that you lived this long after losing everything so many years ago and ending up on the streets but we did always joke that you had more lives than a cat.   

My story with you ended when you moved to the streets, where we finally split ways.  Well, actually, it doesn't end there because for many months I drove by Queen and Sherbourne, knowing that you were living there, on the streets or in the shelters, doing any drug you could get your hands on but still attached to your first love, heroin.  And there was a certain part of me that thought if I didn't see you hanging out there, that maybe, just maybe, you had finally gotten clean.  Maybe.  And maybe you did.  For a while.   Maybe more than once.  So many years have passed.  Maybe.  

I called the same friend and told her what I had found online.  She asked for more detail and I offered it but it was all negative.  I recounted the most terrible moments of our relationship and living with your addiction while you spiralled downward so rapidly.  I hung up and I finally cried.  I cried for the lost potential, the sadness, the anger, the hatred for these drugs that not only destroy the lives of addicts but those around them, for your family, for your pets, for it all...

And then I remembered the good.  And while some would say that you used me during those years, I'll still remember the good as being sincere.  I have to.  I believe that something in you was good, but your addiction was too strong and this terrible, black illness took over your life and destroyed it.  

So with that being said, you deserve more than a blank obituary... and it deserves to be positive.  I give this last thing to you:

D. was adopted at an early age and loved so very dearly by his adoptive mother.  She recounted often how his energy and love of life kept her energized having raised him with a sister in Toronto.  D. did not excel at school, but excelled with people.  His ability to talk to anyone, make anyone feel comfortable and entertained surpassed most.  People gravitated towards him.  They enjoyed him.  They laughed with him.  And they knew that D. would give the shirt off his back for them often taking people in to live with him, giving to someone, even if it was just the benefit of the doubt.  

He started his career and success was all around him.  How could it not?  He loved the money and the fast life.  That world came so natural to him.  He had the perfect personality for it.  He made people feel welcomed.  He could sell ice to an eskimo.  And the eskimos loved the interaction!  

He loved animals.  He loved talking on the phone.  He loved his mother, his friends and his mentor.  He loved cars.  He loved food.  He loved his deep fryer.  He loved his ikea furniture in his apartment.  He loved his ergonomic laundry basket.  He loved his button down shirts.  His love was childlike and so innocent at times.  He made people around him love things too.

And on a more personal note: Thank you for the laughs D.  Thank you for breaking down my wall and opening a whole new world for me.  Thank you for showing me off, I always felt so special.  Thank you for teaching me how to drive and helping me buy my first car.  Thank you for allowing me to see the world through your eyes.  And most importantly, thank you for choosing my dog that day at the shelter.  I walked by him so many times but you spotted him and we have been a great match.

I learnt a lot from you D and I'm a better person for having known you.  Rest in peace.  Your demons are no longer.

Thank you to the workers and volunteers who help our homeless everyday.  You stand in when friends and family are unable to stand anymore.  You are the strong ones in this world and you do so much good.  Thank you for doing what I could no longer do.",
"A powerful reminder
Yesterday was a long, frustrating day. I'm facing the biggest life change since I got clean 3 1/2 years ago and I'm stressed and anxious and completely wrapped up in my own problems. I really just wanted to get home and go to bed.

Fortunately that wasn't an option. I finally made an appointment to get my taxes done and I was due there at 7pm. I arrived 5 minutes early and had to wait almost 30 minutes for my tax preparer to be ready for me. I was just about to leave because I'm impatient and it's all about me. I am glad I didn't.

Towards the end of our session she asked me where I work. When I told her (halfway house) she started to tear up and tell me about her son. He's struggling the struggle that only we know. I could feel her fear and bewilderment when she told me a few specific stories. Over the next half hour I did my best to give her some hope. I told her some of my story, let her know that she isn't alone and recommended Al/Nar-Anon.

She told me that her son has lost friends to OD, one as recently as 3 weeks ago. I gave her my work and cell number and told her if her son ever wants to talk to someone who won't judge him he can call me any time. I then hugged this stranger and urged her not to lose faith. After all, I am not special and I'm doing it.

I then went to an AA meeting I haven't been to in a while. When I walked in I saw a face that disappeared from the rooms almost 2 years ago. I gave him a hug and asked how he was doing. He was back from a bad experience, and I got to let him know how happy I was to see him again. 

The speaker was the father of the child who OD'd 3 weeks ago as a direct result of this disease. The room was absolutely silent as he carried the message. It was a powerful meeting.


It all reminded me that my day to day problems are nothing compared to where I came from. It reminded me of why I *want* to be involved in AA and NA fellowships. It reminded me that no matter how bad I think my day is going, if I can manage to help one other person who is struggling with this disease then I am indeed a lucky man. Mostly though I am reminded that I need to call my Mom, because she went through her own personal hell as I went through mine.

TL;DR: I know hard times and this ain't it.",

Dear reddit,
I am almost 9 months clean after being addicted for 3 years. I messed up my whole life in terms of collage and such. 

My mother never know the reason for me messing up as bad as i did. 

Until i finally toild her, the meetings i run off to at night. (i don't live at her house but i am there a fair bit) are NA meetings and that i have been addicted for quite a while. But clean now.

She was shocked very shocked, but she hugged me and toild me she is very proud of me for being clean!

And it made me feel so good!!! 
And she is joining me to a meeting next week! To get to know and support me in my diseas.

I feel really happy and free!! Because i now don't have to lie about where im going what is happening in my mind! ",

Just thought I would share my experience with y'all as I know this can be a huge source of stress for many just as it was for me.

Last night was my first night back at work after 5 weeks in rehab for the second time. Same job and many of the same people.

I am a dispatcher at UPS and see and talk to roughly 200 drivers nightly all of whom have noticed my absence and most of whom have known the reason for it.

For the last couple weeks the anxiety has been building about this and although I have no desire to use right now I can see how this could temp others.

I sat it the parking lot for 5 minutes before going in and asked God to help me through this and to help me answer all the questions I knew where coming.

I'm happy to report today that I was shown nothing but love from all those people who really care about me. 99% of the remarks where along the lines of ""good to have you back, glad you're doing well"".

If you're facing the same situation soon try to relax; I promise it won't be nearly as bad as your brain had made it out to be.

"Former AA member who’s been using for two years now. Tried listening to AA tapes, and it makes me cringe. Tried smart meetings but there’s no members in my area. What other options do I have?
Hello everyone. So I was in AA, and I worked the steps THOROUGHLY with one of the most respected AA’ers in my state. I eventually grew resentful with AA and after having gone through the steps n doing everything I was supposed to be doing and not feeling aaaaaanyyyyyyyyy better, I said fuck it n started using again.

Prior to AA I was trying to check out smart meetings too. I went to a couple in my area and there was no one there.

I’ve recently tried listening to AA tapes and to put it lightly, it was cringeworthy. The same recycled, redundant nonsense that you hear at every meeting.

Are there any options I don’t know about as far as recovery groups? I need help.

"Day 46 of Sobriety from Heroin
Hey folks! 

I just found this subreddit and I want to join in the fun. Today marks the longest I've gone without any psychoactive substance (except caffeine and nicotine patches) since I was 15. It's been a hell of a ride, and I'm only 23.

A bit of a backstory on me: I dabbled with Hydrocodone and Oxycodone in high school, like an idiot. But I didn't develop a serious chemical dependency until I was 19. I used obscene amounts of alprazolam for months (that part of my life is a black hole). Then after I weened off of my 30-40mg addiction to alprazolam; I started using Oxymorphone, Hydromorphone, and Oxycodone. 

At that point of my life (21 years old) I was still adamantly against needles. I started ordering fentanyl off of the darkweb in the fall of 2016. In the following few months I overdosed 4 times, I'm lucky to be alive. My now fiancè saved my life by performing CPR on me on two of those instances. Anyway, I ended up in an IOP program about a year ago now and I was on Suboxone for 6 months. 

After my stint in IOP, I stayed sober for two months. Then one night last September, I had a horrible craving and bought heroin for the first time in a good while. Within a month I was an IV user. I started falling behind on my bills so I could afford the $200+/day heroin addiction. I'm sure the story is familiar to some.

March 3rd, 2018 I talked to my parents and my fiancé's parents begging for help. We were both (as in my fiancè and I) on the verge of total financial collapse and subsequent  homelessness. She went to an inpatient rehab and as I had no insurance, I went cold turkey and sweated it out at my parent's house for 8 days.

So that was longer than I expected; but alas there it is. Currently my fiancè is living at a sober living apartment and I'm traveling the Carolinas for work all summer. Everything has been going really well! We're both attending NA meetings (I attend about 3-4 a week, I'm trying to increase that number.) 

Recently, I've been riding what's the so-called ""pink cloud"". As in I feel really good and I'm highly motivated in all facets of my life. I know I've got to be careful, because this is not the norm. Any advice in regards to the pink cloud would be fantastic! 

Well that's my story guys. I'll definitely be around on this subreddit a lot. Whoever would like to chat about recovery/life in general, I'll be here! Have a great day yall! 

Just for today, I'll stay sober.

"Stay sober--you are worth it
My best friend's little brother overdosed on Monday and went into cardiac arrest. After several days in a coma, they've determined he is brain dead and they will donate his organs tomorrow. 

He leaves behind a 4 month old son. He had been clean for several months now and was doing a great job as a dad. Now his son will never know him.

If you're wanting to relapse or are struggling, please talk to someone. You are worth it, and you are more than your addiction. I wish I'd told all these things to him, as well as how proud I was of him for all the hard work he had put in to try to beat his addiction. Every day will be hard, but keep fighting. Don't give up. You're worth it.",
"To anyone who is turned off by the “higher power
I, initially was completely turned off by almost every sobriety/recovery group that had anything to do with a ‘higher power’z It seems like no matter how hard you search you will never find a sobriety group that doesn’t reference a higher power.

Well, something that took me forever to realize is that ‘higher power’ doesn’t HAVE to have religious connotations. I was raised in a completely ambiguous household. My parents had their own beliefs which to this day (I’m almost 21) I still don’t know exactly what they identify as. We never had to go to church, religion just had 0% of mine and my 3 older siblings upbringing. I myself classify myself as agnostic. I find afterlives and anything beyond what is proven as black magic but I am completely willing and open to people proving me wrong.

Now as far as recovery goes, when I first started trying to find groups they all just seemed like church groups but what I’ve found for myself is that they leave it open to interpretation. I’ve always considered the “higher power” in recovery to be the voice inside myself who really knows what’s best. My parents who only want what’s good for me. All the potential I had before I got into coke and opiates. “Higher power” doesn’t have to be a religious thing. It’s just anything in you or in your life that you want to live up to.",

"Lucky to be alive and clean
I am a recovering drug addict and my life story is pretty crazy. It would take an entire book to go over everything I've been through mostly because of drugs, but here's a small glimpse. I've been used, abused, raped, and held hostage. I've done unspeakable things. I lost my best friend to suicide when I was 18 and many other friends to addiction over the years. I've had an eating disorder since I was young, and always suffered from anxiety and depression. I have had alcoholic pancreatitis 6 separate times, each time it got progressively worse and the last episode almost killed me. I've been told that if I drink again I will die. I started using opiates when I was 17 and eventually it led me to shooting heroin. on March 1st 2016, I thought I was sick with a severe flu or possibly just detoxing. I was throwing up, had diarrhea, fever of 105 and could barely walk. After a week of this I finally went to the ER. Good thing I did, because turns out I had actually developed a heart infection called endocarditis from IV heroin use. Like many my use started off socially and quickly turned into a daily battle. Heroin had my soul for a long time. I lost everything. Anyway, the doctors expected the infection to get better with antibiotics but my condition only got worse. My kidneys failed and I needed to have dialysis done every day. My body went into septic shock. After a few weeks they came to the conclusion that I needed open heart surgery, but feared that I wouldn't survive it because I was in such bad shape.  I had my tricuspid valve replaced with a pig valve. I lost so much blood during the surgery that they didn't think I would make it. They also had to give me enough pain killers and anesthesia to knock out an elephant because my opiate tolerance was so high.  I didn't wake up afterwards for two weeks. My family was afraid that I would never wake up. During this time, they had me on Ketamine and fentanyl to manage the pain. This caused me to have severe, disturbing hallucinations about past experiences that were very traumatizing to me. After I woke up I thought the hallucinations were real, and it took weeks for the doctors and nurses to convince me that nothing actually happened. After all this, they thought I was starting to recover. It's hard for me to remember much from this time because I was mostly sedated. My open heart surgery was surprisingly successful, though they described it as a ""salvage attempt"". But then my condition started to rapidly decline. I couldn't breathe without being hooked up to oxygen. Eventually they put in a trach (cut a hole in my throat so I could be hooked up to a machine that breathed for me). They would also stick a tube down my throat every 15 minutes to suck up the mucus to help clear my airway. I was hooked up to a feeding tube and had a catheter put in because I could not sit up or walk to go to the bathroom. I wasn't able to talk either..I felt so helpless. I felt like I was dying, the pain was indescribable. I was also having panic attacks because of everything that was happening which made it so much worse. They couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting better. My kidneys were still not functioning and I needed dialysis every day. Eventually they ran tests on my lungs, and found that I had a rare infection called Blastomycosis. My lungs were completely filled with mucus, which was why I wasn't able to breathe on my own. Normally this wouldn't be life-threatening, but since I was already basically dying it only added to the hell my body was going through.  To this day they haven't figured out how I got the infection. After this grim diagnosis, 3 doctors came into my hospital room and told me that I would probably not make it. Said to say goodbye to my family and everything. They asked me if I wanted to be made comfortable, go out peacefully so I didn't have to feel this torturous pain anymore. I told them absolutely not and that I was going to fight with everything in me. My parents were by my side every single day and night and without them I probably would have given up. It took a lot of mental and physical suffering but I survived. My lungs slowly improved and after a few months I could finally breathe on my own again. My kidney function also started improving and eventually dialysis was not needed anymore. After 3 1/2 months of lying in a hospital bed my muscles deconditioned severely. I had to learn to walk again and build up strength to function normally. Just being able to sit up on my own again felt like a victory. Putting my socks on without assistance was an accomplishment. After they took my trach out, I was able to talk and eat/drink again so they took my feeding tube out. It took about a month for my stomach to handle real food again, so I would usually throw up every time I ate something. I was 75 pounds when they released me from the hospital, and then I spent another 3 weeks in a rehabilitation center doing physical therapy. Just when I thought I could finally go home, I had to be hospitalized again because my calcium levels were dangerously high. I spent another 3 days there. It took a long time for me to gain my weight back and feel ""normal"" doing everyday activities. I lost all of my hair due to the medications I was on, from losing so much weight and also because of the trauma my body went through. I have scars on my chest, stomach and throat from the operations and procedures I had to go through. I have permanent nerve damage from losing so much blood and from some of the medications. My lung function is only at 60% because of so much scarring from the infection. Despite these physical and emotional issues caused from what I went through, I have gained so much. I am finally clean from heroin. This experience opened my eyes to what I was doing to myself and my family. I truly feel that everything happens for a reason, and this happened to me so that I could stop using drugs and change my life. Something I had been trying to do with no avail for so many years. I now have a healthy relationship with my parents and have nothing to hide from them. I am finally living a normal, successful life free from the grip of drugs and alcohol. My hair has grown back, I look healthy and feel better than I have in years. I am slowly regaining everything my addiction took from me. I now have faith that a higher power does exist, because there is no other way to explain how I could have survived something so extreme. This experience almost killed me but instead gave me my life back. I am forever grateful.  ",
"Would you guys be interested in a podcast about careers in recovery?
Hey everyone,

I was driving to work this morning thinking about podcast. I've always wanted to start one, and I have been really successful in my career so far. I know there are a lot of other people in recovery who have as well.  and a lot of people that feel stuck working as a server or in a minimum wage soul sucking job.

In 12 step meetings its something that's not really talked about, and for good reason. Especially for the newcomer. I don't think people should just run out and get degrees right when they start out or get the impression that they should.

So I would like to start something for people that have a foundation and want to know what their options are, hear how people did it and stayed clean and sober, and to know that just because you have a record or feel behind doesn't mean that you can't change and find something fulfilling.

I feel like being in recovery, in terms of a career we have unique challenges that most people don't have to face. Especially because have ot take in out spiritual health way before personal development. It can be hard learning when to make the jump and start being productive members of society outside of the room.

Would anyone be interested in something like this? ",
"4 months clean! It’s mind blowing!
I’ve posted here a few about my recovery from opioid and suboxone addiction. 12 year opioid addict, about half of that as a suboxone addict (with many relapses in between). This is the first time in 12 years I have been off pills, heroin or suboxone completely. So I just hit 4 months clean and sober a few days ago. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to who understands and I love this sub for that! 
So anyways it’s still going pretty good. Still a lot of issues with anxiety and insomnia. Some rls when I try to sleep still but I can usually fight through it. My energy levels are still pretty crappy but I do notice them very slowly getting a little better. Cravings have been very mild! For the most part. I had a dream the other night I found a suboxone strip in an old purse. So of course when I woke up the next day I dug through all my old bags hoping to find a piece. I didn’t thank god! If I would’ve I know I would’ve taken it, so that’s a little terrifying. That’s the first really bad craving I’ve had since I’ve been out of the active physical withdrawal. But anyways, like always I hope this may help some one else going through anything similar. Hang in there!

"Going back to rehab tomorrow
The day I have been waiting for. This will be my 3rd time in a year. Something has to give. I am over this lifestyle. I am over the dirt bag people that come with it. I am over the shady manipulative things I am doing. Most of all I'm tired of losing. 

I have been living in a sober house since October. I transitioned to a THU from the same establishment I am going back to tomorrow. I was doing great when I first got out. I was going to meetings, fellowshipping with sober people and feeling like a productive member of society again. I knew my biggest trigger for relapse would be women so I tried my best to keep them at bay. But one girl I met at treatment was so much like me the thought of relapse with her seemed very likely and very desirable. I made it to my 60th day and I was so proud of myself. I had a meeting planned and was gonna go eat with family. Low and behold the girl I speak about says it's time to relapse. I knew what would follow suit with that, great sex and our relationship getting stronger so I was all for it. For the first month or two I was only snorting the meth. But then I stopped getting high. I am an IV user and if anyone knows what that is like there is no stopping that monster once it's been awoken. This whole time I am maintaining residency at the sober house still flying under the radar and getting by. I was seeing my daughter as much as possible, whom I had just met when I got out of rehab in October. She's only two so it's not to late to let her know who daddy is. My relationship with that chick was on the rocks and I got into it bad again. I was dropping weight like crazy and even beginning to smell strange. Strange enough to where people did not wanna be around me. At this time I had stopped meetings completely and my goal every morning was how am I gonna get high today. I didn't get back into robbing people or doing anything that dirty but I was resorting to people places and things I wouldn't normally associate or surround myself with. Last week my house hit me with a random drug test. Of course I failed and policy is I have to leave for three days and when I come back if I can piss clean I'm back in. Those three days I didn't use. I 5150'ed and even stayed in a homeless shelter. Needles to say I made it back in. Those three days were hell. Today at noon I got the call from my outpatient counselor saying my bed was ready. I have been estatic since. 11a.m tomorrow I get another chance at life and to things right. Send my your prayers and love please. And tips!

Everyone's experience with withdrawals and recovery is different, let's support each other and not discredit or trivialise anyone's personal experience with it. Recovery is highly rewarding and has huge benefits, but it's a process, it's a journey and it's not any easy one at times. When you have been using/drinking especially for a significant amount of time, it will cause an initial period of both physical and mental trauma, it does ease of,  but it will likely be taxing both mentally and physically when in initial, accute withdrawal. Here are some reasons why;
1) You may experience some uncomfortable physical symptoms during withdrawal and early recovery. This can be difficult deal with at times. Everyone experiences this differently.
2) Especially if you're personal picture of recovery doesn't include any narcotics, it can be common to go through a period of intense emotions, as your senses and chemistry evens out and your body learns to cope without substances. This affects everyone differently and to different degrees. You may get flooded with intense emotions about trauma or feel very sad at times or very angry, even though you never felt like this prior/during the use of your substance of choice. It does ease off dramatically, but can be intense at first. This is well documented and shouldn't be denied, discredited or trivialised if someone shares about it..
3) You can get used to instant relief and may need to find different coping strategies.
4) You have to combat addictive thought processes and behaviours.
5) You may need to sever ties or set boundaries with people in your life in active addiction. This may require you to adopt a new social setting and friends. 
6) You may find that you need to re evaluate your values, perspective and thoughts pertaining to your life and what you want out of it.
7) Often life after addiction may seem uneventful compared to life as an addict. It may take time to get used to this.
Tips : it's really good to set goals in recovery, also it can be very empowering to see yourself achieving things.
When your find yourself experiencing negative or addictive thought processes, be aware of those thoughts, break them down and try to find the source of it and  work through it. 
Recovery is great. It has been long and exhausting, but to reclaim your life and to see yourself kicking some major goals is amazing.
Let's be there for one another. Your not alone. Your experience is valid. You can beat addiction. If anyone one needs my support or has any questions, or if I can help in any way. I'm here for you!!. There is life after addiction. And we are all stronger than we are aware. Let's fight this beast together!.",
"Hope from a low bottom recovering alcoholic
Hi guys.  Long time reader, infrequent poster.  At my home group today, we talked about how important it is to share our experience, strength,  and hope with others; so I thought I'd post my journey in hopes that it will give someone the courage to get up and try again. :)

**long post alert**

I post something like this every year, but every year I have more blessings  to add to the end. So here goes:

October 3, 2011 is my sobriety birthday.  5 years and 3 months ago, I was laying in a bed at a local hotel.  Too drunk and sick to even get to the bathroom to throw up.  I had relapsed again, and truly lost everything.  My first husband had divorced me and I drank away a lucrative career as a civil engineer.  I had no job, no money, no car, no license, no friends, no family, and nothing to live for (so I thought).  My loved ones had given up on me.  My boyfriend (at the time), had even given up.  My parents had my dog but could no longer allow me at their house.  They paid for 1 week in that hotel because they knew I'd drink myself to death in less than a week.  I had burned all my bridges and nobody would take me in.  Rehabs, psych wards, jails, friends, family, hospitals, shelters, and hotels all knew me and wouldn't take me in.  My mom had my power of attorney and had pre-written my obituary.  By that time, I had attempted suicide twice and couldn't even do that right.  I was completely and utterly hopeless.

The next day, my sister talked a rehab center in Saginaw, MI into accepting me (this would be my sixth stint in a rehab, including a year at Mission Teens).  My boyfriend figured out where I was and came to get me. He picked me up out of a pile of vomit and brought me home to clean up. When he left, he told me he never wanted to see me again. I flew down to Saginaw that night, sick as a dog from detoxing.  I remember I was hallucinating bugs on my arms, but I knew they weren't real.  But I didn't drink because they wouldn't take me in if I was drunk.

1 month there and another month or so in a half-way house before anyone was willing to let me come home.  Nobody trusted me.  But, I knew something felt different.  I had finally had enough.  Something clicked.  I didn't want to die.

Fast forward.  I haven't had a drink since that day, 5 years and 3 months ago.  It wasn't easy. It wasn't quick.  But it was the most rewarding decision I've ever made.  God has restored my life in unimaginable ways, but I had to work for it.  I kept busy with meetings, home improvement projects, and volunteering at the animal shelter.  I worked 100's of hours of community service to pay my fines & court costs. Then, God started giving me things back.  Someone took a chance on me and I got a job (that I had to walk to for a year, in Upper Michigan - lots of snow). I got a restricted license with a breathalyzer and a beat up old truck.  I got my family back.  They started inviting me to holidays again.  I got my relationship with my parents back, and enjoy being trustworthy and helpful for them.   I got married to the man that's been with me through it all, and I love with all my heart.  I got a regular license and a nice shiny new truck.  After almost 4 years at that first job, I was offered a management position at a large home - improvement store and I absolutely love it.  I consider my co-workers (from both places) good friends.  I have my dog and 2 cats living with us and they are well-cared for.  I have a garden.  I married into a great family and was blessed with 3 step children and 3 grandkids. And after much praying and hoping, I will soon be trying to have a baby of my very own. A little piece of me and the love of my life.  And I have a second mommy & inlaws who I just love!!  I was sober and strong to hold up my husband when his brother and oldest son died.  I have gone from a lost-cause to someone who people ask for help for their own sobriety.  I've been asked to speak at meetings and rehab centers. I am healthy.  I can donate blood regularly (which I do as my way of making amends towards all the bills that our local hospital forgave for me).  Last year, I graduated  from our Chamber of Commerce Delta Force leadership group.  I am a productive member of society and an active part of this community that I love.  This community took care of me when I couldn't, and I never thought I'd be a valued part of it again, but I am.  The police, jailers, doctors, therapists, and paramedics in this town know me and are friendly & encouraging when I see them in public now.

The AA promises really came true.  God has fully restored my life and given me so much more than I ever dreamed.  I look forward to the future.  I am forever grateful to God, my husband, my family, my recovery family, friends, co-workers, and the kind people of this community who helped me back up and now accept me as an equal.  I love them all.  I'm thankful to all the people who showed me kindness and were willing to help me, no matter how many times I failed in the past.  And for everyone who ever offered an encouraging word.  They are all heros.  They saved a life.  <3 <3 <3

My mom hosts a dinner every year to celebrate and says it's her favorite holiday.  All the family I thought I'd lost forever comes over to hug me and tell me how proud they are of me.  It warms my heart. ",
"I Went to a Sober Morning Rave
I love to dance - especially to EDM in clubs with laser lights - but being in recovery, I have no business being a in bar or around people who are wasted. 

I'm so glad more and more cities are having [sober morning raves](http://www.undeniableruth.com/2016/02/13/sober-morning-rave/). I went to my first one a few days ago and it was awesome. It was exactly what I needed after a particularly draining week.",
"So I made the choice, and I am finally going to be admitted to in patient rehab, for my drug abuse problem. I am very worried, as it is 3 weeks, and I have massive anxiety when I feel locked up. Also I am taking high level pain medication for my back, and I am scared of withdrawl. Any advice?
Also, I am asking them if I can have my only comfort.  My gameboy.  It is the only thing that lets me feel better.  I doubt they will let me (the place is bradford).  Seriously I would have 0 doubts about spending 3 weeks in a dressed up jail, detoxing feeling sick and depressed just to try and find a way to kick my bad habits.  Could I sneak in my gameboy?  I really need it, or I am going to feel terrible. I am quite worried about this. I am doing this for my wife, and my 5 month old son, and myself also, but more so for them.  I am just feeling overwhelmed, like as if I was sentenced to jail. ",
"Sobered up from drug use, now it feels like reality is almost ""too vivid"". Can anyone relate?
Has anyone else felt like this? 

Its like the world is almost too bright, too vivid. Its intense. My sense of smell is getting better and reminding me of things that I used to smell. This is kind of a hard experience to explain, but does anyone know what I'm talking about? Can you relate?",
"One year sober this week!
My sober date was Wednesday, and I couldn't be happier. There have been a few moments when I'm disappointed in the lack of progress I've made, but many more moments of clarity and appreciation.

Best was receiving a medallion at my meeting tonight. I only recently committed myself to a home group - a room that I love more each week. Of course, there has been that awkward getting-to-know people period, full of cold introductions and not always having the nerve to ask for numbers. Somebody in the group offered to let me celebrate, and a good friend presented, which was a fantastic opportunity to meet members of the group, not to mention a wonderful experience in itself.

And I'm greedy, so I get to celebrate with my other home group Sunday. ",

Hi all, recently went to a couple shows some dubstep at Higher Ground Showcase in Burlington VT and some dead tribute shows at Nectar's lounge and restaurant, and had absolute blast!

"I'm an 18 year old Compsci major and recently lost 99 days sober to the meth pipe.
I have 13 days now thankfully this time I only went out for 16 hours before getting the help of the fellowship. But I still don't understand why I did it, it was terrible, I guess I still struggle with the fact that I'm a dope fiend for life and a bitch to meth and heroin while the rest of family doesn't have to worry about doing dope again in the suburbs with all of the money they have made. I've recently been feeling so fucking(scuse' my French) alone in recovery even though I'm surrounded with people that want me to be happy like them. I have no friends at college and go the whoe day without getting in a single conversation usually. Most people my age think very differently than me, and don't have several court cases pending that hold their future in the balance, and most don't get it because they still haven't progressed far enough, or just aren't addicts. And I just wish I was normal(whatever that means) ignorance is definitely bliss, and unlike heroin it doesn't ruin your life but unfortunately I picked the latter. Sorry for the rant thank you all for listening, and I know this is completely just ranting and feeling sorry for myself but I will get what you have, I have to. Thanks for reading this whoever did(:",
"Sober for Two Years, Planning to go to First AA Meeting Tonight. I Know What to Expect But Any Actionable Advice?
I am 30. Horrible alcoholic. Hospitalized 2x in my teens. Binge drinker and every day drinker. Stopped drinking between 22 and 25 for month or two month bursts. ""Real"" sober at 25-26.5 but white knuckled it the whole time. Relapsed for a year but then 100% embraced sobriety and owned the thing. Like for real. I have felt like the Terminator the last two years.

But then last week I felt weak and powerless for not being able to drink with my SO. I saw my friends partying over the weekend and got oddly upset I could not.  I felt the first tiny thought of rationalizing drinking again and then thoughts started to spiral. They feel all too familiar when I relapsed last time.

I am planning to go to AA tonight at 8pm. I somewhat know what to expect but does anyone have advice for me? Should I speak up? Should I tell them I want the help of someone there? I am real outgoing but I am afraid I might go, say nothing, and leave and not go back. I think I really need to do this since the illusion I can on my own has just evaporated. Any advice would help. I want to start it on the right foot.

EDIT/UPDATE
I want to say a huge THANKS to everyone who commented on here. All your replies were very, very insightful and with your knowledge I went to my first meeting! All this advice gave me the courage to go into it since I was very reluctant to go in so cold. I am so glad that you all let me know about the exchanging numbers thing.  I would have been very weirded out when that happened if I did not know that it was normal or expected. Truly, thanks for all your words. I am going to go to another tomorrow and I want to keep going since I can't do it on my own anymore.",

"4 Years Ago Today
4 years ago today, I was planning one final bender, one last binge, before I turned out the lights for good. I hadn't eaten solid food besides the occasional packet of ramen noodles in almost 6 months, living off of Ensure, xanax, ativan, valium, vicodin and vodka. I had been unemployed for more than a year, laid off from the job I had had for 11 years. I was in poor health, having lost more than a foot of my large intestine, do to my terrible eating habits and habitual drug use. I didn't care about my wife of 15 years, or my 10 year old son, all I cared about was poor me, poor me, why did I have to get sick? why did I have to lose my job? all the while not doing a single fucking thing to change my situation, just committing slow suicide with any substance I could get my hands on. 

The preceding 20 years had been a litany of fuckwit decisions and very, very narrowly avoided consequences. I took my first drink when I was 7 or 8 years old, from a family member who thought it was funny to give a kid Baileys. I took my first drug when I was 16, acid, and discovered what I (thought) was born to do: Get Loaded. I got involved in meth, and heavily into alcohol. I left home and got in with some really questionable situations. I remember being 18 and hanging out on stoops in cities with Hell's Angels and 13 year old runaways. I got my ass beaten, got arrested, met a woman and decided to clean up my act. 

I got married when I was 21, because the consequences were piling up and this girl said she could save me from them. I spent 6 months dry, taking any other substance I could reach, but always maintaining. Somehow, just avoiding booze and meth, I was able to improve my life enough to get a real job, and start making money. I partied on the weekends and smoked weed every night, but, hey, I wasn't drinking or snorting crank, right? Besides, I had insomnia, and marijuana is an herb, not a chemical, right? Never mind that I'd go on business trips and drink until I blacked out (thank you, expense account!) every night for 2 weeks straight, I was maintaining. I had a kid, and was able to be there for him, even if I was hung-over and thinking about my next spree. 

Then I got sick, and lost my job. In April, 2008, my company laid me off, the day after my sons 10th birthday, my job went to India. They gave me a HUGE severance package, and cleaning out my 401K before the market cratered any harder. I had a fuckton of money, my doctor signed my up for disability, and I finally had the time and means to indulge my disease the way it always wanted. The day I got laid off, I went to my doctor and told him how stressed I was, that I needed some refillable prescriptions for xanax. The day after that, I went to the weed doctor, waved my big bottle of xanax at him and said, 'If they're giving me this much shit, clearly I need medical marijuana!' and I decided I wasn't coming down. I even had money to develop a short lived coke habit, I'd never been able to afford one before. It was great, but every month my xanax would run out before my refill was due, and the pain of withdrawals would trigger an attack of my digestive ailment, and I would end up in the hospital. Where they'd give me IV dilaudid and IV benzos. I loved the hospital. Eventually they removed a bunch of my intestines, and a month later I got sick again. I told me if I came back, I would have to have a colostomy. I decided that death was better than being deformed, and just stopped eating.

Then, May 22nd, 2009, I had a friend coming in to town, my brother in law, someone I had partied with in the past. I laid in a supply of e, hash, booze and pills, one last hurrah, and then hopefully a gentle overdose, and no more fucking headache, no more unemployment, no more having to be a father. I went to take a nap, so I could stay up later and die.

When I woke up, I walked into my living room, and it was full of people. My first thought was, honest to god, 'I don't have enough e for all these people!!!', then it hit me, it was an intervention. I started laughing. I couldn't stop. The ludicrousness of it, that they thought they could help me, that there was any other end to this except my death, was hilarious to me. The fools, the poor, misguided fools. My mom was there, my wife, my friends, my dad. Didn't they realize, *they* made me like this! They had fucked me up and pushed me to being this way! Fuck them!! But I went. I was too tired to fight, and I thought, well, ""I'm going to die anyway, let's go"".

The detox was hell, I was insane. I muttered under my breath and planned murder. I was going to kill the people who put me here, but I realized I was too fucked up to do it, I needed to detox, then I could murder them. I resolved to do every single thing that was asked of me, every one, just to fool them, so they could trust me, and I could show them, it's not the drugs, I am an evil person, and fuck you for expecting me to be different. But then a miracle happened. I got better. With all the drugs out of my body for the first time in 11 years, literally, I had been high every day for 11 years, I felt it, I felt the giant whole in the center of my being, the emptiness that I had been trying forever to fill up, with drugs, booze, women, whatever I thought could fit. I felt it, and I wept, I wept until I couldn't breath, and I asked the universe, god, any god, any power that might be listening, to help me, and the universe answered. Somewhere, I don't know where it came from, I found a tiny crumb of faith, a tiny piece, like a grain of sand, and I held it. I had been empty so long, that tiny crumb felt like a mountain, and for the first time in 20 years, I lost the desire to drink or take drugs. I held that piece of faith, like a match flickering in the bottom of a mine, and I nursed it, I protected it, I worked to make it strong. I did everything that the program asked of me, and I recovered.

I'm living proof of the old saying, 'the Program isn't for those that need it, or want it, but for those that **do** it'. I don't work a perfect program, but I try to do my best, and that's all that I need to do.

TL;DR: Trust God, Clean House, Help Others

Thanks for being part of my recovery.",

"1,096 Days (3yrs) as of 1/24
I'm pretty damn proud of myself but I'm still trying to put my life back together from all the destruction I caused while using and drinking.  

The relationship with my immediate family gets better every day but my parents still question some of my decisions.  My brother will make hurtful comments from time to time but I don't think it's his intention to so I try not to take it to heart.  Overall our relationship is growing as well.  He invites me to do more things together which really means a lot to me since he used to always be ""busy"" whenever I'd try.  

My friends & bf are the most supportive group I could ask for especially with living in a college town.  They supply me with endless free diet-coke whenever I venture out to watch sports, play pool or just to socialize with actual people and not just my cats (haha).  

For anyone interested, to get clean&sober I went to CDRP (through Kaiser) which was wonderful.  It was outpatient but lasted the majority of a day, seven days a week.  It was a great program and I highly recommend it.  While attending that, I was required to go to a certain amount of meetings per week so I attended AA and LifeRing.  I cherish my AA chips (I ordered a 3yr) but AA, for me, was not what was going to ""keep"" me sober.  LifeRing I thought was a pretty cool alternative and I also highly recommend those for anyone who isn't an AA fan but wants to go to a meeting of sorts.

I still have some tempting moments (especially if I'm having a horrible day) but they're VERY slowly getting easier to handle and I know to remove myself from the situation.  All in all, I think I'm doing really well and I'm looking forward to another great day.  

So to everyone out there - just keep with it because it does work and you'll feel so much more alive.  ",

"42 days today! I had forgotten how good it feels to be sober.
I posted about a month and a half ago asking for advice with detoxing off alcohol. I tried to get into a detox center, but as it turned out, I was detoxed by the time they could get me in (4 days later). 

It's been 42 days thus far. I'm taking Antabuse every day and going to meetings. I feel fucking awesome. I honestly had forgotten how healthy and productive I can be without alcohol! 

To anyone who is struggling to quit: It's so fucking worth it. I was scared out of my mind to put down the bottle - and the first couple weeks getting sober were really hard. But man... it was worth it.

"Thoughts on the disease model of addiction?
Curious what everyone's thoughts are on the disease model of addiction?

From what ive read, it seems AA/NA has pretty terrible sobriety rates, and they are a big proponent of the disease model. Having said that, I'm sure sobriety rates outside of the rooms are even worse. 

Is there any new research going on pointing to other causes for addiction other than disease?

My thoughts on the matter are: the disease model perpetuates a feeling of helplessness and offers the addict an excuse for his/her behavior that can end up being counterproductive. 

I assume we all feel pretty strongly one way or another on this topic, so I encourage thoughtful debate, but let's keep some form of civility.",

First time poster. I've had my bouts of sobriety and I've always fell out. Well i'm at day 4 of self detox.

For me at least, it is what I lack and crave most above all. when I fall out of that touch with friends and family, i get lost. Here's to another try with new ideology and deeper insight.

"Has anyone had difficulty finding themselves after getting clean?
I have been sober from heavy Xanax use for almost a year now, but I still feel like I am adjusting to sober life. I have a hard time socializing and finding joy in things I normally love. I am constantly over-analyzing situations and get tripped up on the ""normal"" way to act or respond. In turn, this had made me much more introverted and shy than I actually am. I try to shake it off, but my confidence level just isn't what it used to be. The Xanax made me very indifferent about things and now I feel like I'm constantly being judged by others. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

"Transgender and in recovery.
For context, I got sober before coming out and have been a member of the same group for nearly 4 years.

 I'm the first transgender person at my group. Overall, other members have been accepting and welcoming. After all, I'm just a person who wants to hear and carry the message like anyone else.

However, there are also members who seem to think that because I'm trans, it's okay to treat me differently than everyone else. Just today I was demeaned during a meeting. I've been sexually harassed and assaulted by men in the group, and my sense of belonging has been thrown into question. 

 Sobriety is the most important thing to me. The sense of being a part of, rather than the center of or apart from has been a huge factor in my recovery. I've voiced my concerns and feel like I'm basically on my own in dealing with this. I have the same right to recovery as anybody else, and the only positive thing I can think to do is stick around and try to make it a safer more welcoming place for someone like me in the future. 

This is my first post here, and I just need to get this off my chest. If anyone has some advice as to how I should handle situation I'd very much appreciate it.

"Had 30 months clean and Sober. I'm back inside the rabbit hole once again and trying to dig myself back out...
I was an IV heroin addict for many years.  I finally hit a really bad rock bottom and got sober and stayed sober for 2 and a half years, roughly 30 close to 31 months of sobriety.  Long story short.  I got complacent, fucked off on my program, and a bunch of people that were really close to me all went out and they all died.  Every single one of them.  None of them even made it past the age of 27.  Only one who died a few weeks after his 28th birthday and a week after his 4 year sobriety birthday.  It really fucked with my head.  These were guys with like 4-6 plus years of sobriety.  One of them was my sponsor.  I was completely and totally dry for the last 7 months of my sobriety before going back out.  After my first time using in 2 and half years I ended up in the hospital and was told by the nurse I had overdosed on heroin and was found border line dead and unresponsive in the middle of the street.  Signed myself out of the hospital and that was just the beginning of the insanity.  For the next few months I found myself back to square one.  In a place I never though I'd be.  Strung out, spending loads of money on needles and drugs, looking like filth and death and smelling like the stench of death.  Its like all the old timers who go back out had told me and warned me for ages, ""You start where you left off"" and that's exactly what happened.  It almost blows my mind away at how fast everything unraveled from the time of my first relapse in 
2 years to being in the spot that I am now.  At times I find myself over analyzing and going into random deep thoughts in the back of my mind as to why I am still alive and here?  Did god give me some kind of purpose?  Why did four very close friends of mine in recovery all go out and die and I'm still here standing?  Since my relapse I've ended up in the ER/hospital multiple times from countless overdoses, even had an incident where I fell out from a dose bigger than my body could handle which caused me to nod out and fall down my entire stair case(made entirely out of wood) only to wake up a couple hours later at the bottom of the stairs with minimal injury, mainly on my ankles, and other close encounters with death that I don't really need to list.  Sometimes it doesn't make sense.  But what I am starting to sense is that during this entire chapter I thought I was a cat with nine lives but in reality I was just playing russian roulette and my bad luck would eventually run out.  Nothing good came out of this relapse.  Yeah sure I got high and enjoyed it quite a bit.  But that little bit of enjoyment is not worth the heavy load of pure hell that comes with the territory of addiction.  I just basically wanted to get this out there that I need help.  I've been lurking this sub reddit for quite sometime now.  This is my first time posting here.  I'm just struggling big time and I want out of this terrible life.  I'm trying to get through this rodeo with out the need of detox/rehab like my other countless attempts.  I just try to remind myself that there was a time when I was happy and somewhat content in my life when I was knee deep into my recovery/sobriety.  It just sucks being inside the rabbit hole once again and trying to dig myself back out.  I don't want to end up like another statistic and end up dead like so many of my close pals.  I want to stop, but I can't.  But I want to.  Anyways I will shut up now.  I appreciate this sub reddit big time and thanks for taking the time to read my rant.....",
"Long time heavy stimulant abuser here. Trying to kick the stuff, and currently going through withdrawal for the first time ever.
TL;DR: I really just want someone to talk to and relate with. You should really read the whole thing. 


Hey everybody,

I have been abusing stimulants daily (Adderall IR) for the past 3 years. Had a horrific first time experience with methamphetamine, and I am now trying to kick all of it for good. 

When I started using Adderall I would take 40mg and be good to go the entire day, now Im to the point where I will take 400-500mg daily just to notice a buzz. My tolerance is insanely high and has been for awhile, but that's not what pushed me over the edge and made me want to stop.

A few weeks ago I tried street methamphetamine, because why not? I'm already taking absurd amounts of dexamps, how much worse could it be?

I really want to emphasize this next part, because I found out just how much fucking worse it could get.

I ordered a tiny amount on the internet just to try it out, it was a 4th of a gram or less. Once I got it, I spent the next 36 hours feeling like superman. I had really never felt like that. There was such a unique and warm boost in confidence that I never found with Adderall. I felt like I was in love. I went back online and ordered a quarter ounce of the highest rated product I could find, with express shipping of course. What comes next is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.

I sat down at my computer and started taking oral doses of the stuff. I didn't stop until it was all gone 6 days later. I stayed up for 6 fucking days straight doing nothing but meth and playing video games. Over that entire period of time I ate maybe 1000 calories. I tried to drink water regularly, put I probably only ended up drinking 2 glasses per day.

3 days into this binge I began hallucinating and having serious delusions. I would have some insanely vivid hallucination going on in my video game, and 10 minutes later I would snap back into reality to my teammate saying ""what the fuck are you doing/talking about?"". I specifically remember playing a zombie defense game and being terrified because I thought the zombies had taken my mom and my girlfriend hostage and kept sending me photos of them (you can laugh at that, I won't be offended). Over the next 3 days these hallucinations and delusions started getting longer and more intense. I wonder what it would have gotten to if I hadn't ran out.

When I was finally out, I crashed. Hard. It turns out that staying up for 6 days straight doing drugs without eating or taking care of yourself at all is tough on your body. The first thing that hit me was the smell. I reaked of feces, piss, and body odor. I puked multiple times just from my smell, and I had to air out my room for days. I took a shower and crashed on my couch for about 14 hours.

When I woke up, which is now about 3 days ago, I couldn't believe how horrific I felt. I must have sat there crying for 5 or 6 hours before I even attempted to get up. When I stood up for the first time I blacked out and I'm not entirely sure how long i was out for. I ended up ordering a pizza and some appetizers and devouring them. Then I made it to my bedroom and got into bed. I've been laying here sleeping or watching shows for the last 72 hours. I've missed the first 3 days of university due to barely being able to lift my head. The entire experience of this binge haunts me, and I have sworn to stay away from any of this stuff for the rest of my life.

I am 72 hours sober now and withdrawaling. I feel completely hopeless and don't even want to exist right now. I spend as much time as I can sleeping, but the rest of the time has been filled with spirals of deep depression and self hatred. I haven't had any craving for stimulants yet, but I'm so afraid that withdrawal is just going to keep getting worse to the point where I will cave in and start using again just to make it stop. 


I guess what I'm looking for right now is a little hope. I just want to hear someone tell me I can do this. I just want to hear some similar experiences and relate to other people who have gone through something similar and made it out the other side okay.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I hope someone is able learn a few things from my mistakes. 

Believe everything they've ever told you about methamphetamine. It is that bad.

Wish me luck.",
"Hi, IAMA Pharmacy Technician... And an addict
Hello, I am a Pharmacy Technician. I hold a bachelor’s degree in computer science (The job search has not produced any results). I am, relatively speaking, successful. So, why am I here? I’m an addict and I’m going to layout some details of my story. 

My problem: Tylenol #3. There are blind spots all over the pharmacy. I chose a high volume, no-audit, schedule four pain killer as my vice because when they notice, if they ever notice, I’d be long gone. However, my job search isn’t going well. I keep going down this rabbit hole, and like Alice, I never stopped to think how I would get out again. I know the answer is getting out of my current environment.

My Job: But, what makes a good technician go bad? I’ve asked this to myself many times over the last two years. We are not without a lack of tales where technicians turn and they succumb to addiction or stealing. Is it the company politics? Is it the low wage and hours? The asshole managers? The shitty customers? A combination of these things probably has played a part. Most of all, in my case, it’s my fault.

So, that leads to why did I do it: I told myself I would do whatever it took to graduate from college early. I meant whatever it took. My girlfriend kept pushing me to limits I never thought myself capable of. She wanted me to graduate early and “move on” with my life. She placed a high value on my education, my potential earnings, and not really anything else. She told me she would do it for me, even though I would never ask for that. So, here I was taking eighteen to twenty credit hour semesters, I was working 30 hour weeks, I was pushing summer classes, I was making Dean’s List, I paid all my debt, and all that happy shit. My girlfriend doesn’t even realize my habit and doesn’t realize that I kept telling myself if I failed any of my classes I’d jump off the parking deck. My depression has since passed, as that obviously wasn’t induced by the addiction part, but the pressure portion. I probably used the addiction to cope with that depression as well. School seemed futile at the time.

Debt free, sure. However, what price did I really pay? I had (still have) no social life. I kept myself going through my addiction. I needed sleep? Tylenol #3. I needed to push through a night? Tylenol #3. I needed to focus and couldn’t? Tylenol #3. Rough morning and late classes? You guessed it! Now, you’re probably wondering how that helped in all those cases. 

""I said I was an addict. I didn't say I had a problem. I pay my bills, I make my meals. I function."" -House, MD

Well, opiates are a funny thing, aren’t they? They don’t affect everyone the same. They don’t make me sleepy, lethargic, or distracted. They clear the pain, they terminate anxiety, it really feels like my brain is firing on all pistons, and I could be relaxed enough to sleep if I needed. Like I said, you’d never know by looking at me or my life that I would have a habit. **I’ve never been more productive in my life when I’m on this shit, and that’s why I became hooked.** No one suspects the honors students, but I honestly think they should. I realized early on in that this was not a sustainable habit. I would eventually get caught or die (heart attack, overdose, etc. I thought of it all). I would lay in between large schedule gaps with my classes, in the backseat of my car, in a deserted section of the parking garage, staring at the ceiling high off codeine to pass the time. Whatever I needed, wherever I was, it helped me get through it.

I’ve also been very careful of my habit and who I hurt. So far, I’ve only stolen from my company. I hurt only a morally bankrupt company. But that’s a lie, isn’t it? I hurt myself. I’ve lied to my friends and family. I’ve broken my moral compass. I’ve grayed the lines between what I perceived as right and wrong. I went through an identity crisis. I became a nihilist (Note: Not all nihilists are morally bankrupt, that’s just the way I turned out).

Why am I here now? I’m job hunting. I’m scared of losing my job. I’m scared of losing everything, really. When loss prevention comes in, I am always nervous as fuck, and they never pull me. I’ve never told anyone. I told myself I would take this as a secret with me to the grave. And I’m getting emotional writing this part in particular, because I have no support. Addicts are vilified, but I don’t have what it takes to keep it a secret anymore. I want help, but I also wanted this to be my burden alone.

And then my worst fear happened. Shortly after I graduated. The pharmacist came back too quickly. Tylenol #3 bottle in hand. No prescription on my screen. My sleight of hand wasn’t quick enough to pocket the amber vial I had just filled, but I did! And they acted like they had seen nothing! I know you saw! I wish you would have said something! Anything! I wish you would have taken me to the back! Scolded me outside of work! I don’t know! I know you think you’re protecting me, you're my friend, I wonder if you think I would lie to you, but I wouldn’t have. Even if I did, you’re allowed to search me, on the spot. And I needed so desperately to tell someone.

I told my best friend just last week by sharing about ten journal entries I had written over the last year about this struggle. Everything was there. I was expecting to be outcast. Vilified. Whatever the punishment. And all she said was **I wish you would have told me sooner.** Blew my fucking mind, man. 

And now I’m here. Interview coming up next week. Only two days since I stopped, but I thought I might feel better by telling my story. To be honest, the anger I have toward myself is helping with my withdrawal much more than APAP or NSAIDs are. I’ve been avoiding alcohol as an analgesic due to my concern that I might develop a dependence on it too.

So, I’m doing it. I’m ending my cycle and I know you guys can too. I hope my story can spark discussion on the pressures of modern life and how to cope in a healthy way. School just isn’t worth it. Take your time and try enjoy your life. If it takes five or six years to graduate, then so be it. Don’t do what I did.

Don’t let other people take control of your life.

Don’t let substance abuse take control of your life. 

You are in control of your life.

And I wanted to end by saying we’re in this fight together, and **we’re not alone as I once thought I was.** I assure you.

"The dope demon is at it again. Fucker.
Insomnia is kicking my ass. I've had 3.5 hours of sleep in the last 24 hours. Hot flashes, tossing and turning. Husband gets up with me. I'm almost in tears cuz I want to sleep so bad. I yell at him, ""Why?"" and his beautiful insight kicks in. He says, ""It's pay day tomorrow. If you don't sleep, then you twitch. If you twitch, then you have a super handy excuse to use."" He brought me the step book and said, ""read chapter one. You'll fall asleep then."" It was silly, but a way to remind me why I'm going through this shit. I have issues. Sleep anxiety, fear. Lots of fear. He is going to stand by as my sentinel. Let me feel safe for a minute. Long enough to fall asleep. That Damn dope demon. He's for my number. But I'm going to beat him. Fingers crossed I get through the next couple of days.",
"Am I still an asshole?
Am I an asshole?...sure I am. Just because I took the drugs away (as of now) doesn't mean I'm not an asshole. It does mean I'm much less of an asshole (in general, but still have my days). Look, over 22 years of drug use versus 4 years and 2 months clean...the math just doesn't add up to saint status. Stopping using drugs was only the beginning of treating my addiction. Eventually I saw what everyone with substantial clean time said to me--that drugs are but a symptom of the real problem...me. Drugs were my solution, and left to fend without them makes for an interesting, and sometimes volatile, life. The life of the lesser asshole...that's me right now. However, by continuing to practice what I learn from the NA program, staying teachable, and not picking up that first one, I have the chance to fix any asshole mistakes. If i would put a drug in me and all bets are off, self-centeredness and destruction are sure to ensue. There are some damaging behaviors that I rarely, if ever, do anymore and then there's ones that rear their ugly head once in awhile. My sponsor made this clear...once I do one of those behaviour again it's no longer an old behaviour, it's a current one. And though I say addiction is not about the drugs, make no mistake about it, returning to our old behaviors and thoughts will lead me to use again, which will lead only one of 3 places. If I'm lucky, jails and institutions, I'm thinking more chance of death though. It’s just awesome I have a choice today to not pick up. We do recover. ",

"The Fifth White Chip
Yesterday, I picked up my fifth white chip. In Narcotics Anonymous, we use a chip system to denote how much clean time one has. The chips symbolize that you are gambling with your life when you pick up drugs. They vary in color, as you accumulate more clean time. The first chip you pick up is the white chip. It signifies surrender to a new way of life. It tells all the addicts in the room that you admit you are powerless over your addiction to drugs; you’ve come to terms with the fact that your life had become unmanageable and are ready to take the first step towards recovery.

After I surrendered for the fifth time, I got a huge bear hug from a fellow NA member that I consider a big brother. He always dons a healthy envy-worthy tan and is usually dressed in cargo shorts, sneakers, and a simple t-shirt. He calls me “kid.” After meetings, my big brother hangs around to “fellowship” with the other addicts. He says this is the key to staying clean. Once he stood with me in the parking lot of a church for hours, until the clock stroke midnight, just to help me stay clean for that one day.

“Kid, you did good today. Keep coming back till you get it,” he says with a big toothy grin.

I’ve relapsed four times since I got out of rehab on March 1st. I had 90 days clean when I relapsed the first time. The day I received my red 90-day chip, I got a round of applause from my NA family. On my way back to my seat, I was greeted with warm hugs and congratulated with excited high fives from the only people who have ever understood me. For everyone in that room, I had accomplished something worth celebrating. But inside, I didn’t feel victorious. As great as it was to reach enough clean time that I graduated from one chip to the next, I had arrived at 90 days with many reservations.

Feeling like a fraud, I went out and picked up. I took one bump of coke and was immediately lifted out of my dark foggy depression. Coke has always had a way of putting me on top of the world. Without it, I’m nobody. The problem is it’s never just one bump. Soon after that first twenty, the high runs out of steam and I quickly fall back into the deep well where I am trapped most days. Because it never ends well, you’d think it’d be easy to stop. But my brain doesn’t remember the bad part. It only focuses on the one good moment and chases that dream until I destroy myself.

I’ve played the tape in my head over and over, recounting how I relapsed this last time. I thought I was doing all the right things; taking as many of the suggestions as I could about how to live clean. But there I was, peeling out of a meeting to jump on the expressway and dialing my dealer on the way. They say that when you have a burning desire to use, you should reach out and share where you’re at with a fellow addict. We’re encouraged to get numbers and actually call people. The therapeutic value of one addict helping another is without parallel. But my addiction has been active for over 25 years, way before I even picked up my first drug. That old habit of isolating, rationalizing and giving in to an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness are deeply embedded in me. I’m scared I won’t be able to overcome this pattern I’ve grown accustomed to. I’m afraid I’ll never learn to love Karen enough to give her a fighting chance. They say it takes 66 days to break an old habit. If I do all the right things and work the program the correct way, I should be able to make this the last white chip I ever pick up.  ",
"My first payday without picking up in...3 years?
So over the holiday last weekend I blew through $600 in cocaine with my SO. Maybe that wouldn't be a problem if it were an isolated incident.

Every weekend (and some weekdays), we have progressed in usage until we were going through at least an 8ball every weekend (teener on the weekdays). We have good jobs, but not good enough to support that habit and still pay the mortgage and other bills. 

We've been doing this for three years. I'm tired. I'm tired of being too tired on Saturday and Sunday to do anything. I'm tired of having to scrimp our way through the week. I'm tired of paying the mortgage late. So I decided to quit.

SO wasn't very supportive at first. He told me I was too far gone to stop, and that I wouldn't be able to go a whole weekend without picking up. But here I am -- it's Friday. I have money in my bank account and $400 cash in my wallet, and exactly no blow on my mirror. I actually ate dinner tonight. 

And I'm 30% happy for myself, 50% bored, and 20% miserable. I can't promise that I'll make it through the weekend, hell, I'm just trying to make it through tonight. Send me your good vibes please. ",
"Dying sober
Hitting bottom while sober
I won’t headline this as Hitting bottom while in recovery because I really haven’t been a participant in actual recovery as outlined in the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous for a while now. I don’t know where it started. I don’t know when I started leaving AA or when I stopped doing the things that healed me in the first four or five years of my recovery. It was gradual. I started leaving AA one judgement and one resentment at a time. I created problems in my home group around 2009. Through selfishness and self-centeredness I had actually started creating problems as early as 2007 when I became obsessed with a girl in Alanon. 
Listening to an AA speaker today by the name of Bob Darrell, and he says that surrender means we have to surrender the judgement of how our life is supposed to go. I hang on to things that I think I should have in my life, and it is like saying, “okay God, I turn my will and my life over to your care, but here is a list of things that I expect to receive in return.” When Bob Darrell said that, I immediately knew it was true in my own life. I still think I know what is best for me. I have judgements of how my life is supposed to be, and maybe I have been setting the bar too low – I don’t know. 
What I do know is that I am homeless once again. I am getting kicked out of my apartment. To be honest, I have been getting kicked out of this place ever since I moved into it. 
I believe that my depression and my alcoholism try to keep me in a constant state of dissatisfaction, and I make poor decisions – usually ones that revolve around some type of instant gratification – that go against God’s will and cause major problems later on. Some call it fear of success, some call it fear of responsibility, I think it is just a lack of discipline coupled with low self-esteem. 
I have come to a place in sobriety where I do not feel comfortable with the status quo of just being sober, and without doing the things that I did in the first years of sobriety, I end up making choices based solely on self. This has brought me to a place in my sober life where I go to the bar and order a drink. I look at the shot of whiskey. I smell the shot of whiskey, and then I give it to the person next to me and walk out. I am too much of a sissy to drink the whiskey, for fear that I will have to reset my sobriety date. The truth is, I don’t think it will help me, so I go home and I put a gun to my head, but I am too much of a sissy to pull the trigger. So I am constantly living or dying in a pathetic existence where I cannot muster the courage to drink, and I cannot muster the courage to die either. 
I tell myself to “get busy living, or get busy dying,” but then I do the bare minimum to exist because I don’t believe that, if there is a God, that he or she really wants anything for me that I would want. 
It is like my life is a coloring book that God gave to me through his grace, and I purposely color outside the lines on every picture, or I don’t color them at all – waiting endlessly for a new book or at least some better crayons, not knowing that once I finish with this book, God might have a different one for me. 
My sobriety date is 4/17/2004 and I am dying from my disease. I am posting this because I don’t know what to do. I have lost my faith in a higher power.

"New App For People In Recovery
Hey everyone, I'm proud to announce Meeting Maker, an app I created and released yesterday. It's the world's first social/ridesharing app for people in recovery. People post if they're driving to a meeting, trying to get to a meeting, or walking (for those in the city). People local to them can search and connect with the poster, facilitating service work, meeting attendance, etc. Everyone appears to others as first name, last initial, so anonymity is maintained. It's free, and any profits from ad revenue (which was necessary to support the servers) will be donated to recovery-related organizations. 

Please check it out! It's available for Android and will be out for iPhone soon. And please spread the word: the more people that use it, the more people it can help. Even if you have your own ride, by posting on Meeting Maker you can help others get to meetings.

"My experience with rehab
**Introduction**

When I was contemplating treatment, I turned to Reddit to get information about what I should expect. I found the stories about rehab experiences to be very helpful in making my decision. The purpose of this posting is to provide information for people who are similarly situated. I won't say that I have all of the answers about treatment, but I have my own story, which is detailed below.

**Background**

I am in my mid thirties. I live in a large American city. I have a young family, a house, and a career. I also have a problem with alcohol. It reared its head about four years ago when I rather quickly converted from semi-heavy casual drinking to excessive drinking. I had my first foray with getting clean about three years ago. There are a few reasons why that didn't work out. For one, I didn't believe I was an alcoholic. I never really committed to getting clean. I didn't want to or think I needed to. I switched back to casual drinking after a little while. That worked for a little while, until it didn't.

Before coming into treatment, I was drinking approximately 12 to 15 units of alcohol per day, almost all of it in the evening. It made me physically sick. Toward the end, I struggled to keep solid food down. I woke up every morning in a panic, vomiting past the point where I had anything left in my stomach. I felt horrible most of the time.  I was drinking just to maintain, and in retrospect, I was barely maintaining at all.

Through it all, I was able to maintain my job and my family. I was ""functional,"" despite the hell I was going though on a daily basis. I probably could have continued for a while longer. I had a lingering thought for a while along the lines of ""This isn't going to end well."" Then one day I had what some people call a moment of clarity. I had enough. I knew I needed treatment, and I needed it soon. I was done.

**Seeking Treatment**

I started my research on treatment. I searched online extensively, had two different evaluations (which both recommended inpatient treatment), and checked what my insurance would pay for. My family was less than thrilled when the extent of my use came out, but they were supportive when it came down to it.

I decided on a thirty day facility on the rural outskirts of a major metropolitan area. It looked pretty nice from the website. The reviews were generally positive, and the intake staff was helpful on the phone. I settled my affairs as best as I could. I packed my bag and headed into the unknown.

**The First Few Days**

The reality of treatment hit hard once I got there. I handed off my belongings and said my goodbye. The staff brought me to a small room where I was stripped searched. I cried during the intake interview. I was alone in a new place. Staff escorted me to the detox portion of the facility, where I would spend the bulk of my next five days.

The nursing staff gave me a number of medications on a regular basis to aid with my detox. Probably the most important was Librium. It took away the  shakes and helped a lot with anxiety. It also made me sleepy. I also took medication to prevent seizures, lower my blood pressure, help me with sleep, and aid with depression (I've had issues with depression in the past and came in with a prescription). I was assessed at regular intervals. My detox was comfortable, and I didn't have any medical issues.

I got to know other patients in detox during those first few days. I was initially put off by the younger crowd, almost all of whom were there for opiate addiction. Others slept the bulk of the time. I did my share of sleeping, but I also walked around, checked out the facility, and talked to people. The others patients were generally supportive. 

The facility kept to a pretty strict schedule. Meals were served at specific times. Groups were held on a regular basis at specific times. Patients were expected to attend everything. Staff let people slide during their stay in detox, but I came around rather quickly. I wanted to do stuff and get better.  

**The People**

The patient demographics at a treatment facility will vary considerably based on a lot of factors. At the place where I went, everyone there had private insurance. It was almost all white. At least half of the people there were under 25 and addicted to opiates. They were wise beyond their years, in the sense that many have had guns pointed in their faces and saw their friends die of overdoses. But they were also immature. Most didn't care about the rules. A lot didn't want to be there. Some were there because their parents didn't know what to do an just dropped them off. Others went to treatment to gain an advantage in their pending legal case. The phrase ""Junky Summer Camp"" was used a lot.

Luckily, the kids weren't interested in me, and I wasn't interested in them. I gravitated toward people similar in age to me. They also had a track for people in my demographic: semi-functioning alcoholics in their 30s and 40s who generally haven't lost everything (yet) as a result of their substance abuse. I was placed with that track for the bulk of my treatment.

The majority of staff were in recovery themselves. I never had a problem with them, but I also followed the rules, as ridiculous as I thought some of them were. Other people were more perturbed by them. I didn't mind getting up on time, making my bed, and showing up to the things I was supposed to go to.

**Treatment**

As I mentioned earlier, the schedule was rather strict. Meals were served at regular times (the food was pretty good too). In the morning, we met with our small group and our primary therapist. I found this aspect to be the most helpful component of treatment. It gave me the opportunity to share my experiences and feelings with like-minded patients and my therapist. There would be three or four other groups throughout the day, mostly an hour long. Some were similar to small group in that it was a topic discussion with patient participation. Other components were lectures. They offered recreation therapy during some slots, but there was the option to do other things if you didn't want to play volleyball or go on a walk, etc. At night there were mandatory AA or NA meetings. After 8:30 or so, we had some free time before lights out. I also had individual sessions with a therapist about 2 or 3 times a week.

Some of the groups were good. Some were pointless and felt like we were just being babysat. I learned way more than I thought I would from the other patients. Many people had stories which were eerily similar to mine. Some people were in a much darker place as a result of their addiction, and I learned from them too. 

It was an emotional roller coaster being in treatment. I went from plotting my escape, to feeling like a helpless weakling who wasn't ready to leave, to feeling to content, to missing my family tremendously, and all over again. I felt sad at times. I felt anxiety. Real anxiety. I learned a lot about how to actually live with anxiety and other feelings rather than drinking them away. I grew close to my peers and really wanted them to get better. They felt the same about me. I laughed - really laughed. 

**Odds and Ends**

We were allowed about two 10-minute phone calls per week, as approved by your therapist. Family visits were offered once your loved ones completed a family education session. They were an hour long and were facilitated by a therapist (no privacy). I went off grounds only once during my stay to attend an off-site AA meeting. I was in a three person room with a rotating cast of patients. People came and went. Many did not complete the program. The population turned over almost completely throughout my stay. The food was pretty good. My financial obligation was minimal. People smoked lots of cigarettes.

**Conclusion**

I completed the program successfully after a month. Unlike a lot of the patients, I returned to my family. I feel very good. My mind is clearer than it has ever been. My health is good I am grateful for what I have. I have been attending outpatient treatment. I go to AA meetings, which I have grown to enjoy. Per the recommendations of clinical staff, I have a sponsor and a home group. I have an open mind and a motivation to stay clean.

I have a whole lot ahead of me, both in terms of repairing the damage I have done to myself and others, as well as my own growth. I don't want to return to my situation prior to treatment. Will I be sober my whole life? I don't know, but I'm not going to drink today. 

**Feedback**

I hope someone finds this post to be helpful, whether that person is lurker or an individual in recovery. I intend to keep it online for a while. I also plan on posting periodic updates.

Please feel free to send me questions or comments. If I get really good questions or repeat questions, I might edit my original response to address them.

"I need to hear some success stories of people who were heavily into smoking meth. I need some inspiration. Please help
28yo Male

I was a heavy user for 2.5 years, 6 months off followed by the last 6 months secretly on and off. 
I'm so much healthier physically now and can go a week without with not too much trouble. But in that week I am so so depressed.

Bad things are starting to creep into my mind.

I know that life is beautiful and amazing, but my fucking brain won't let me feel it anymore. I am scared.

There are so many horrible stories, I want to hear something positive. Please inspire me.

Sorry if this question has been asked a lot before, I kind of want something personal.
Thank You",
"6 years off drugs today (trigger warning...)
When I turned 18 I felt free from my religious family and rebelled HARD. I went from the parent-pleasing-never-doing-drugs-ever-kid that was a foreign exchange student and spoke fluent German to a meth, crack, and ""what else do you have?"" addicted prostitute ...within 6 months of my first time ever trying weed. 

I fell hard and fast and it all ended with my family hiring a private investigator to find me, an intervention, and me kicking drugs on my own in my grandmothers bed while she sat wondering if I was going to be screaming when I woke up. 

Its been 6 years since that day. I am now 25, married, and still sober. I have put the past behind me and I have a good life. 

But my family wont be congratulating me today. We don't talk about things like that in our family. Like my cousin that molested me when I was 6....thats never been talked about. Like my pastor said, ""we don't want a scandal in the church."" I guess actions speak louder than words......but what I need right now are some words! 

So congrats to everyone thats sober today! I am proud of you! I know its a struggle. 

Peace.

"Drank one in 11 months.
I am a blackout drinker/pill user. I love hallucinogens to the point where I go psychotic from use. I have tried to kill myself in a psychotic episode. This happened in 2009. I found AA in 2012. It took me two years to get relief from the steps. I have many AA chips. My depression and anxiety are gone. Ive been talking to people non-stop since it went away and I feel awesome. I was willing to talk about my weird sexual shit on my 3rd 4th step, which I have done before, but this time I made a surrender. 

I hope you guys get what happened to me. I feel great. I feel like anything is possible now. The depression and anxiety felt like a straight jacket between me and the world. Now I feel free! Good luck to all and God bless.",
"Even the support of ONE person can do wonders! One big factor that keeps me from relapsing. Unconditional love. <<33
So lately I've been thinking a lot about my mom and how she stuck with me during my use. I'll be driving and I think about her and I fight so hard not to cry. I'll be thinking about what to write for my personal statements and she'll pop up, and again I fight to not cry and look like an emotional wreck in front of people. F•k I'm about to cry now. 

Throughout my use, it was her that loved me unconditionally. She never stopped. She wrote me letters because I wasn't home at that time. She made sure I was still alive. She didn't know about the depths of my opiate addiction but she knows of almost everything else. 

She stood up for me. She was and is the only one that has faith in me. She cooked me eggs (don't want to eat something heavy) when I come home ridiculously late from studying and haven't eaten all day. I can see how tired she is but she cooks them for me. Always couple weeks close to testing days I never eat enough and lose weight too fast which she worries about. 

When my father was raising his hands to beat the living shit out of me she stood between us telling him to hit her instead of me. When he found my stash of xannies and after a major physical incident, I was ready to just leave like I did the first time. She bandaged up my cuts and scrapes. Put some medicine thing on my bruises. Bought another wrist brace because i lost my first One. She begged me not to leave and slept in front of my door, on hardwood floors so I don't go in the middle of the night for weeks. 

Don't get me wrong. My father is a hardworking business man. Very smart. I have respect for what he provided for me. I am honestly more blessed to have what i have. I've brought the pain to my family. My sisters tell me that the way I grew up and the way he was to me it wasn't fair. But I accept my responsibilities and the poor decisions I've made. 

How can I blame someone that doesn't know why I used. I've never told them the memories I blocked for so long. 

She approached my drug habits differently. My dad was physical and verbal but my mom calmly and gently encouraged me. Tried to understand addiction. The physical and mental wants of the drug. My dad had all rights and reasons to be angry. I don't blame him. 

But throughout all this, after every mistake I've made, all the anger, the fights, the tears, my mom hasn't given up on me. I would give my life for her to have had a better one. Not one with a daughter that brought nothing but pain. I was so selfish, such a brat. She does everything. She works along side my dad, cooks, cleans and as much as I contribute as much as I can like make dinner, clean, do laundry, take the trash out, etc... I haven't done enough. She deserves the world. I hope that one day I can be as strong and kind hearted as she is. I don't deserve her but I'm so happy and lucky to have her be my Mommie (yes I said Mommie, :) ). 

Almost eight years clean and though the journey was long, i feel that I can finally breathe. 

When I was a child, I once told her that I will be successful and buy her everything. My father can retire because he needs to now but can't. I can't change the past but i can work hard for my future. And once I'm stable, independent and able to I want them both to retire. Live a happy relaxing life they deserve. 

Tl;Dr: those that are mothers, thank you. For everything. <33

"Day one of no drinking...
For the passed three days I've benn binge drinking. Two whole bottles of wine at work yesterday. My boss is understandably very angry. My mom is furious. I feel worthless... I was on stopdrinking three months ago intending to stop and all I've done is managed to mess it all up countless times since then. I'm ashamed and everything is falling apart .... I'm sorry for ranting... I know I have no one to blame but myself. Has any one else felt so low? Was it a turning point at all? I'm 23 and I've managed to ruin what so many people think of me.",
"Another milestone in my journey...
My name is donthebeach and I am a compulsive gambler. No gambling to report. 
I spent about 5 years of my life gambling every penny I owned, I begged, borrowed and stole so I could fund my habit. I found the darkest corners of my mind and heart. Gambling ruined many relationships, my value of money, my mental health and my credit rating among many other important parts of my life. I have now been gambling free for just over 6 months. I went to GA for the first two months, this gave me the tools to fight this demon myself and the courage to talk about it with those who have stuck around for me. 
In 6 months I have learned more about myself than I have in 23 years. I am a better man, far from perfect but still a better man. I have found how much fun life can be when you are honest. I can't afford much, but what I can I appreciate so much more now. I will be in debt for at least a decade because of my mistakes but when that day comes that I pay off my last borrowed pound I will be the happiest man alive. 6 months may not seem like much to some people but this is the longest I have gone without placing a bet my entire life. Thankyou for listening.

"Four.
Four years ago, on my 31th birthday, an old friend came by the little shop where I was working and offered to smoke a joint. I said no thanks. I had been off the booze for a while, but had gone back to smoking pot, and it just wasn't working any more. 

After waiting a week, to make sure I was on my way, I got honest with my sponsor and my meetings about my sneaky behavior. With AA, a sponsor, and a bit of faith in something, I've been sober ever since. 

Thanks to everybody here, for their part in this story.",
"Any idea why my sponsor wouldn't be thrilled about me going to therapy?
I honestly don't get it. I will have 60 days on Sunday. I've been doing everything I'm supposed to do in my program. I go to at least one meeting a day. I call my sponsor every day. I do all my reading/homework and meet with her once a week. I am making friends in the program. I declared a home group. I drive other people to and from meetings when they need a ride. I meditate most mornings (honestly could be doing better with that.) 

My mom recently had a psychotic break and I have been doing a lot of research about her potential illness. In my search I came across diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder. It really hit home. I know I can't self diagnose but I'm almost certain I have it. I made an appt with my psychiatrist and spent hours calling psychologists until I found one that takes my insurance and specializes in BPD. I was proud of myself for being proactive.   

She told me that time would have been better spent reading my Big Book. That pissed me off. I do all my reading assignments. If I read ahead she makes me go back and reread anyway. I do believe the Big Book is valuable for maintaining sobriety and learning a better way to live. I do not believe it is a substitute for therapy if I do indeed have a personality disorder. I think they would complement one another nicely. I don't plan to use therapy as a substitute for my program. 

Furthermore I am a survivor of a lot of trauma: childhood sex abuse, rape as an adult, and an ectopic pregnancy that almost killed me. I've always needed therapy to deal with that shit and have always been too busy getting fucked up to do it. 

Why wouldn't she support this? I explained that I need therapy regardless of whether I have BPD. She said I need to make sobriety my first priority. I feel like I have been doing that. 

TL;DR: I think I have a personality disorder and need therapy for some past trauma. My sponsor thinks my time is better spent reading my Big Book. ",

"speaking at a meeting
Hey guys,
yesterday I was the speaker at a speaker meeting.
I was very happy that I was asked, but not sure if I could do it. But I asked for 3 weeks to prepare myself and did it.
It was an step one speaker meeting at a Clinique. I was really scared 25 people looking at me telling the story of my life as a teenage junkie. So I did not to talk about that. I just told them about my mom and dad being alcoholics and that my use had gone so out of control that I could not leave the house and I spent my time in a dark room, afraid of everything.

then I stared talking about recovery and how the obsession was lifted and there was room for other thoughts in my head.  And how everything in the world became slightly less scary and how simple life had gotten.

I was so scared  that I stuttered a couple of times. But I told the story about how this sub reddit send me to NA. and that at first I did not wanted to hear any of it. I just wanted to complain ore get a pill so I did not have to think about using any  more.  I was raving about NA only being in the US so I could not possible go because I am in The Netherlands. Then one of you send me a link with the Dutch meetings and I had to go.

I did not know what NA was I thought it was just a bounce of people talking about how much not  doing drugs sucked. Boy was I wrong.

I am writing this to this subreddit, because without you guys I would not be clean and alive right now. And to tell you that my experience as a speaker was amazing!!!! People toild me that my story was nice to hear and they found hope in it!!!! It was the biggest compliment I have ever had!
And I can recommend speaking on a speaker meeting to every one that has the chance!

"I get a year on Friday the 7th,2012.
I just wanted to tell someone how fucking stoked I am.  Almost a year ago I was addicted to painkillers and smoking weed.  My wife is currently 6 years clean from heroine and meth and she watched me go down the dark path that we both used to be on together.  I was never a pill head or heroine addict, although I enjoyed ALL drugs, but alcohol was my drug of choice.  I am a garden variety alcoholic.  I went to my first AA when I was 16 and some court ordered out-patient things when I was a teenager for getting arrested for drinking and weed.  I got arrested for drinking underage 7 times.  I drank as much as I could , I thought I was partying.  Started smoking crack, meth, and acid all by the time I was 18.  I was good in school and graduated from an alternative school with honors, got a scholarship to the community college that I dropped out of half way through semester.  Yada yada yada.  I drank and did drugs till I found recovery in November of 2005  and that was my last drink.  A couple of years ago I hurt my back started taking painkillers because I was in a miserable pain and I get hooked.  I then started taking them for boredom and I thought smoking weed would help me take less.  It didn't it just helped me get higher.  I had a herniated disk and it wasn't getting better so they did another MRI and found out I had a very large tumor on my kidney.  So after I had removed, I binged on my pain killers and the day I ran out was same day my wife said she was going to move out permanently.  I really had turned weed into crack, I couldn't stop I would wait till she went to sleep and then go smoke in my garage and then sit at my computer and be so scared that she was going to catch me again, it was really miserable.  Doing drugs in my marriage is a deal breaker.  I'm really glad my wife stuck it out with me, but I did really take it to the limit.  So I called some friends in recovery and they helped me get back on my feet and get sober again.  And I am really grateful today.  I just finished step 10 and have been working on step 11.  This isn't my first time going through the steps, but this time like every time you work the steps is better!

"Emotionally stunted from use
Hey fellow redditors in recovery. I have a little over a month in clean time and I’ve been dealing with something I don’t hear often in recovery, and that is a feeling of being emotionally stunted from long term use, specifically meth use. I began using at 16 and used for several years. I’m 20 now, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m still 16. It’s like all that time I was using was lost, and I’m having to learn everything about how to be an adult all over again. Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone have any insight into this? I just feel lost and like everyone is several steps ahead of me. I’m going to bring this up to my therapist in our next session - we’ve already talked a bit about it but I think it has become more of an issue for me personally recently. Thanks, this community is fantastic and I hope to stick with it. ",

Edit- I am mentally and physically exhausted from today. Didn’t make it to the hospital, but tomorrow it will be hospital or rehab. Still waiting to hear from the insurance company. Thank you all so much for all the comments and support. I’ve cried a lot today, but some of the relief tears were from reading the responses here.

I don't really relate to any of them beyond the base level that we all used to use drugs. One even tried to convert me recently lol.

"Guys help im bugging out and on the verge of relapsing
Im clean only 12 or 13 days. On top of the expected shittiness feeling of that, i just spent the day at the hospital because my father is suddenly having some significant mental problems. Severe confusion etc. He's already dying from liver cancer, which is hard enough on me, but him being like dementia tier mentally messed up is just another level of shittiness. Hes been out of it all week but not like this. Today was bad so i brought him in. Suddenly got very bad. 

Even disregarding this, im a mental wreck at the moment to begin with. This added just has me freaking out. Want to cry but too dead inside. Idk what to do about it at all. Doctors dont either at the moment. They don't know what's up. Keeping him overnight and will run some tests tomorrow, but it's not a liver thing. Would be better if it's a liver thing honestly. Idk. Im in my 20s and basically handling this/him alone. I cant take it...  

Guys im just bugging out. I have easy access to excess legit opiates,  due to father's cancer. I dont want to do them, especially because of how shitty i JUST felt detoxing/still feel, dont even want to get high, but i just want some relief and sleep. I dont want to do any, but im afraid i will once i get home. 

Idk what to do about anything.

Edit:

 just wanted to say thanks to everyone. I chilled out. Im NOT gonna use opiates. I just keep telling myself that theyll only make everything so much worse, and as shitty as i felt today id feel even shittier tomorrow. Withdrawal really is a great scare tactic. Dont want to go through any of that shit again. Thankfully that is still fresh on my mind.

Mostly all of my clean time is due to rehab and a halfway house but I am now trying to get involved more in the fellowship outside those things. It's hard for me however, as I'm sure it has been for others, I am a very self\-conscious person and rather dislike myself and all the things that come with years of use but I'm working to correct those patterns of thinking. I find it hard to share at meetings, I haven't actually shared yet at one outside of the rehab.

"Fragile
I have been illicit drug free for 2.5 years with the help of MMT program.  I honestly felt like I have this problem in check.  While I would never be silly enough to think I was cured, but i really felt like I would never trade what I had to go back to using.

What I failed to be prepared for was what if I lost some or all of what I had.  To make a long story short I had a good job the last few years but the company is going through a rough patch. Starting the 1st of the year it no longer seems like a place to further my career. 

 I took a few interviews other places and got a offer letter from one and I accepted.  The only thing was I only had 16 days till they needed me to start, so I put my notice in at my current job and did the on boarding process and started my last 2 weeks. 

 7 days before I was supposed to start and my last day at my current job I get a call and they is a issue with my backround check and it says I'm a felon and since I didn't disclose it they will have cancel my offer.  While I was charged and plead guilty on a felony in 2011 after I did probation they dismissed the charges.  I was given the number to the background check company and told I could dispute the findings.

While I knewThat the charges were officially dismissed when I went in check the public record it didn't make it clear that that's exactly what happened.  So I came to the realization there is a good chance that I was going to be unemployed.
 
I completely lost it with this complete change in my life in the fact I was unsure of how to deal with this possibility.   I honestly felt like I might go get as fucked up as a possible and just overdose and be done.  I guess I never realized that my not using and what not had been so much easier when I didn't have to worry about taking care of my basic needs.  How with out this I was ready to relapse, I just didn't care anymore.

Saturday morning I found out that everything got figured out and I can still start Monday morning. (Fyi I didn't use)  I think I never realized that have a good job was such a huge part of my sobriety,  and how the second it was in jeopardy I didn't care anymore.  Its just such a reality check that if I can't have a chance to provide for myself in a healthy way that I'd be quick to revert to my addict ways.  

Sorry this is so long, thanks if you read it.
TL;DR I thought I was strong in recovery but faced with being unemployed it shook me to the core, started to plan relapse.",

Hello! I’m not sure if this post belongs here, but I found you all last night and I’m really glad I did. I am 105 days sober (alcohol and some related self-destructive behaviors). I’ve been really active over on stopdrinking, and now I’m seeking tools to live better in recovery. 

I have never been happier or healthier. Last night I cut ties with one of the most destructive people in my life, and wrote a long and cathartic email that helped me to see how far I have come...and how far I still have to go. I have gotten this far without any IRL support groups, but I am going to start attending meetings so I stay active in this change in myself, and so that I can try to help others.

Hey guys, I just joined this group, it's always great to see people in recovery. (: I struggled with drugs and alcohol since I was 15.

I finally checked myself into a rehab centre after many dope sicknesses passed and desperate moments happened. Now I'm 21 and this has been the longest I've ever been sober.

I also have scoliosis so I'm usually in pain (my long term morphine rx for my twisted back is what led to my heroin addiction) so sober life is also uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I am fully committed to staying clean...its just that adjusting to life without that crutch is a lot harder than I thought it would be. ",
"one of my coworkers was fired today, for smoking meth.... And i’m pissed off
I’m heated! 

Yet i don’t know why. 

I’m 180+ days clean and im pretty much miserable. I’m actually just as miserable as i was on day 1. I’ve *really* been considering using because  i just can’t take this overall...i don’t know ....monotony of it all. I’m aggravated and dissatisfied with life 

but fast forward to right now, so i worked with him (my coworker)  often and i really liked him we always had long talks about him and his girlfriend. His son had a slight mental disability and compulsively facetimes him at least 5 or 6 times a day. And he answered that phone every damn time. He really loved his kid and i thought he was a really good guy which i still think he’s a good guy, just he got into some bad things. 

Color my stupid ass surprised  when i find out he got fired for driving the company van high and starting a fist fight with another coworker when he got caught smoking meth at a company event. 

I refused to believe it. I just couldn’t believe how he just slid under the radar like that. right in front of *me* you know? I was on heroin for 2.5 years and absolutely no one knew until i started telling people (only my friends and dad know. No one else knows) , luckily i got myself together before it started to show. 

ANYWAY, i think i’m mad because *HE WAS RIGHT THERE* you know? someone to talk to someone who could relate to me, i absolutely wish we could have had a conversation or two about addiction and getting help. I’m really upset because i didn’t pick up on a thing. i could have helped him, he could have helped me. 

Now he’s sitting in jail somewhere. And that angers me even more. I know in the grand overall scheme i probably couldn’t have stopped any of those things from happening but...i feel like i could have done more.

This second video is just a few tips for those new in recovery, some things that helped me. Again this is all personal opinion, I can only tell you what helped me. I hope it can help someone else.

"Lost a friend today
She was my friend and my roommate and she was coming up on five years.  I found her dead in her bathtub this morning with her throat slit.  

I've heard it said in AA not to kill yourself in the first five years because you don't know the person you are killing.  

This shit is nothing to fuck with.  I've been sober long enough to have buried a few people.  I have never buried one that was working with others, working the steps, going to meetings, doing service.  

Please do the work.",
"Hello Sober World!
My sobriety date is 12/3/16. This is me reaching out to become a part of the sober community. I'm working on getting involved on a local level as well. I've spent the last few months gathering myself and doing as much slow healing as possible. I'm feeling a need for some sober fellowship at this point :) it's time to show the world my face!

I'm not sure if I have anything to say, really... it's just great to know that this Subreddit exists!! :)

"Unexpected documentary I found on Netflix that was a game changer for me
Hi guys, I  stumbled across this documentary that helped me in recovery and some of you might be interested in checking it out. I have been having trouble with building up my life again after relying on pills as a crutch.  

This documentary doesn't directly have anything to do with drugs or recovery, but is about the phenomenon of how humans have lost touch with their awareness, with intuition, with their bodies, with their senses, with nature, with their ability to go on a journey with a real risk of failure, and their ability to make sense of things appearing to be chaos, etc.


These are things that I am dealing with now that I have taken drugs out of my life. I was protected and numbed from these things with my blanket of opiates around me at all times.


Anyway, it's called ""Innsaei: The Power Of Intuition"". Let me know what you guys think  and good luck on your recoveries! :)",

"To the Alcoholic Parents with Children
To the alcoholic parents with children,

Your kid is not ok.

I repeat, your kid is not ok.

It is with such fervor, compassion, longing, fear, terror, empathy, and understanding that I implore to listen.

I am 24, but 17 years of my life was surrounded by such chaos, discord, discontent, and suffering that I need to explain. To rationalize, to distract, to diffuse, to live, I hope my experience may shed light and save someone else.

I grew up in a family of four with very supportive, loving, and caring parents. They taught me to respect, be kind, love myself as well as others, and that I could accomplish anything I set my mind to. From the outside, we seem like a relatively normal, loving, and prosperous family. Parents had good jobs that often facilitated me to pursue my dreams. However, there is something that you cannot see from the outside. A façade so beautifully constructed that it eluded to be seen. Pull back that veil and you will see some of the ugliest, brutal, chaotic, and dysfunctional cloud of noxious emotion that was my life. You know as a kid I didn’t understand. Seeing my parents drink at night didn’t hold this importance or weight that was later burdened. It was very normal for Mom and Dad to fall asleep on the couch. They worked hard and were just tired. In a daze from a nightmare I would seek out the help of my parents to be comforted. I went to my Mom on the couch who was in a sleep so deep a blackout could only have caused. I tried to wake her quite often with a resulting scream of surprise that did not quite lift. She’d tell me to go back to bed, slurring words of understanding and help. To which followed an even deeper state of unconsciousness. Of course, none of this was remembered in the morning. Everything was A -Ok in the morning. Entire conversations at night would drift away from existing. None of it mattered because they were listening to more often than not forget. To me their nightly activities transformed them into hollow shells of beings screaming for help. Each night I’d fill these shells with my life and thoughts and wishes. As morning dawned those shells fell and took with them all of the night before.

Then there were the fights. Oh god, were there fights. “I fucking hate you, you piece of shit”, “We should have never gotten married”, “I never wanted kids”, “Why don’t you ever fucking listen to me”, “You don’t give a fuck about this family and I hate you for it”. These words like a mass of electrons with a need to explode and direct toward a grounding source that was facilitated by a cloud of high conductivity made up of concentrated ethanol hanging in the air. You see while at first I did my best to ignore this. Hide in my room turning up my music so loud to drown them out. But with a frequency and magnitude of unnatural amounts perpetuated with hate, malice, and chaos it became harder to ignore and harder to escape. I felt helpless, trapped, angry, and sad because deep down I could not help them. Kids in alcoholic families find ways to cope, escape, and shelter themselves from this abuse. There is no rational, healthy, or easy way to live in this environment. Quite often you see kids rebel and cause trouble. The “Fuck All” attitude that pushes them away and separates them from the family. Ironically, kids with this response make it out less unscathed than their counterparts. I was not one of those. I set upon myself the unasked responsibility to keep my family together. It is a sort of task that is never asked, never solicited, but always taken, to accomplish the impossible. Bring back my family. Keep us together. Imagine you are playing a game of Jenga and the tower is spread so incredibly thin that one single piece is preventing the whole thing from crashing down. Only you see, I was that piece. I reinforced, restructured, amended, and held on for dear life. The family was a huge island built upon tectonic plates so volatile and unpredictable that every reasonable expectation was that it break and separate from what a once whole piece it started as. I get asked sometimes how I have such a great sense of humor, how I make others feel comfortable, how approachable and understanding I am, and with such ease I make new friends. This was how I coped and after seventeen years of practicing I became pretty damn good at it. However, this was not fostered by choice. The preface and necessity that fostered this learning was not from a good place. When everything was about to come crashing down I would swoop in to save, separate them, console them, calm them down, fuck just distract them. It was like pulling two rabid dogs apart to feed them treats. I used humor and entertained them if only for a couple hours to diffuse the situation, to distract the gaze of those dogs, to separate, to calm, to fix, to bandage, what happened every night. I was the shoulder to cry on, I was the vessel to redirect this hate so as to pull its attention away from each other. It is not by chance that I became good at this. It was out of necessity that I learned these skills. The thing that hurts the most is that all of this, everything I did, the effort put forth with every fiber of my being, was washed away as the sun rose, simply and with such ease forgotten. Washed away as their minds cleared and healed. None of it ever happened. So I carried on as this silent soldier of hope. You see this soldier did not come out of war unscathed. I wish for no one to go through this. Which is why I’m writing this. I want to reach out to those like my parents. Beneath those smiles and persistent confirmations of content and well being there is something insidious building. Something that will not be escaped or healed without action.

You are not the only one who suffers. Your afflictions are shared not isolated. This will lead to a disaster. Head my words, digest them, think of someone besides yourself and seek help.

Sincerely,

A now alcoholic son with alcoholic parents.

"Gifts of sobriety
Next week I will be celebrating 4 years clean and sober. Traditionally my mother plans a visit at the end of October every year (God willing) to present me with my medallion at the treatment facility I attended....This morning I received a text from her stating that I needed to call because she had to talk to me about something - (Being the addict that I am, my mind immediately goes to ""worst case scenario"".) Come to find out, my sister in law and 2 nephews want to come as well and stay with me for the week. Why does this mean so much? Because in active addiction no one wanted to be around me let alone let their children (my nieces and nephews) build any sort of relationship with me.... For me the gifts of sobriety are not just about the job, the car, the money - Sure that's all nice too but....It's about Family & being able to re-build relationships with the people who mean the most to me. Those are truly the best gifts! 

Thanks for letting me share! ",
"Trust me, the depression & anxiety improve every day.
Dear Depression,
Please know I miss you. Do not think I have forgotten you. It’s been so long. Life can get hectic, we all get busy. However, not a single day goes by without me thinking about you. How can I forget about someone who has played such a pivotal part in my life? You’ve always been there for me and I want you to know I do not take you for granted. 
Depression, you have taught me so many life skills. Where would I be now without you? Until we were first introduced I thought I was supposed to acknowledge my feelings. I thought I was supposed express my emotions to my family and other loved ones. Depression, you showed me how to bottle my feelings. You taught me how to hide them so I wasn’t such a bothersome 10 year old.
Before you, I thought my friends and family loved me and enjoyed spending time with me. Looking back, it is embarrassing to think how oblivious I was. Depression, you showed me how to isolate and cease being a bother to my loved ones. Without you I may have made honest connections with people. Thankfully you were there to show me how portray myself as the person I thought they wanted me to be.
Remember when we decided to go back to school? Oh man, without you I may have never signed up for my entrance exam, completed my applications, and enrolled in graduate school. You were there to let me know I hadn’t yet accomplished anything in life. Depression, you have never been one to let me feel that false sense of contentment. Without you I may have turned into one of those people we laugh at. You know the ones that pretend to be happy and content with where they are in life, the ones who never pushed themselves to their bottom.
Going back to school was difficult. There were times during my first semester I thought about dropping out. Thank you for showing me how to stick with it. When our usual drugs stopped doing their job, you were there with recommendations. The alcohol helped me socialize and maintain my ideal persona around my friends. The opiates and benzos helped me stay isolated and quiet when I thought I wanted to start opening up. Man, that vulnerability could have given away my true self. People might have seen how pathetic I really was. 
The plan you wrote and pushed me to follow sufficed for years. I was able to get through school without honesty, vulnerability, and other things people thing are necessary to create meaningful relationships. I followed your advice and convinced people I was one of them; one of the happy and content people we knew were miserable. Graduation came and went. I watched my friends celebrate while I questioned why they insisted on pretending they didn’t hate their lives.
You and I moved my mom into a nursing home just a short time later. Once again, I do not know how I would have made it through without you. I wanted to ask for help, but you showed me how to do it all on my own. The drugs helped. The isolation helped me keep people away. 
Then you let me down for the first time. You told me I could wipe my slate clean that night if I tried to use the rest of my supply. I did what you told me, but I still woke up the next day. I woke up to the emotions you had taught me to hide and ignore. You were gone and I was left to deal. We left me when I needed you the most. I let a friend talk me into asking for help, something you never would have let me do. I missed you so much. I cried for three months straight, begging you to come back. Depression you never came back and I had to give into what people were telling me to do. I had to start being honest. I had to start being vulnerable. I had to start loving and caring for my friends without asking for things in return. I started to laugh. I cried less and less. I learned about gratitude and contentment. I let people convince me they loved and cared for me. They told me I deserved to be loved. 
That was three years ago. I still see you now and then. Please do not take offense that I rarely stop to catch up. Life has gotten busier. I fell in love with a beautiful woman. She has shown me happiness and contentment that I never knew existed. Depression, I learned that not everyone is faking it. I got married a month ago. We had over one hundred people at our wedding. Each one loves us in a different way. My wife and I love waking up every morning. We wake up with smiles and not tears. We are open books with each other and I love her faults. Depression, she loves mine even more. 
It took me longer than I thought, but I have forgiven you. I’m grateful for what you taught me in life. Without you, the beauty and love I see and feel everyday may have been taken for granted. I love you, Depression. I always will, but I had to learn to live without you. 
Sincerely,
Tom

"Reaffirming my decision to stay sober.
I'm standing in Penn Station waiting for my train home.  On the floor across from me is a young person clearly nodding off from heroin. Seeing her just hit me so hard - *that could be me.*  I think that could be many of us. The fact that it's not is something to be truly grateful for. I don't know why some people get sober and others don't. But I do know that for today, no matter how hard it seems, sobriety is the better choice for me.

Keep doing what you are doing. It's worth it. ",

"Having a rough day in long term sobriety. Collapsed business, scared financially - here's how I am handling it.
I started a new business about 5 years ago. It started out great gangbusters and seemed that it would be a big success.  We expanded and I put all of my savings into it.
Well, the beginning was the best thing about the business. It never could handle the overhead and I made the decision to close it a few months ago.

My dad put in a bunch of money towards the end because he believed in it (and he has TONS of experience in starting businesses, selling them, investing in them).  But it didn't work out.  It was a new niche in the industry and the whole niche has petered out.

So my brother is starting a new business.  He has two similar ones in another town that have been sputtering.  I am currently helping him. My dad has great faith in me and is counting on me to help my brother make a go of it.

Why does this matter in sobriety?

Because I feel less than, I feel like I can't do it, I am wondering if I am going down the wrong path, I worry about what not having savings means for my children.  I wonder if I don't work for my brother if anyone else will hire me. I am scared and feel like a failure and am feeling pitiful.

I also have 28 years sober and have to take care of that.

So what I am doing today?

Well, I got up this morning and read the morning meditation and the Upon Awakening part of the big book. Did a little prayer.  Got on my Facebook gratitude group (private with some AA friends) and did my list of 5 gratitudes.  It's amazing how much relief I got just from doing that 5 list of gratitudes. By the end, I already had a good 20-30% relief from my stress and could have listed 20 more.

Then I came here. I am out of town (at a lakehouse which is LOVELY), so I can't go to a meeting.   But y'all count as a meeting.

I am about to take my coffee down to the dock and get quiet and meditate a bit.

And try to remember that I am not in charge. That I just need to do the next right thing. Pray for direction and strength to carry out God's will. Stay in the moment.  

Which my moment, good coffee-on a peaceful lake dock-is pretty great.

I know from experience that my feelings, which may or may not be rooted in fact, are fleeting.  And that I don't know how things may turn out and that I have to accept that.

A harder thing for me to accept, but that I believe, is that I am worthy of love.  Because I believe everyone is worthy of love. And that I am lovable even if I fail big time.

So I need some AA internet hugs from you guysl.  

I am off to the dock to see if I can get this monkey brain to get still a bit.

Update:  Spent the rest of the day lolling about with my honey in bed.  Eating good snacks and fooling around.  Going to bed early. All in all, pretty great day.  I just try to relax.",
"Party drugs at uni ruined my life
I haven't really told this story to many people because it's still very emotional, and to most of my friends from the past couple of years, I just disappeared one day and that was that. I'm not sure why I feel the need to share this, but I'm tired of pretending everything's alright when it isn't. I'll use this forum to try and get it off my chest, if that's ok.

Less than a year ago, I dabbled with drugs at university for the first time. Before this, I smoked weed occasionally, but at my first rave I got quite drunk and caved to the offer of a few lines of MDMA. I remember thinking at the time how the sober me of tomorrow would be angry, but 'uninhibited me' won. I thought I could just try it and move on, because MDMA isn't addictive by nature.

Unfortunately, for me that was not the case at all. The experience was outrageous, forcing my mind outside the boundaries of what I previously considered possible, a very hard experience to refuse. I knew instantly that this was for me, and began using MDMA about once a month in a party context. I find it interesting now that at the time I looked upon friends who used other drugs or didn't control their use with distaste. I thought I could control myself, because for the whole of my life I have been a very logical and self aware person. The risk seemed slight.

However, as months passed my perspectives on drugs changed, and my use became weekly, then several times a week. I attribute this to the normalisation of what I was doing, meaning what once seemed unacceptable was now my norm. My tolerance built massively, and I began to explore other drugs to try and get the feeling back that I cherished so much. I considered my use to be purely recreational, only when partying with friends, but subconsciously I was changing my friendship groups and how much I went out to facilitate more regular use, hence the increase in frequency.

I soon quit my respectable and well paid part time job so I could begin organising raves, because It was the only environment that excited me. I stopped attending lectures, and my mind began to fill constantly with everything I associated with drugs. Bored in the car? I'd think about what combinations of chemicals would be best and how much I would buy for this weekend.

A few months after my first time, I wouldn't be satisfied with MDMA, because it just wouldn't work properly. Substances such as acid, 2CB, ketamine, speed, cocaine, nitrous, marijuana and mephedrone would be used multiple times per week, in varying combinations so I could have a good time. At this point I had no concept of how much I'd changed, thinking I was just a recreational party user, but I had isolated most of my friends who didn't use drugs.

A whole range of awful side effects started occurring, but the urge to use completely overshadowed them. Night terrors, sleep paralysis, minor seizures, depression, panic attacks, sober hallucinations, depersonalisation, extreme paranoia and much more. Despite all of this, I still thought I didn't have a problem, and did not seek help. To my family and outsiders, I was just a uni student from a normal background, so nobody suspected what I was doing, meaning I could easily continue my use without risk of being caught.

As summer approached and friends began moving back home, I looked for new ways to self medicate when I was alone. My alcohol consumption increased ten fold within weeks, along with taking some prescription medication including benzodiazepines to 'help me sleep.' I began to take some recreational drugs alone, resulting in some extremely dangerous situations including letting strangers into my flat and using drugs with them.

Comedowns were getting extreme by this point, so after long weekends I would spend up to a week contemplating suicide, including planning how I would do it. Each time I would vow never to do drugs again because of these feelings, but as soon as I felt normal again, the draw of the parties would be too great.

To cut an already long story short, at the start of September I went clubbing with a few friends and took some cocaine, nitrous and drank a lot. I woke up days later on life support in intensive care. I had suffered a grand mal seizure, which resulted in a respiratory arrest and the dislocation and fracture of both of my shoulders. My brain was starved of oxygen because of this, damaging my cognitive function significantly. The damage to my shoulder joints is so severe that I will never be able to use them properly again, as they will not heal (crater fractures make my joints unstable). I spent 2 months after the event not being able to wipe my own ass, dress myself or bathe. My mother has had to care for me as if I am a toddler again, which has basically ruined her life.

It is now 3.5 months since the event, and I have stayed completely clean from drugs and alcohol since then. However, the impact that my past is having on my present cannot be expressed very easily. I am 20 but cannot be independent anymore. I can't go to a bar because of my addiction issues that have emerged, and I have had to cut most friends out of my life to remove risk of use. My driving license was revoked due to the seizures, and I cannot live at university because of my physical and mental instability.

I don't want people's sympathy, and I am very lucky to be alive and clean, but I hope nobody begrudges me the anger and regret I feel on a daily basis. I was a successful, healthy, happy, well liked person. As a result of some stupid decisions, my whole life has fallen apart.

I understand that many have it a lot worse than me, but I did not know where to post.

Please leave a comment if you'd like to know more, I understand this may raise questions.

I wish everyone my best wishes with their recoveries. We can beat this.

Thanks for your time.

EDIT: I think it is worthy to note that the doctors have told me that due to my low seizure threshold and the high chance of a reoccurrence, if I do any drugs again there is a fairly high risk of death, so I have had to go cold turkey. These few months have been hell on earth, but it is getting easier each day.",

I lost one.

I’ll be at a funeral Wednesday morning.

I spoke at a rehab today about the joy I find in my life in recovery. It’s my favorite thing. I get to talk about my self and talk about recovery. I can do both of these forever.
  

The weather was in unusually fine form today. No fierce wind. Blue sky and sun after a shitty winter (think southern hemisphere). 
I walked out of rehab feeling humbled and full of gratitude and called my sponsor. 

Than I felt numb, no one likes to get that phone call. No one likes to make it either. My sponsor has a depth of compassion that staggers me. 


 Fraser had five years clean and sober before he busted. He’d put all his hopes on getting into rehab but it didn’t stick this time. He called me and we went to meetings and he struggled because he wasn’t getting it back. 

I’m not sure what happened last Thursday but the outcome was permanent.

I feel very strong feelings tonight. I guess I’ll be sitting with them until they pass and pass they will. Wednesday standsure has some tough work ahead. My work is getting through Saturday night.

"Hey guys. I'm kind of in a situation and nobody is picking up their phone. Sorry about its length. I was word vomiting for a while and got feely. I figure this is as safe a place as any to say.
So I have 14 months clean off opiates. And since moving back home in April, my brother, younger by 4 years, has driven home twice drunk. The first I screamed and yelled, the second time, after a calmed down a bit, I told him to call if he can't drive, or call AAA, and above all else to come to me if he needs anything to talk about. I'm his brother, I love him, and now my greatest fear is coming true. 


Tonight I was watching television in the living room. At around 1:30am I heard a loud bang that came from the garage. About 10 minutes later I went outside, the car was head first against the garage (barely made a dent if at all) and he was laid back in the drivers seat, asleep, with the keys still in the ignition. 


We woke him up and I didn't say anything, the worst thing to have happen at that moment was for me to blow up. Wouldn't that be calling the kettle black. 


He claims a friend drove him home, hit the garage door, and he didn't want to walk inside drunk again.  


So he climbed into the drivers seat and fell asleep. 


I'm an addict through and through. This is my line of expertise. The is where I thrived for years, building lie upon lie until it all came crashing down. Time and time again. 


You don't do this shit. That's my job. 


I'm the one that fucks up! I'm the one that lies! I'm the one that manipulates my way out of driving home high! 


...


You're the one that goes to law school. You're the one that gets married to a gay rich man who's 10 years older and took up swimming as a hobby (I don't know why, but that's who I've always pictured my brother ending up with). You're the one that adopts an Asian baby. 



You're the one that grows old. You're the one with a family. 


You're the one who dies happy...


Anyway. I'm kind of at a loss for words right now. It happens once, that's a mistake. It happens twice, that was dumb. But 3 times driving home drunk in a 3 month span is a pattern. 


I just don't want my parents to have to go through this again.

"One Day means a lot
I was just reading a post from someone just starting out. They were updating a thread with their progress in recovery and said ""I know it's not much but I have 3 days"". On the contrary, 3 days sounds like a lot. One day alone is monumental. Beginners hear that a lot from their sober support network and in my experience it's not a throwaway comment. One day is a big deal. 

When I was still trying to figure out if this was actually a problem I told myself not to drink for one day. If I could manage that then everything would be ok and I could put the matter to rest. After a day at work white-knuckling it, I walked by my daily beer spot and went home. I lasted about an hour. I went right back out, bought as much as I could afford and brought it back and didn't even remember doing it. 

One day is a big deal to anyone who has this thing. When we count days it isn't to put people down or rank them-- at least it shouldn't be. I have been to weird ass meetings while traveling where that seemed to be the case. If that's an issue it doesn't have to be part of your program. ""Take what you need and leave the rest behind"" was a saying I heard a lot when i was trying to make sense of all of AA's moving parts. 

For me, eleven years later, ""one day at a time"" doesn't take the effort that it did back when I first came in. It does get easier but the days themselves mean a lot more than they ever did before I stopped drinking. Days used to be something I had to endure, instead of something to make a life out of. ",
"You never know when a tragedy is going to be a gift...
One of the gifts of being sober is being present in my life enough to see what happens next.

When I had around 3-4 years sober, my house burned down. I lost everything but my cat (thank god).  Even the clothes I had on were ruined from the smoke and debris.  Luckily no one human was hurt (except my neighbor's cat - sob).

I was pretty young, but I still lost my pictures, journals, all of my school books/notes for college, clothes, memorabilia - everything.  I particularly missed my sweater collection.  At the time it was totally devastating.

For a few months I lived out of a duffle bag. I luckily had some insurance money because I was still covered under my parent's insurance. Lesson here - always have renter's insurance.  But it took a bit for it to come in. Plus I had to replace everything - every toothbrush, pair of underwear, piece of furniture, etc within a certain time frame and had to provide the insurance company with receipts.

So I had to shop a lot for a few months.  You don't realize how much crap we have until you have to replace every single piece of it.

I have never really liked shopping again.  I go out of necessity. I might shop for pleasure once every few years.

As a result, I have learned that while I like nice stuff, it's just stuff. It comes. It goes. 

This has turned out to be of the most freeing aspects of my life.  I have listened to friends over the years get obsessed with stuff. I understand that desire, but after losing everything, it's just not as big a deal as it might have been to me.

I can't overstate the positive impact this has had on my life. It has allowed me to make radical decisions with less fear. It has allowed me to risk. It has allowed me to focus on things that really bring me joy.

It's been over 20 years.  While it was totally painful at the time, there have been many gifts from it.  Life is weird.

"Lost another soul to the disease.
I've been around the rooms for 5 years and this isn't the first person I have known to die from this insidious disease but it doesn't get any easier. This person saved many addicts lives over the last two decades and was such a positive person and ALWAYS carried a smile on his face.  One thing that sticks out to me is whenever he would share in meetings he would share about if he ever went back out he wouldn't make it back alive and his death is a sobering reminder that I need to stay vigilant in my recovery on a daily basis. It's really sad that another addict had to make the ultimate 12th step but just for today I am clean and I will stay vigilant on my recovery. i can only pray that this doesn't have to happen to anyone else who finds a new way to live.",
"two months fully sober
hello friends! i am two months totally sober. i quit mdma & alcohol on february 3, 2013 and i quit smoking weed on june 14. it has been hard withdrawing off of mdma & alcohol. i really never thought i would be able to live without those escapes and extreme binges i indulged in. i also never thought i would be able to quit smoking weed. quitting weed is proving to be one of the hardest things so far. i can feel a withdrawl like my security blanket has been taken away and i really have no choice but to deal with my emotions and life on a daily basis. im grateful i learned some coping strategies while i was in a harm reduction phase (while i was off mdma & alcohol i was still smoking weed). now i find that being totally sober is very difficult. weed has always been my go to, it has always been the thing that i can just chill with, my social ice breaker, my means to talk to people, my security after a long binge on alcohol or mdma, basically my thing for so long. i am so happy to let it go now that i dont feel like i need it in that same way because i have been off the hard stuff for so long already. But in all the recovery i have been doing, i have to say i am most grateful that i stopped smoking weed. being sober this long without weed, alcohol and mdma is a blessing. 

i am mostly just sharing that i am very grateful today. it gets better and easier whichever way you go, either totally cold turkey or harm reduction. ",
"Then and Now. A quick story of my recovery so far.

A typical day for me went like this.  I had no sense of time so I would wake up at various times of the day, be it 2pm, 3am, 7 in the morning, 9 at night, whatever.  I would go to the toilet before rolling a joint, smoke it and follow it with a few pills.  I would then sit and waste away the day on youtube or watch something torrented.  I'd continue using, topping up whenever it felt like my stone or gouch was wearing off.  I would be awake for 4-6 hours before falling back asleep for 2-3 hours and repeat.  Towards the end of my using I would eat a microwaved meal once every 2 days while topping up with snacks like biscuits or chocolate and soft drinks.  The only break to this routine was a Thursday when I would get my benefit welfare and go score and buy about £15 of 'food' for the week ahead.  Even the scoring and shopping became a routine in itself.

I was isolated at home with hardly any contact with people or the world. I had no job and no hope nor wish for one.  I had no self respect, no sense of self worth and was suffering from depression and anxiety. Towards the end I ended up paranoid, which probably became psychosis, with an irrational fear that I was being watched, followed, listened to and conspired against. I feared that I was going to be killed by some stranger.  I had a constant, nagging sense of impending doom.

I stopped caring for myself. I didn't wash or shave or cut my hair or change my clothes. My flat was a total mess with rubbish and fruit flies everywhere. I didn't take my dog out and allowed her to piss and shit all round the house. I didn't care.

Fast forward.

I got into recovery last november and today I have managed 4 months clean and sober. 

I don't have a typical day anymore.  Every day is unique and rewarding.

I'm attending a community rehab program (which I complete in 2 months). I'm there 5 days a week. I do fellowship meetings at night.  In between I go do stuff with the new friends I have made in recovery.  I play golf every Tuesday and badminton every Saturday, 2 sports I only took up in recovery. I took up running a few months ago and recently ran my first 10km race (53 mins). I also got into cycling and right now I'm working with the guys at the rehab to get funding to start a cycling club for folks in recovery.  

Fellowship wise, I do 4-5 meetings per week, I have a home group and I'm a member at another 2. I've shared four times at the top table, twice at meetings that I rarely attend and once at a step meeting on step 1. I'm going to be chairing my home group meeting for 4 weeks in August. I got involved with service and sit on the steering committee for the convention for this area and will also be on the task force at the convention.

All this is gravy though. Life beyond my wildest dreams? Dam right. I have friends that I look forward to spending time with. I can look them in the eye. I can hold and enjoy conversations. I have good relationships with my family today. I like myself. My confidence is growing and my self esteem getting better. I have hopes, dreams and goals for the future.

and Just for Today I am clean and serene without the desire to use.


If you're reading this and are struggling in recovery then hold on. Life gets better.  You WILL beat your withdrawals. You WILL solve your problems.  You WILL recover. You might not see how it's possible, but, that's okay. Just have faith that the miracle will happen for you and it will.

Love, gratitude and respect to you all.

"Atheist 12 steppers, what's your higher power?
This is the situation i'm in.  My sponsor is god heavy, but I find I can simply replace god with the things I do believe in and still learn lessons from people in the rooms that I trust.  My higher power has slowly molded into the universe, what it has in store for me, and its nature.  I believe its in my best interest, as actions and interactions with the universe, which I for the most part have no power over, not to use or drink anymore.  Only time and progress will tell, but I believe whatever i'm powerless over doesn't want me to drink.  I say the serenity prayer and the third step prayer often, but I don't know what i'm praying too-they just serve as a good reminder that i'm not in control-and give me some peace of mind.",

Feeling ashamed when people use me as a punchline for drinking jokes or jabs. Forgoing all other activities to drink. I've simply had enough.

Cold turkey, with the help of my S.O. and brother.

"Done experimenting
After 14 months 100% clean I went back on the meds that sent me to rehab in the first place. It took two years to admit, but this does not and will never work for me. I will always abuse them. I do not need them. 

Today I sobbed to my mom the truth. Only my family didn’t know I was back on them. Mom is 1 year clean after 10 years off the wagon, and she was so wonderfully supportive. It really lessened my anxiety about picking up a white chip next week.

"Well here I am. I fucked up again. On a train headed to a 6 month program.
Hi all. Just wanted to share. I’ve been chasing my tail in addiction for 10 years. Was clean for almost two years. Working at a residential treatment program. Almost completed an internship. Started abusing Gabapentin and Kratom. Got kicked out. Headed to a sister program to start all over. Had 20 minutes to pack. Currently on the train headed there. Drinking jack and diet. I hate myself. It’s a six month program. 

I just needed to share that. I feel humiliated but I’m trying to take it in humility. Don’t know if this is the right place to post this but there it is. Any supportive words are appreciated.

"Early Stages of Detox
Every day. Every single day, every passing moment, was a struggle. I always seemed to be clammy and sweaty, 24/7. As if my skin had a microscopic spongey top layer that felt slightly wet wherever I touched it. I always had to wear hats for this reason. I could never shower before going to the clinic in the morning. My hair would stick to the sides of my face and neck where it wasn’t pulled up into a ponytail. I already drank 2-3 bottles of water from the time I woke up around 3-4am. Sitting up furiously, esophagus burning, like I had to burp but nothing would come up except for throw-up feelings shooting up from my stomach to my neck and jaw muscles, until I got that water bottle. If I didn’t sit up and drink a ton of water like that every half hour or so my body wouldn’t let me rest; withdrawal would start to come on. I was cold all the time, always cold. The winters on methadone were the absolute worst as it was, but detoxing brutalized it. I put on a minimum of 3 layers of leggings before a heavy pair of baggy pajama pants before going out in the early morning. A gigantic coat over two hoodies over a sweater. And one of my bedazzled hats to hide my hair and face. I had to start the truck early and let it really warm up, so I’d get out there by 5:20 to do so. Then I’d have to peel everything off and wait 20 minutes or else I’d be a ball of sweat. Put everything back on. The more I exert myself doing all this, the quicker withdrawal comes on. Drinking more water.

The clinic opened at 6am. I would shoot to get there at least 15-20 minutes early, maybe I’d be 4th or 5th place in line. By 6:20-6:35 I’d finally get my dose. Then the ride home. I’d follow my dose with even more water, so it’d be absorbed quicker. When I’d leave the clinic, I’d still be in withdrawal, but by the time I got ¾ the way home, I’d just start to begin feeling it ease. Over the next hour I’d lay down and try to start to relax, and I’d feel as close to normal for the day as I’d get by 7:30am. Where I didn’t feel quite sick but not quite dope-ish yet either. Then, slowly, I’d start to nod here and there, eyes drooping. The deepest kind of relaxation and relief would wash over me, making me sloshy and sleepy. By 10:30 I’d be out. I’d drift off for a few hours. Wake up around 1-2pm. Roll around trying to wake up for another hour. Finally, ready to shower by 3pm. Whenever I blew dry my hair, or tried putting on make-up, I’d be constantly sweating, no doubt from the methadone and all the damn water I drank in the morning. So, I’d very rarely do either one. The rest of the day was the only time I had to get everything I couldn’t do earlier done. Laundry, taking care of my cats, eating. You know, the most minimal effort needed to survive. It’s not like I would ever have much energy to do anything anyway. If I was too active, the next morning would always be way worse than normal. The more active, the more severe.

Everything I did, I did slowly. Took forever to get places. It was no kind of life to live.

I felt like such a piece of shit.

But now… everything has changed. It feels miles behind me now, however I’ve clearly retained a vivid recollection of my experience on it. In truth, I don’t intend to let myself forget it. That detox is why it’s so easy to love every single passing day now in sobriety. My capacity for joy, depth and peace knows no bounds. I fully embody a true knowing of my own self. From where my very soul outpours. The true space of inspiration. From where I speak to you now. This depth and knowing is what erased my fear of detoxing. I fixed something inside me before the world around me reflected this fix. I became one with my environment. Giving, reflecting, love.",

"8 months Clean!!
So I've posted here before on getting my 60 and 90 days and how I was excited to reach those times frames. After the 3rd month I felt into some of the worst depression outside of my active addiction. It was debilitating to say the least. On my days off, I couldn't leave my room. Just watched tv from the minute I woke up till I slept. I hated waking up with a passion. And I loved going to sleep. At work I did the bare minimum. I'm my own boss so I got away with a lot but obviously my business suffered.  I also was under the gloom that my professional license was going to be restricted or taking away or I was going to be under some extensive monitoring program. I wasn't working the steps. Didn't believe in any higher power but I was still going to meeting. About 2.5 months ago I sought professional help. At the same time I was told by the licensing regulation authority for my profession that I was cleared of any possible monitoring or restrictions. That news couple with an antidepressant made me feel literally a hundred times better. Maybe coupled with time too. I started working the steps. I started feeling really good. My job performance improved exponentially. Everyone from family, friends and clients started noticing the change and complement almost on a daily basis. I started working out a month ago at 6 30 am on a daily basis. I look and feel much better already. I'm always keeping busy at all times. I can't stand staying in my room anymore or not being productive at work. I love mornings. I really don't want to sleep that many hours cause I want to enjoy every second that I'm awake. But..... I think I'm over exterting myself. I'm running around like a chicken with its head cuff. I cant not not go the gym. It's become an obesion. I've also indulged myself with shopping. I want to look really good on the outside. I guess I want to enjoy the things I missed on for almost 8 years in a few months. Just wanted to share what's going on with me to see if anyone can relate.

"Question for other IV meth addicts.
Okay, I'm a 24 year old male.  I've been sober for almost two years now. I have been struggling with cravings the entire time I've been sober.  When I think about injecting, my stomach tightens up and I get a huge adrenaline rush.  They are almost always intrusive thoughts.  Rarely do I sit and stew upon it.  I also have been having problems with using dreams.  3-4 times a week, I have dreams about getting high. Primarily injecting.  I have absolutely no desire to get high, but for some reason I still have cravings and using dreams.

Just need somewhere to vent I guess.

I've been in relapse mode for a while, not taking care of myself. Now I hear he overdosed and passed away last night. I want him to know how much I care about him but I can't bring myself to attend his memorial service because of all the AA people that are going to be there. It would be totally disrespectful for me to show up. But that doesn't change how I feel. I mourn his loss and it is scaring me to the point of feeling like I'm ready to change again.

But I can't go. We went to the same meetings, knew the same people, did the same activities. I just know it wouldn't be good for me to show up to mourn him while all the pillars of the local AA community are there.

This fucking sucks and I miss my friend and wish I could tell him how much I care. But here I am afraid to even show my face because everyone will know I'm lost on dope again too. This is a really shitty feeling. It hurts. On one hand I feel like it would be selfish to not pay my final respects. On the other hand I think it would be selfish and inappropriate to attend when I know he died by the needle and all of the sober crowd will be there. Can't win some times.",
"13 months sober, filing for divorce and it is ripping my heart out.
I have been married for 6 years. Prior to, and during the marriage I drank... a lot. Two small children later and I found myself unable to stop using... there was no way I could ""will"" my way out of it. I remember walking into the liquor store, saying ""I am not going to drink, I am not going to drink..."" even as I put the bottle to my lips. 
Last November, I realized that I was going to kill myself, it seemed to be the only option. And then some part of me buried deep inside decided to ask for help. I spent 30 days in rehab and have not had a drink since. 
Things at home improved at first. But then they didnt. While I was a much more attentive father, and a much better husband, my wife and I held on to our resentments. As I worked through the 12 steps, I was able to let go... 
But my wife has held on to hers. We have been to two different therapists recently (5 in all of our years). The first was awful, the second, wonderful, and 30 years sober himself. 
After our second was born, my wife took time off from work. 
Before she went back, I told her that we needed to see our therapist. If we did not, I would consider it to be her choosing work over our marriage. So far, she has made 3 out of 10 appointments. 
We tend to fight daily. It sucks. The day after Trump won, I made a post to FB, ""the most important thing we can do in our lives is to love ourselves and one another"". She saw the post and exited the shower to say ""you would know all about loving yourself, wouldnt you, you self centered asshole""... needless to say she was bitter that Hillary won. 
Today, she leaves for work at 7, comes home at 7 as well. That leaves me with all duties for the kids, drop off, pick up, diner, bath and bedtime. 
I also work 60 hrs a week, finishing the days work after the kids go to bed. I find myself growing new resentments. Not only do we continue to argue out of no where, my wife doesnt contribute to bills, to cooking, to housekeeping... and don't get me started on sex.  If I get laid, it is probably time to renew my drivers license. 
The day after I received my 1 year chip I filled out my divorce papers. I have come to realize that the change I have been praying for has not come. The hard realization was that I have been teetering on the edge of sobriety. Despite a fantastic sponsor, great sponsees, and a solid program.... I cannot and likely will not remain sober much longer in this relationship. My brain tells me to leave. While I would have already filed, we have to great young kids. 
Despite everything, she is a fantastic mother. I am so scared to file for divorce. And I am so scared to stay. I have been praying, and praying, but I cannot escape the tension and fear. Equal parts when I consider staying, or when I consider going. This is the only time in my sobriety that I have truly felt shaken. 

Thanks for reading, that was a long one. I think my sponsor is tired of hearing me on this. I am currently in sonoma, ca. My wife and in laws have been wine tasting all day, and I just needed to let this out.",
"Victim mentality is an enemy of sobriety...
A few weeks ago, a speaker who had more than a few decades sober and clean said that victim mentality was the main enemy of sobriety and that is was worse than just simple resentment. His sentiment resonated all too well with me. Victim mentality is being so entrenched in resentment that you feel the world is rigged against you and that you feel that you will never have a chance to live up to any potential. The belief that you are damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

The trouble with modern internet culture, social media and sites like reddit is that self-pity, delusion and victim mentality are rampant. In our culture, it is not considered weird to record yourself for hours and hours complaining about your imperfect life and post these videos on Youtube for anyone to see or write depressing things on Facebook day in day out. For years, I dwelled in victim mentality. I believed my looks, racial background and upbringing were the cause of all of my failures in life. It fueled my drinking and drugging. It doesn't help when there is a toxic echo chamber self-pity forum, sub reddit and message board for any and every different type of person out there. I believe human beings are self-conscious and prone to self-doubt and insecurity by nature. But American society thrives on our insecurity to trick us into buying stuff we don't need to impress people we don't like with money we don't have. Afterall, our economy is based on consumer spending in a society where most people's basic needs are met. It is no secret we live in a spiritually bankrupt society. 

When we feel inadequate because we are made to feel too short, too tall, too white, too black, too fat, too skinny, too pale, too dark etc. and all the overpriced overhyped shiny plastic crap made in China doesn't make us happy, we turn to drinking and drugs. The program is all about becoming comfortable in one's own skin. And that takes time and working the steps everyday. It's slowly happening in my life. But I can still find myself slipping into victim mentality. It's hard to take personal responsibility for being what normal people would call a loser most of your life. ",
"So this is what Addiction is like.
I should have seen this coming. I come from a family of drug addicts. Like many of us, I told myself I could control it. And I did, for a while.. Many years actually.

I started experimenting with drugs when I was 14. And that's where it stayed for years. I even went through a period of about 2 years where I was a happy, healthy person, only using hard drugs on occasion, and generally non-addictive ones like LSD or MDMA. Now I realize that it took me so long to get addicted to drugs because they weren't available to me. 

Recently my drug of choice has become quite available to me. I can't control myself. I do anything that gives me pleasure again and again until it no longer gives me pleasure. Weather it's food, sex, video games, drugs, or whatever. This has never been too much of a problem until now.

I just realized that I haven't been more than a day or 2 without my favorite drug in a month or so. I don't even want to count how much money I've spent on this in the last month. Well over $1000 if I had to guess. 

It all happened so fast. 4 months ago I was sober, happy, just got a great promotion at work... But just like that, everything is crumbling. I'm starting to drop the ball at work more and more. I'm starting to loose the reputation I worked so hard for. I used to be so invested in work. I used to love it, now my love has shifted to something much darker.

 I don't know what I'm going to do once my stash inevitably runs out. It should just be a day or two. I can't afford to buy more drugs. And I'm not just talking about the money. We all know they cost much more than that. 

I know that when my stash runs out I'm going to crash, and crash hard. I haven't had a full nights sleep in a month. I don't know how I'm going to keep going to work when I'm withdrawling. I already know some of the lengths I'm willing to go to get a fix. And not even to get high either. It doesn't even make me feel good. I just need it to not feel exhausted. I just need it to feel normal.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I've had a taste of what addiction feels like but I know I have so much further before I truly hit rock bottom. I'm at a tipping point, I have just now realized in the last week that I have a serious problem, but if I'm strong enough I might just be able to get out of this, but I have never been all that strong. 

I can't tell my family or friends, it would be too humiliating. It would break my mothers heart. I'm the good kid. I was supposed to go far. She's so incredibly proud of what I've achieved. So so proud. She already went through this once with my brother, all it brought was pain.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I'm just incredibly high and incredibly sad, and I had this need to finally tell someone about my problem, even if no one ever reads this, it's still making me feel better.

Thank you",

"A Former Addict is About to Die (Not Me)
Edit: Last night, they gave her the morphine. Like a true former-addict, she amazingly made it through the night. She woke up this morning and is able to get up to go to the bathroom. She's bought a little more time with the family. The doctors are going to giver her whatever it takes to manage the intense pain she is in, and I don't think she's long for this world. Thanks for all your thoughts and prayers and well-wishes. Maybe the universe decided that she's got a little more time, and maybe your energy helped that. :D 

My step-brother's wife was a crystal meth addict. She struggled for many years trying to get clean, and put herself and family through a lot of pain. 

She was diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer a few months ago, and now it has overtaken her body to the point that it is a giant mass that covers her entire chest cavity. 

They are going to give her morphine to ease the pain, and the doctors have said that she is likely to fall asleep, not wake up and then her heart will stop. I'm glad to know that it will be a rather peaceful death. She died sober. I do not consider this a relapse of any sort. She is in an immense amount of pain and is ready to be removed from her body. 

Just you know, keep her in your thoughts if you could. She won the fight as far as I am concerned, just like we all can. As an addict myself, I hope that I can meet death with the same bravery and sobriety. 

I think I am going to go and lose my shit for a little bit.

"3 Years today. Thank you all
3 years ago today I woke up in the same bed I did today. I didn't have the certainty that I'd stay sober this long, but I was getting help instead of waking up in the cold sweats from not smoking weed and saying I'd never go back only to do it again within a week. I had been treating a living sober problem with many different drugs and alcohol, and bullshitted myself that one drug or another was OK for years. I was almost out of high school, had no real life plan, was driven by material desires, and felt miserable and hopeless. The drugs hardly put a dent in my depression. In retrospect, I'm glad they stopped working because it forced me into that place of desperation where I was willing to commit to real change.

By the grace of God I was given an outpatient counselor who recovered, people around the tables talking about the *steps* of Alcoholics Anonymous, a sponsor who I could talk to about the steps and be reminded that I could stay sober regardless of external circumstances the same way I got drunk or high regardless of external circumstances, and later the opportunities to carry the message (after having my own spiritual experience *as a result of these steps*). If it weren't for all these people and the program of action I've taken, I don't know if I'd even be alive, let alone sober and free. I know I'm not cured, but the obsession has been removed and I want to keep it that way. 

While the above are more tangible forces in my new life, through this subreddit I've been given more opportunities to help those who still suffer, and I've also had my ego checked when it was needed. Whether you've had 1 day or a half century sober, I'd like to thank all of you for your contributions to this sub. This goes especially to newcomers whether we've talked or not: You help me stay sober more than I can help you. If you ever want to talk, feel free to PM me. It's truly a pleasure to carry the message. 

TL;DR Picking up the spiritual toolkit will remove the obsession to get loaded. No human power can relieve our alcoholism/addiction but I couldn't learn how to use these spiritual tools without the help of others who did it before me and I won't stay sober without passing it on to people still suffering. Thank God and all the people he put in my life for helping me stay sober 3 years.

"Just pulled my passed out, bloody drunk French neighbor out of a Bush.
I just got back from a meeting/fellowship, picking up my 9 months chip. Pull in the gate of my complex and almost run over a pair of legs. My 60yo French neighbor is passed out drunk in a bush with his legs hanging in the street, his face covered in blood. So I was able to wake him and pull him out of the bush, and 15 minutes later, finally get him back into his loft. He was cussing me out the whole time in French, saying I'm what's wrong with America (wtf?). Finally get him home, try and help him wipe the blood off, try and look in his eyes to see if he is concussed, and he slaps me upside the head. He demanded that I pour him a glass of wine and light him a cigarette, which I did.  Once he was in his chair, I dipped the fuck out. 

Its like I feel good and bad about helping him. Some other people just walked by him laughing as he was laying there. But now I feel like I should have maybe called an ambulance considering his age and potential for a head injury. I mean it wasn't much blood, but he definitely took a gnarly fall so who knows if he maybe hurt his head. I feel guilty about pouring him the wine, but he demanded and I kind of figured he'd pass out before drinking it.  I am going to check on him in the morning. 

What a sobering experience. Feel very grateful I am no longer that angry drunk fool passed out in a bush covered in blood, cause lord knows it happened a few times to me. I got my ass literally almost beat to death once, left in a pile of blood in a parking lot for 4 hours before someone found me. I still have slight permanent double vision/brain damage from it. If I even would have lived to 60 years old as an active alcoholic (which I doubt, I was ready to check out), that's who I would have become. Feeling very VERY fucking grateful to be sober at 26!

--This isn't meant as a humble brag, to make me feel better about my position, or to solicit praise helping a stranger, but merely a sharing of a mind blowing experience.  I hope I am not coming off as conceited or preachy.  I'm honestly just baffled by what just happened.  ",
"Humbled by Gratitude- 20 Years and Counting
I got sober on December 8th, 1993, one week after my 22nd birthday and five months before graduating from college.  It's now 3 weeks after my 20th anniversary and I recently turned 42.

I want to tell everyone that 1) it works, 2) I  still regard myself as a newcomer, and 3) I cannot get over how amazing my life has become, and I know that this is just the beginning!

Over the last week I have been in tears of gratitude pretty much every day.  

When I first came in, and was hanging on by a tooth, struggling each day not to drink or use, I asked my sponsor if sobriety ever got easier.  She replied, ""It doesn't get easier, but it gets different.""

Now I know what she meant- only took 20 years to understand- I'm on the ""sometimes slowly"" track.  :o)  At any rate the bad news is that I have to keep digging deeper into surrender and service and steps to maintain my spiritual condition.  What was good enough at 5 years or 10 years isn't good enough now.

The good news is that I *get* to keep digging deeper, continue to change and grow and have the opportunity to do this as a lifetime project in community with others.  

I'm on my way to a meeting this evening but wanted also to share here as today my cup is overflowing with gratitude.

I posted on here a month ago some of my concerns about the process of finding a sponsee and you guys were very helpful. Well at my regular young people's meeting I mentioned some of the same concerns to a friend there and one of the more extremely active dudes in the room said ""You want a sponsee? No problem"" and the next week he pointed someone in my direction.

"This is life or death.
I'll be burying yet another friend from this disease this week. He thought he could just drink, but it led him back to his DOC and now he's gone. 

Don't be confused, this disease will kill you. If you think you can manage your use, then try. But if you can't, then don't think that a few months of sobriety will change that. I tried many different ways to manage my using and drinking, but TODAY I'm not confused about the progression that my disease has, even when I'm sober and working a program. The next time I use, I will be back where I left off. It will be about a 1 week time period before I'm back to using 2 eightballs a night and chasing it with a bottle of liquor and whatever pills I can get my hands on. It's about 2 weeks before I've cleared my bank accounts and been disowned. 

This is life or death, and if you don't believe that then give up your chair at the meeting for someone who does, because you're just not ready. ",
"4 years, grateful, complacent, hopeful
I celebrated four years without a drink or a drug a week ago. The first two years of my recovery I worked through the fourth step, took suggestions, had a sponsor and a home group. Loved it.

These last two years I've moved three times and just last week I worked up the courage to try and reconnect. Got myself a home group and a sponsor. I'm happy to get back in with two feet, and I'm happy that NA still works if I take action.

In the last year I got laid off and have had moved back in with the folks at 26. I told my girlfriend of five months that I loved her tonight and I meant it, I never ever could have spoken those words without the steps. Today I'm grateful for you fine folks and the life that I've achieved with your help.

"I'm on the verge of full blown addiction but feel like its not too late to stop with minimal damage done. This is my first cry for help.
I'm a 24 years old male living in the greater Boston area. My girlfriend and I were in a motorcycle accident last September and were prescribed pain killers. Long story short, I'm still doing them. My usage is minimal. I may go through one or two percocet 30's a month but that's it. I'm a weekend warrior. I can go a week at a time without using and I have no real physical withdrawal but mentally I'm hooked. I feel like I'm walking on a razor thin line and one misstep and I'm a goner.  How can I curve my mental cravings? I need some techniques to beat this before it beats me. This is my first time reaching out for some advice. Please, help.

Edit: I can't say thank you enough. Your stories and words have made me realize this needs to end before it ruins my life. It's been amazing to sort of absorb this out pouring of support. Up until this point, my battle has been internal, against myself. I've adopted a new outlook. My battle is now again this drug. I'm angry at it for degrading my sense of self. You are all angels in your own way and I hope someday I will be able to give someone else what you've given me, perspective. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.",
"9 months today
Nine months ago today I embarked on the road to recovery, I didn't know if it would work and I didn't have the ability to handle my life or my alcoholism but in minute to minute increments. 

Today, my life has transformed. I can go about my life, good and bad, one day at a time, and not need to drink over it. I am excited today because even though 9 months is not a very long amount of time, I know that I have grown. 

Before I got sober, I remember realizing that even though I had wanted to have kids since before I could remember I could never imagine not drinking long enough to do so and although I am not at a place in my life right now where I am having children, it feels really amazing to know that I have the option now.

Just something I thought I would share, Have a great day everyone :)",

"Why did I drink?
Why did I drink?

I often ask myself that, why did I drink when I don’t need to now?

I drank first to overcome shyness and worry and fear - I was a teenager and who isn't shy worried and fearful when they are a teenager? Drink took all that away in an instant. Before I was even half way down the second glass all shyness, worry and fear had evaporated and I was able to come out of my sulkyness and become a part of society. Gone was the self-centred, moody teenager. I had grown up in an instant.

For the next ten or so years, drinking helped me enormously. When I was feeling lonely I'd have a drink and be able to socialise with people. I got married drunk, had two kids drunk. We bought a big house drunk, I got promoted drunk, but the amount I was drinking was steadily rising. It took more and more and more to get the shyness, worry and fear to go away and it wasn't long before whenever I took just one drink I wouldn’t stop until I either passed out or was locked up. Every time I drank I just become more and more disgustingly and dangerously anti-social. Drugs helped for a while - they sobered me up so I could drink more but that was just a stop gap, eventually I couldn't get enough of them either.

To cut a long story short I lost everything - marriage, kids, job, house, teeth, and finally I lost my mind. Drinking had stopped working for me. It seem that no matter how much I drank I was getting more isolated, worried and fearful. Eventually something just snapped in my head. It was like some kind of Faustian nightmare, gone were the good times and all I could see that was ahead of me was hell.

After about 8 years in and out of AA meetings (mainly out) I finally resigned myself to the fact that alcohol had stopped working and for me never would again. Abstinence was the only solution but I had become so addicted to the stuff, staying stopped seemed like an impossibility. 

Eventually after one last debacle I fell back into going to regular AA meetings once again. But this time it seemed like a new willingness to go to any length to stay stopped – I think probably because I had finally seen the hopelessness of my situation. After a few months not drinking my head cleared sufficiently enough for me to see what my problem was. 

Alcohol wasn't my problem. For a long time alcohol had been my solution but it had stopped working. My problem was my shyness, my anxiety, my fear of life itself. Nothing had changed. I was still that shy self-centred ego-centric teenager and that was the problem. Through all my drinking I had simply never grown up. That was the root of all my troubles. I was a child trying to make his way in a grown up world.

Through Alcoholics Anonymous I have learned a new way of living, a way to deal with my neuroses - a ""legitmate way to wholeness"" to paraphrase Dr Carl Jung. I have made a start on growing up – something I should have done all those years ago instead of drinking I suppose.

I think most people drink because it takes them away from themselves albeit briefly. It wasn’t brief for me, I made a career out of it. But eventually for me, like all alcoholics sooner or later that all stops working. It's a just chemical serenity we get and we quickly build up a tolerance to that chemical and so need more and more and more until we simply cannot get enough of the stuff in us. For me I now know there is no going back. I can never go back to being a social drinker. Something has broken inside me - alcohol doesn't work anymore and never will. Just one drink for me will lead to a million more.

But it's been three years now since I had an obsessive thought about alcohol. ""life is hard"" to quote Scott M Peck - but the last thing I think about now is having a drink. I have finally found a real way to shrug off shyness, worry and fear but this time it doesn't involve any chemicals (well at least none that are not naturally manufactured by my own body). 

Three years ago I was hugging a pillow on the locked ward of a psychiatric hospital. Today I am 1,111 days sober. I have a job, a career in fact, I am no longer homeless, my kids are talking to me, I have hundreds of friends and colleagues and I can look every one of them in the eye and we can laugh and cry and I can do all of that clean and sober. 

AA is an oral tradition; it works simply through one alcoholic talking to another. I now know that my shyness - my lack of confidence - was just a manifestation of self-centredness. The way I increase my confidence today is by confiding in others, the way I reduce my self-centredness is through constant thought of others. Through AA and the principles in the 12 steps I have found a legitimate way of living - a real way to be happily and usefully whole without out any thought of alcohol or the hell it’ll take me back to.

I have 60 days today. 
1,440 hours of sobriety. Its crazy! 

I feel exponentially happier at this moment than I ever did when I was getting high. Feels good, man

I'm still working on my fourth step currently and I go to at least one meeting a day. I actually just got back from an AA dance. Dancing sober is fun. And dancing sober with other sober people is so fun, so liberating. I'm not stressing on trying to rely on something to make me feel good or confident!

I made my first post about starting this journey, I've made posts about the pink cloud and I've made posts about mental illness. 

I'm still struggling (who isn't?) but I don't plan on picking up. I have worked hard to find another job (which I did, recently, woot woot!), work on my relationship with my family, and nurturing friendships that I neglected, and slowly but surely things are getting better.

"Celebrated my first sober holiday today.
Was definitely interesting since Halloween is purely for partying once you're of age. Decided to go to an NA function instead. I was very anxious before going and thought about maybe bringing a little bit of my drug of choice or drinking before I went. I recently relapsed and was falling victim of the ""better now than later"" mentality. Scumbag brain: You're just losing a little bit of clean time. 
Anyways, so glad I went and that I stayed sober. Until tonight, I haven't appreciated sobriety. I realized tonight how beautiful sobriety and recovery truly is. You're experiencing real life, people, and emotions. Yeah, the band they hired was terrible, and I didn't really know very many people. BUT, I'm going to actually sleep tonight, not feel like shit tomorrow, have my family not be disappointed in me. I'm just so thankful. ",

"A few years into recovery, I found that I am recovering from more things than I'd imagined...
Some of these things include racism, homophobia and misogyny. It seems I 'inherited' some core beliefs about the world, myself and others that are pretty dysfunctional and unhelpful with regard to living a contented and loving life. Low self-esteem, not-enough-ness, self-loathing, oh sweet wine gargling Jesus the list seems endless. Anyone else feel the work required in undoing the stories we tell about ourselves a bit overwhelming at times? I know that just about every time I get to a stage in my life where it feels too much and everything is going wrong, that is actually the time when I am ready to let go and accept some wisdom, wherever that may come from. It never feels good and I am right at that place right now.",
"My clean time has become my enemy.
So I've come to find out that in spite of my best efforts that my ego has found something new to connect to and feed off of -- my clean time, and it is trying to kill me.  I'm not really sure why or how this has happened but I'd like to share about it.

I recently had my 4 year anniversary in NA.  A week before this I almost got high.  I almost got high because I had some diluted perceptions about clean time.  I did not actively come to these conclusions but with the help of my sponsor and some other loving friends in NA I was able to understand some new things about myself through my actions and in-actions.  The first is that at meetings I regular or frequent, I am scared to share my true struggles.  I guess the underlying factor is that I'm overly concerned with what people will think about my recovery program.  As a result of doing this I continued to get sicker and sicker and more detached from the program and people who are in that room time save my life.  I felt as though if I shared some real shit that I was going through that people would judge me, they would say like I have said so about so many others, ""If that's what 4 years clean looks like I don't want it.""  What a slap in the face about my own personal judgements of others.

I guess the next real issue that came up for me that I was able to identify was that I could not share with or trust anybody who has had less clean time than me.  People I've sponsored who have moved on to new sponsors or newcomers who are vigilant about working a recovery program or basically anybody with less time than me.  I got into a place where I was severely neglecting understanding of the 12th tradition, and everyone I came across was either above or below me, but nobody was on equal footing.  There have been plenty of people in my life with less time but more recovery than me, that the god of my understanding was sending into my life to provide me with wisdom and help, that I completely neglected because my mind was closed to learning from these people.  This again was a contributing factor to something that almost killed me, or if not my physical body my spirit.

I found myself miserable, destitute,  and more alone than I have ever felt in recovery.  I could not understand why.  I will say I am thankful for my near-relapse experience, it has brought a level of humility into my life that was necessary for my survival and continued work in this program.  I am learning from new comers, I am sharing openly without(maybe a little bit) fear of judgement, and have become open-minded enough to a learn a little bit from everyone.  I have been reminded that I am just a garden variety addict, and that my clean time does not mean I am practicing a recovery program.",
"One year ago today I made a decision that has changed my life.
I remember it all too well, the massive headaches, the shaking, the puking, the hot & cold flashes, the insomnia. It was the end of another multi-month binge. I was 35 years old, too old to be acting like this and too young to be feeling like this.

I had no job, no friends, my family wasn't speaking to me, and I didn't care whether I survived the DTs or not. One thing I knew for sure, though, live or die I never wanted to feel this way again.

I knew what I had to do. I had been to AA meetings before, and quite frankly, I hated those people with their silly cliches and their stupid ""I'm SO happy to be sober today"" bullshit. I hated being sober, but I knew that it was either get sober or die, and I had two kids that would probably be pretty sad if their dad died.

So I decided that I would go back to AA. More importantly, I decided that I would really try to do what they suggested. I asked a guy to be my sponsor my first night back, even though I didn't think he could help me. I decided to read through the Big Book, and let my sponsor teach me how to do the steps, even though I was sure they would do me no good.

Man, am I glad I was wrong.

Today I am one year sober. I have a job that I like. My kids are back living with me again. I have friends who don't drink, both in AA and not. I have been given a second chance at life.

I tried to thank my sponsor this morning. He told me that I could thank him best by carrying the message of AA to other alcoholics, helping those in need, and giving back to others what I was freely given. I am more than happy to do so.",

Just some background. I was a multi-user but ultimately ended up on Heroin (IV Usage) as I had a soft spot for opiates, and they had one for me. I thought I'd share a few tricks that have helped me get where I am today.

1. Take it slow. As they say in the book, easy does it.

2. Don't overthink! Our brain is busted, it gets us into trouble. When you are overthinking on something call someone up (preferably someone sober) and share your thought. ""Hey am I crazy or is it... ...?""

3. Form a support network! If you have a sponsor, awesome, but your sponsor cannot always take your call. My sponsor had me call 3 women every day to check in, now I have the most amazing friendships anyone could ask for. (Call men if you are a man.)

4. Be honest. Even if it is a white lie, call yourself out on it! Eventually we'll justify some dishonesty, and we cannot hold onto our old ideals, look where they got us in the first place!

5. Set boundaries. If someone is talking about a subject to you and it makes you uncomfortable, speak up and tell them you would rather not discuss this right now. (This is one area I've had to work on for a while, and now that I've been setting boundaries I can't stop. It's amazing.)

6. Reach out and share about even the most painful past, chances are someone has been through the same thing and can offer you support. Eventually after you speak so much the pain goes away. I can openly and honestly say today that I was a victim of sexual abuse. I used to hate people that spoke up about it, because I was not dealing with it properly.. then in meetings I started to talk about it. The more I spoke, the less it hurt.

7. Let go. Things are going to happen and often we psyche ourselves out before it even happens and chances are if you are like me... Me psyching myself out was WAAAAY worse than the actual event. Don't obsess, just accept there are things in life we cannot control. We cannot control people, places, or things. We can control our reactions and our emotions to them. Generally things end up a bit better if we take a more accepting attitude towards them.

8. Freaking out about something? Take a step back and reflect on how you are feeling, and why you are feeling it. I have anxiety, and sometimes certain things trigger an overwhelming out of anxiety. I often catch myself and take a step back and walk away if I am freaking out on anyone. Then I go back and tell them what is going on, and offer amends or an apology if needed.

9. Let yourself feel. You're sober now! Feeling is a gift, as well as a curse, but more often than not these sober days we feel great that we can feel again and experience life as it is; not how WE perceive it to be. Earlier this year I had 2 family deaths within 2 days of each other, and 3 recovery-based deaths in the follow 2 weeks. It hurt, and I was sad. You know what? It is OK to cry, and it is OK to be sad! Let yourself feel it, don't hold it in. This is your new life and things like death are a natural part of life, and we must accept it will happen.

10. And finally.. it gets better. No matter where you are, what you are doing, whom you meet, what you go through. It will always get better. Some of my most painful memories have turned into my most valuable lessons that I can now share and pass on to people who are going through the pain I went through.

Also, as a reminder.. have you gone back to the hospital you detoxed in (if you went to one) and thanked the people that helped you? I did today, and they confessed they wished more people came and visited to show them their progress. They care, and they were also the ones who helped you, not only your sponsor, the meetings, and your high power.

Thank you, and if no one has told you they loved you today, damn it I do. :)",
"2 weeks sober!
Today marks two weeks clean from alcohol and drugs. I feel good. I feel great, but even. I know it's a pink cloud and I know it will end. Keeping busy. Embracing life. If I can get two weeks clean, ANYBODY can get clean.",
"Addict who just did what he is hoping is his last shot.
It's time to stop. I'm a closet addict who really wants to put his addiction behind him and has come to reddit for support and someone to talk to. I'm growing tired of the daily grind and sick of making all the wrong decisions just to get my fix. Not only am I hurting myself but my friends and family as well.

"So I relapsed yesterday
My clean date was October 3rd 2015. My drug of choice was heroin. I got on suboxone in August 2015 and got into an outpatient rehab, and started hitting meetings, something clicked and I had commitments, a sense of responsibility and accountability. My sponsor who had 12 years clean relapsed around my one year mark, he died not too long after, liver cancer. As time went on I no longer had cravings for drugs, the obsession had been lifted. I stopped going to meetings all together, I've probably been to one in the past 6 months. I stopped calling my sponsor, and working my steps, I was on 6&7. And last night I found an opportunity,  to take some ecstasy, and to be honest I had a fun time, obviously I know how to get clean when I need it, but I guess I had a reservation this whole time, seemingly exclusively for ecstasy. Has my life spun out of control yet? No. Do I even regret it? I don't think so. And for some reason I just feel like I know better than to return to hard drugs, even after this slip up - that's it I just needed to get that off my chest.",
"How can somebody that is not an addict help someone who is?
Hi, I recently graduated from a social work program and i am working with people with addictions. One thing i have noticed is that most of my coworkers are in recovery themselves, and our clients seem to really benefit from having someone that knows what theyre going through. 
My question is, as someone who has never had addiction personally or even in my family, what can I do to help my clients? I feel like there will always be that extra something missing because i lack the life experience.",
"Lost and feeling alone.
Hi everyone.",
"Losing interest in AA
Hey guys, something has been on my mind for a while. 

The 1st of the month will be 2 years for me. I started my recovery in a 6 month sober living environment that preached AA and mandated church on Sundays. I'm not religious and church was just a thing I did to stay in the program. I found some sort of spirituality and worked the steps with a sponsor.

 I eventually moved and found a different sponsor with long term sobriety, who told me essentially that I knew nothing of the program, and we started over. He's a great guy, and I wanted what he has. I was. Having a lot of issues in life at the time, with my relationship, as well as a pretty devastating house fire, and he ended up getting deeply involved in my relationship problems, and distancing himself when I stuck with her.

Through this whole year for various reasons I'd find myself getting further away from AA, coming back for a month, leaving for a month, working the steps, not working the steps, etc. Without an urge to use, while life and my ability to react to it steadily improved.

In a little over a week I will celebrate 2 years with no interest in turning back, with my mental health better than ever, my relationship better than ever, etc. At this point I haven't been to a meeting in 2 months, and prior to that I would say I've been to a combined, maybe 4 meetings I'm the past 6 months. I don't miss it. I keep in contact with 1 buddy who is in the program, and he doesn't judge me for it, but at this point I've been to probably 100 different meetings in 2 counties, and I've never found that group that clicks, or those anchor people who stick with me through it all.

I don't hold any grudges against AA for not having what I want, and I don't miss the meetings or the people.

I'm sure I'm not the only person who originally drank the Kool aid, and then developed a distaste for it as I readapted to life.

Do you have a similar story?",
"I've been clean for a little over 9 months.
I'm in a therapeutic community and I've been in treatment for the past 9 months and still have 3-4 months left in residential treatment. I'm so used to being sober in the facility, and even at home, when i'm allowed to come home for a home request. I'm a bit scared for when I transfer down and left to my own devices.",
"Tired of falling off the wagon
Hi all, today is my first day sober, I've been actively trying to get sober for over 6 months now. I go through the withdrawals, feel awesome the next day, then make it for anywhere between 5 and 15 days before I get bored and end up buying another bottle, going on a month long binge and restarting the cycle.

What can I do differently this time? I'm so tired of shaking and sweating and vomiting, and want it to stick this time. What am I doing wrong.",
"5 days sober... and it is so much harder than I ever expected
I never thought i had a problem with drinking, everyone around me always rationalized it and I was having a blast. Party nights turned into drinking every night at home by myself, blacking out and making who knows what kind of mistakes. Drinking became my life, my shoulder to lean on,  and despite my knowledge of knowing addiction runs in my family I continued to feed into it because it was harmless. My brother died and it got way worse, I found myself annoyed at anywhere I went that didn’t have alcohol available for me, drinking at least 5 whiskeys at night just to be able to sleep.  I have woken up with wounds not knowing where they came from at all, and even ended up with a sprained ankle from a drunken night out. So, a few days ago was my birthday. The night before I went hard yet again and woke up on my 24th birthday so filled with shame that this is who I’ve become but I know it isn’t who I am. 

So today I am 5 days sober. This is the longest I have gone without drinking in 5 years. I’m proud of myself, but I can’t help but feel like those around me don’t see it as as much of an achievement than it is for me. I’m happy to see all your stories as it makes me feel encouraged to keep on keepin’ on, it just is so hard at night! I miss my Jim Beam. ",
"I got the chance to experience heartbreak and come out the other end still sober
Man she looked beautiful that night. I remember her meeting her outside of that comedy club. We were both there for a mutual friend who was doing a set, and I made myself look like such an idiot. It was awesome. Thankfully I got to meet her again at a party and we hit it off. She had just gotten out of a relationship with a real bad ending, and wasn't looking for anything serious. But I still managed to let myself fall for her. 

We talked and hung out all the time. The first time she came over we stayed up till 3 in the morning and fell asleep cuddling. Then she started going a little cold on me. She told me not to wait up for her, that she wasn't ready for a relationship right now, but she would be happy for me if I found a relationship with someone else. I told her that if I got serious with someone else I couldn't keep talking to her, because I clearly had feelings for her. She got out of my car and stormed inside without even saying goodbye after that. That's the last time I saw her in person. A couple days later I'm talking to the friends I met her through. My buddy says ""JunkieInAA, I gotta tell you man- she's seeing another guy. It's more serious than you."" 

It hurt to hear, but true friends will stab you in the front. Later that day I broke things off with her. I wasn't gonna bring up the other guy- it was something she told my friends in confidence, and I wasn't going to throw them under the bus for this. She never said a word about the other guy. That hurt too. I also caught a bad cold right at the start of this, so I was both emotionally sick and physically sick. I felt like I was back in rehab.

I'm not normally a relationship guy, and I wanted nothing more than a relationship with her. For the first time I feel like I was a stand up guy in my intimate affairs, and I get burnt. I was fuming the whole time. I was restless, irritable, and discontent. I almost said some very hurtful things to the people I care about. *I almost got loaded*. I couldn't take this any more. I called her and told her I knew about the other guy. We talked for a long time. She told me that I'm a good person, and that it would have worked out with any other girl. By the end of the phone call I realized she didn't set out to hurt anyone. She's just a deeply and profoundly broken person right now. It was the hardest phone call I've made in a very long time. But I could feel the anvil coming off my chest. Afterwords I called my buddy to let him know I spilled the beans. He understood. I told him that I felt like I could finally breathe. 

And here I am, a month later to the day. I didn't hurt anyone, I didn't break any other friendships, I didn't lie to anyone, I didn't burn anything, and most importantly, *I didn't get loaded*. Here I am, well over 2 years sober, and my recovery is not going anywhere. I got to experience heart break for the first time in recovery, and I came out the other side still clean.",
"A simple solution for the complicated person.
I am not a bad person.I am an addict.Understanding that i have a physical allergy to mind and mood altering chemicals,triggered by a mental obsession to use them,and remembering this daily helps me to stay clean and sober.This does not make me immune to the cravings,or preassures of life that make my brain automatically think of relief.After all that IS all we as addicts and alcoholics are chasing in our active addictions right? RELIEF,from situations,from people,from illness,from stress, from boredom,and as ive learned from my experience,OURSELVES.if you think that drugs or alcohol are your problem,you probably aren't an addict.Drugs and booze are but a symptom of a much greater issue,a spiritual one,a personal one.
clean house,help others,dont pick up just for today,or the next ten minutes,and then the next ten minutes.realize you arent alone.thank you for having me here.have a great day.",
"Can’t donate blood
I’m really bummed right now and reminded that no matter how long I stay clean, there will always be reminders of my past. I’ve been so distraught over the Vegas shooting, I had an appointment tomorrow to donate blood. I’m O-, which is the universal type that can go to anyone. 

Since I used to inject drugs (even after 5+ years clean and negative HIV and Hep C tests), I can never donate blood. Ever. I mean, I get it, it just makes me feel tainted and somewhat useless. And also what a waste of valuable blood. 

Guess I’ll look for other ways to help. ",

"I'm just a dopeless hope fiend.

"And it got worse....Holy Monkey Nuts! Enough!!
So, we get Panda Express and head home. Hour drive. We stopped at a rest area. To the left is a broke down car with 2 people inside. To the right, another car with flashlights on inside and someone walking around with a flashlight. We go inside to pee. Come out, and car to the left are quite obviously shooting up. I got in my car and I looked at my husband and said, ""My sobriety does not hinge on another's addiction."" He just told me he was proud of me. Made it the rest of the way home without incident. I'm tired. This day is done. I hugged the kids since they are safe. And now I'm watching forensic files and unwinding. Sleep is in my near future.",
"3000 days
Not really an approved anniversary but like I said 1000 days ago here, I like round numbers.  It's a gift to be sober and I came kinda close a few weeks back to a relapse.  But I went to a meeting, called my sponsor and told the truth. The fact is that I did not pick up so I still have a great life. I am not perfect but I am kicking ass at Step 1, one day at a time.  Thank you all for your support here.  You know who you are.",
"Anyone else having trouble listening to songs that they played often while using drugs?
I've found that I can't listen to Lover's Spit anymore because I had that song on replay at the height of my depression and drug use. Anytime I hear it now it gets me pretty close to crying, which I know is pathetic. 

Anyone else notice something like this or is it just me?",
"Quit ice a month ago
Hey, so im about a month in without using, I'm planning on going to join the army when I get in better shape. I've been running daily and cut all previous plugs to make it hard to get anything. Been a bit depressed, not necessarily for any reason, I just can't stop thinking about how much fun it was even doing mundane shit while on ice, it's ridiculous but its hard to get my mind off it.

"Opiate withdraw in bootcamp

"Stuck in a rut
So I should be happy, when I wake up tomorrow I will have 365 days straight of no drugs/drunking. I have a sponsor, a homegroup, I am the group rep for my AA homegroup and started my own NA group in my area. I did my 12 step work, I bring meetings into rehab facilities, I do dinner and coffee after meetings, set up the rooms, etc. Tonight for the first time I just got up halfway through a meeting and left; I felt like another word was going to drive me to drink, and thankfully I am home still sober now.

The problem is that I feel no change, I see no difference, and am back to where I was a year ago; I gave my gun to a trusted friend last week, but right now I want to go sit in my bathtub and blow my brains out. The only reason I'll never do it is because of my family; I don't care if I die, I just couldn't leave them so selfishly and with such a burden. But if anything, my life is worse now than it was a year ago.

Granted, it is way better than doing heroin and downing bourbon all day, but in a year I have no friends, no girlfriend (not even a fucking sniff in my direction), I lost my apt. and am back at home, and I regressed to a dead-end job with nowhere to go. My criminal/financial background will ensure thay for the better part of a decade none of this will change, I am rejected by every job, turned away from every apt. rental. I'm 26 and I feel like I let life pass by and lost my ability to grab hold of it again.

So I pick up my year tomorrow and I feel hollow inside; I know enough not to drink or pick up, that won't solve anything, but how do you reconcile the total and complete emptiness inside? My family doesn't believe I'm sober, despite literally having scientific evidence via a worker's comp injury (they drug test for worker's comp fyi) that I'm clean, and fewer people want anything to do with me now that I'm clean than when I was out using and drinking.

I am lost; AA/NA obviously aren't working for me, and that is the only answer any health professional has for me. I practice the AA principles but see no value; no one cares, they just know I'm the weirdo that doesn't drink, the outsider no one talks to. I've tried new groups, different cities, different meeting types, I've just gotten to where I the same broken record is speaking every time. Is this me? Am I forgoing my life to sit in these flourescent rooms sipping shit coffee for the next 50 years just so I can say I don't drink?

I coach and play soccer, go to church, I have tried everything I can, I feel like I never fully fit in anywhere. I am always just a little too different, I don't ""get it"" the way others do, I am treading water.

I don't care if anyone answers or reads this, I had to vent this somewhere and my sponsor isn't someone I want to talk to right now. Idk what to do, I feel like I'm always going nowhere fast.",
"Found this subreddit by searching ""addiction"". Had a relapse. Need support.
I'm so incredibly mad at myself. I don't have an alcohol or drug addiction, but I was addicted to self injury and from what I know about other addictions, it feels exactly the same way. I went nine months without cutting at all and then two nights ago I lost it and now I just keep staring at my fucked up arm. I had been so proud of how far I have come, and I feel so shitty that I have to start all over. At the same time, I feel like this relapse does not define me, and it's not necessarily starting over, it's just a....hiccup? Bump in the road? I don't really know. But what would you tell someone in your circle (AA, NA, anything like that) who was doing really well and then had a relapse? Don't worry about tailoring it to my situation, what advice would you give them? (I'm 29 and I know I'm far too old to be doing this, I have many psychiatric issues, I'm not asking for help with the SI itself, I'm just wanting help on not letting this relapse bring me back to where I was.)",
"9months clean and CANT stop thinking
Looking for some advice out here from fellow R's in R! I'm a few days shy from getting 9 months clean and sober. During the last year of my using, I was hospitalized well over 20+ as a direct result from drugs and alcohol (mostly vodka and iv dilaudid). I was determined, absolutely determined to figure out a way for there to be ANYTHING wrong with me other than alcoholism. After nearly killing myself multiple times, I was fortunate enough to have been brought into treatment and things started to turn around for me. I like sobriety today. I'm in The Program, have a sponsor, a homegroup, on the monthly vivitrol injection, and slowly making my amends-all a day at a time. 
I am just going totally batshit crazy with this one thing...from sun-up to sun-down the past two weeks all I can think about is getting high JUST ONCE. Now I know I can't safely do this. There's no such thing as ""shooting up like a normal person"", but my mind feels like it's determined to trick me into thinking  that it's possible. Am I in relapse mode and not aware of it? That thought alone scares me. I learned all about the cycles of relapse while in treatment and I can't seem to identity where I stand. I feel like I'm crossing all my T's and dotting all me I's! Is this common for early recovery? Please share with me your experience, strength, and hope! Stay in the love ya'll!

"That ""fuck it"" feeling
I'm 60 days clean from a 2 year relapse. The last time I was sober for 2 years and didn't really use as much as this time. I'm recovering from a severe adderall/alcohol/steroid addiction. I've hit a point after a couple resentments where all that is going through my brain is fuck it. I don't want to get high but I don't want to do work. I don't want to listen to anybody and I'm all over the place.
Stoked on life one second then restless, irritable, and discontent the next.
Idk if it's a chemical imbalance or what's going on. I just feel like right now I would rather sit in my own shit then do what I have to do, it feels comfortable and I don't know why. Idk maybe someone can help me out. Thanks

"Just found this subbreddit, I am approx. 227 Days Sobor
I found this subreddit stumbling across some recovery blogs. I am currently 19 years old. I went through cocaine addiction after the loss of my father at the age of 17 when he seemed to be the one person in my life helping me get myself together. I felt lost without him and had already trifled with weed and cocaine prior to his death. As you would imagine my addiction became full blown which of course I was in complete denial of as I continued to steal thousands of dollars from my mom's boyfriend (who is one of the nicest people ive ever met and would do anything for us). I admitted my problem and decided it was time to admit defeat on March 27'th 2016. I dropped out of my university in hopes of finding that image of myself in the mirror that I recognized as a good person before all of the turmoil. I went to a rehabilitation center at the age of 18 and found myself very involved in the outpatient therapy program at the center. I slowly began to see myself heal and grow from all the pain I thought would never end. I eventually began to see the signs of damage throughout my life and recognized how fortunate and lucky I was to be alive today. I am now as said 227 days into sobriety and could not be happier. I live a positive and full life without NA or AA meetings (just my preference if you feel that meetings work for you then I completely encourage it, there are tons of great people in meetings). I just wanted to let the people struggling to know that no matter how deep the bottom of the barrel is that your drowning in, you can always eventually breach the surface, and by staying afloat that surface your no longer trying to fight your demons, they will always be with you. You are simply learning to live above them and move forward with your life without any monkeys on your back trying to pull you back under.

EDIT: If there are any addicts who ever feel like they need to talk I am more than willing, simply inbox me on reddit and I will respond ASAP.",
"Sometimes I miss the life
I miss the thrill of finally being able to get high after waiting. I miss walking through the sketchy neighborhoods with the cracked sidewalks and abandoned buildings to meet the man. I miss dodging the cops. I miss the rush I would feel just from getting back on the train, safe and sound after another pickup.

Then I remember that I woke up this morning feeling pretty good. I remember that I didn't have to bust out a line just to get rid of the aches and sniffles. I remember that I didn't have to spend hundreds of dollars on drugs this week. I remember that I didn't have to worry about my roommate walking in on me or the cops stopping me. I remember that I didn't have to snort powder in order to feel happy today. Sure, one isolated day of getting high feels better than one day of sobriety, but the life of a sober person is much more fulfilling than the life of an addict.",
"I went to a NA Meeting really high... And feel horrible about it.
I've started hitting up meetings over the past couple weeks, to try and rid myself of all these drug addictions. I've managed to stop taking benzos, and crack cocaine, but have still been using meth and opiates. 

My brain is so fried, I don't even really feel high off anything, except crack anymore... But for whatever reason, when I got to the meeting, being around all those people, the bright ass lights, the hydromorphone kicked in full tilt. I was nodding off and could barely keep my eyes open. To top things off, I was 15 mins late. I could tell a cpl guys were visibly upset, and one even got up and left the meeting. 

I was high at all 6 previous meetings, on more drugs, but kept my composure to where no one knew. Those meetings really helped me start kicking the drugs, and I picked up alot of good insight. I really liked that group, but feel bad. I will apologize next time I go. 

In hindsight, wait till after the meeting if you're gonna get high, but preferably, don't get high at all. 

Anyway, celebrating day 1 and heading to an AA meeting, since there's no NA meetings tonight",

We are strong enough to recover as long as we are honest and willing.  I have been praying this every day. May my heart always be fresh and willing to do WHATEVER it takes to recover. 


Dear Jesus. 

I trust in you, I make myself 100% available to you today. Keep the desire for transformation alive in my heart. Help me to believe that a new beginning is possible. Jesus, teach me to never stop seeking you. Help me to seek you in every relationship, place, and situation. Give me the courage to let down my guard. Thank you for all the times you have invited me to discover you, and your message. Help me not to squander this opportunity and to grow out of my doubt and unbelief .  Jesus point me towards the root of things and give me the extra nudge when I am tempted to settle for the shallow and the superficial. thank you for revealing yourself to me and thank you for all you have done for me. Thank you for loving me more than I love myself. Give me the strength to say no to myself and have mercy on me. Save my soul from my sins.

"Think I might be an alcoholic
Ok so, I'm 19 and have been drinking for 4 yrs. It started off fun but over time it began to give me, more and more problems. 

By 16, I was blacking out on a daily basis, drinking from the time I woke up, etc. I became physically deoendent on it and had withdrawal symptoms if I went to long without a drink. It got bad and messy. But when I left for college at 18, I actually managed to stay sober most of the time.

When I dropped out (money issues) and returned home my drinking picked back off. Basically my parents allow me to drink in the house as long as I'm contributing money for the alcohol. We go through several handles of vodka, bottles of wine and cases of beer a week. Which doesn't help, when it's always there/in my face. 

I feel like I'm either drunk or thinking about getting drunk all the time. About a month ago, I blacked out on a bus at 8am and woke up across town with no recollection. I go into work drunk all the time. I'm scared of losing my job or hurting myself.

I've made an effort in the last month or so to cut back after my mom was diagnosed with cancer but I still drink on a daily basis. 

I'm in a shitty place. I'm depressed and anxious. I don't have friends, I'm lonely. I'm scared I'm an alcoholic, but aren't I too young?

Would appreciate some advice. 

tl;dr; Rough relationship with alcohol. Worried I'm an alcoholic.",

"We are 10 days clean today.
10 days clean.. rolling into the 11th day per my sober tracker on my phone. Feels good man.
 
We have been married for 3 years and spent 1.5 of the last of those years doing dope. If we can do this *anybody* can. I know 10 days doesn't sound like a very long time but how I feel today compared to 10 days ago is night and day. Things are getting easy now. I can take walks everyday and I don't throw up all the time. I am starting to sleep regularly and I no longer wake up drenched in sweat and tears. I no longer want to *kill* myself nor do I have to worry about what I'm going to pawn, steal, or lie to for my next fix. I am no longer scared of being dope sick. Even my husband is finally starting to feel normal again and he's been on opiates for a long time due to back issues and doctors over prescribing to addicts. 

Do not give up! If you relapse it's only a step back towards your recovery. We relapsed too many times before we couldn't take it anymore. The more you relapse the worse it does get because you know exactly what's coming next. 

Pick yourself up and do whatever you need to do to get clean. 

Personally, outpatient programs did not work for us, and that's okay. We found what works and we're doing it. The only thing that worked for us was hitting our personal rock bottoms and feeling like there's no way in hell we could keep going anymore without our friends and family finding out we had major issues-  and now there is no turning back. No returning to that life. We've gotten more done in the last 10 days than we have in MONTHS or even the last year. We have a lot of repairing still to do but the feels man. They are so good. I can't wait until we hit the 30 day mark and I can look at all the progress that's been made!",
"Hi my name is Goat and I'm an addict.
Today is day 19 for me. I used cannabis daily for 10 years and benzos for 2 prior to kicking my addictions. I was in a sober living house that I recently had to leave because of alcohol and drug use still being promoted. I came back to my home town where I initially left as to not get drawn back into old habits. I'm having a difficult time as everything reminds me of the party. I'm definitely glad I made this decision and fortunately am backed by my family 100% I have a great sponsor.  The hardest thing for me is getting a job as I was a farmer of cannabis for the last 6 years (since I was 18) and will soon be on some sort of probation for a DWI I got in December. I can't find any meetings close enough to get to so I'm hoping to find friends here to help with my recovery. Stories and advice are welcome. Thanks for reading my post and in advanced fo any support I am glad to be apart of the sober community finally!",
"It's not about feeling good. It's about what you do when you feel bad.
Early in sobriety, someone told me this, and it's had quite a profound impact on me. When I abstained from all mind-altering substances and began to work a program of recovery, I saw my life improve in multiple areas. Of course I began to feel very good about my life. But I had to remember not to get overly excited or too proud of myself - because I can't maintain a mindset where I expect my life to be perfect after drugs and alcohol, then find myself unable to cope with reality when things are less than perfect.

It's easy to forget we are addicts when our lives going well. So it's okay to be proud of ourselves when we finally decide to quit and work a program of recovery. But don't fall into the ""pink cloud"" trap of expecting everything to be wonderful forever. Getting sober won't rid your life of problems. But it will allow you to face and overcome your problems with a clear mind. ",

Muscles on fire

In misery

It seems to be

Understand me

Or what its like

To constantly

Be up or down

No middle ground

Its sink or swim

It's been a rough 24 hours at work. Our branch was short $500 last night due to an error receiving our cash shipment. I force proved the branch knowing it had something to do with the shipment. I was already feeling shame today and then I was brought upstairs and reprimanded by my supervisor. This just added to my embarrassment. I began to think the worse and began fearing for my job. I was then sent to lunch. The whole lunch time I couldn't eat. All I could do was sit in my car and recite the Serenity Prayer over and over. The idea of getting a couple of shots after work felt like it was just what the doctor ordered. Then I began thinking where I could acquire some weed to be able to keep the tranquility going. I talked myself out of it but this time it was for real. The urge was intense. I began thinking about the ""joys"" of using. The feelings have subsided now because they found the missing $500 on the armored car never delivered. But today could have been bad. I'm grateful it wasn't. Thanks for letting me share. ",
"Tomorrow marks 1,000 days sober for me. I want to celebrate with my SO in a small way and need ideas.
I'm a recovering alcoholic and tomorrow I will hit 1,000 days sober. I made a mental note of this milestone about six months ago and have been counting down ever since. 

Now it's almost here and I have no idea how to celebrate it. I told my SO id like to do something small to celebrate and of course he's enthusiastically on board. I know it's my fault for planning last minute but I would ideally like to do something meaningful related to my recovery rather than just go out to dinner or something. If we end up doing dinner that is absolutely enough, but before I settle on that I wanted to see if you guys have any suggestions. How have you celebrated your sobriety milestones?

A few ideas I had:

1) fancy mocktail bar: I love making fun,  non alcoholic drinks, but I usually just settle for soda since it's a hassle to buy a bunch of supplies. I was thinking I could splurge and get the fancy ginger beer (non alcoholic) I love, candied ginger, syrups, sugar rim, the works and fix me and my boyfriend an awesome non-alcoholic treat.

2) I could go back to the restaurant where I had my last drink ever and order food. I haven't been back there since I got sober. It could be cathartic but I'm worried it might just bring me back and remind me of that hell.

3) I recently got a raise and I've been saving for a new computer. I might just splurge and buy it tomorrow as a present to myself, then go out to a nice dinner.

I'm excited to hear your suggestions!",
"Life in Recovery: Day 138
Hello, reddit community. I have been in recovery for 138 days (working on 5 months) as I write this post and wanted to try something new. Since I began my journey, I have been writing in a personal journal and came to a realization: recording my thoughts and experiences helps me... but I want to be there for and help others. Active addiction can feel dark and hopeless, hurting yourself and those you love, but I have found a freedom from that darkness and I want others to know that it does exist and you can find it for yourself! 

That leads me to my recovery journal. It is extremely important for me to reflect on my daily life and, if nothing else, my recovery journal will help to keep ME clean for another day. I can only hope that it helps YOU to stay clean as well. Now, a little background...

I am 25 years old and had used some type of drug since I was 16. It started with marijuana and quickly went downhill from there. Marijuana to LSD to Mushrooms to Ecstasy to Opiates and, finally, ending with Heroin. I have a DUI, 2 counts of Disorderly Conduct, 2 counts of Possession and 2 counts of Paraphernalia on my criminal record. I was fired from my first full-time job at 23 because of my drug use. I lost another full-time job at 24 because of my drug use. During this last relapse, I totaled my car and nearly killed myself by overdosing. Above all, I have felt the complete apathy and hopelessness that comes with spiritual death and desperation. 

I have an incredible girlfriend who has supported me throughout this entire process. In February of 2014, I was arrested for Possession/Paraphernalia and went to jail. When I was released, I confessed to her that I was a heroin addict and that I needed help. I drove back to my parents house with her and confessed to my parents as well. I had kept it hidden from those closest to me for as long as I possibly could because I was always so ashamed of what I was doing. On February 7, 2014, I went to rehab for the first time. The program was heavily AA/NA based and that is the approach that I learned. I stayed the full 28 days and went home in March. I was clean for about 60 days, attending meetings, talking to my sponsor, etc. when I relapsed. I went back to rehab on May 7, 2014, and stayed for another 28 days. When I left, I felt like I knew exactly what I was doing. This was going to be it. I was wrong. Shortly after 90 days clean, I relapsed again, but this time I started using kratom instead of heroin and kept it hidden from my loved ones for a few months. I couldn't keep it hidden for long...

On January 5, 2015, I decided that I had had enough and was going to pick up some dope. On my drive home, I totaled my car. The very next day, January 6, 2015, I decided to get high before I left for work and I ended up overdosing. I woke up on my living room floor with paramedics and police officers everywhere. I had absolutely no idea what had happened. Everything was blurry and I couldn't make out what the sounds were. It wasn't until I was at the hospital hours later that I found out my kidneys had completely shut down and, if my girlfriend would not have called 911 when she did, I would have died on the living room floor, alone, leaving behind a trail of sadness and despair. 

January 7, 2015 is my clean date. I chose not to go back to rehab because I know exactly what needs to be done: I need to follow through now. That was 138 days ago and a lot has happened since then. I got a new job coaching soccer and was able to afford a new car for myself. My relationship with my girlfriend and parents has never been better. I purchased a gym membership and have been exercising 3-5 times per week. I stopped drinking soda and have been eating (mostly) healthy foods. The program and fellowship of AA/NA has helped me out quite a bit, but I have found that there is more to it than that. There is more to recovery (for me) than just talking about it with a group of addicts. I have made a great effort to change my thoughts and beliefs about who I am and what I am capable of. My addiction tells me I am no good and I will never be able to accomplish what I want to accomplish. My heart tells me otherwise... Recovery is possible for all of us. This post is lengthy because it is my first one. My goal is to record one post per day to serve as my personal recovery journal and to, hopefully, give some strength to a fellow addict.

Please, love yourself.

"Merry Christmas
I'll be 10 months sober tomorrow on Christmas Day - ten months further away from the beginning of the end, when I was coming down during dinner and planning to buy more meth that night. 

There is A LOT to be happy about, but the holiday and some foggy, somber weather make me think about a bunch of people I've met that are still active today, if not dead. 

8 months in a sober house, working my program and seeing people come and go equals a lot of individuals is gotten close to in a short time. Most of them, once they leave they are never to be heard from again. 

Whatever you define as your recovery, do it for yourself: do it so YOU and be YOU, and present. 

It's tough to think about the past. There are wonderfully fun but also terrifying memories, not mutually exclusive, which revolve around my drinking and drugs. And in the past I didn't have these worries about near strangers, their lives, sobriety, families & lives. 

Just rambling. Thanks. ",
"I have 1,364 days sober, and the liquor store opens in three hours. NSFW - language.
So, yup, title lays it out. 

Basically, I'm just shy of two years; nine months.

I have been thinking about drinking for quite some time now.

Sat and discussed cocktails with my boyfriend, of course, he suggested all this frilly shit, and all I want is vodka tonics and maybe some Powerade.

I make the argument that I am a man - I can make my own choices.
I just am a bad person, I guess. Weak, even. OUT OF CONTROL.

Succumbing to alcoholism.

I feel like it's gonna take me, and I'm powerless to stop it.

I don't go to meetings.

I don't read my Big Book.

I don't have a sponsor.

I was reminded this morning that I have *nothing*, which is true, at this point, I do have *nothing*.

I know that if I drink, I will fucking die. Jails, institutions, and death, OH MY! I know that if I drink, I'll be in handcuffs by sunset.

I am making a poor choice, because I am fucked up.

What is that stupid saying about being sick men? Yeah, plug that one in here, I need to read that. OH, I remember - we're not bad people trying to get good; we're sick people trying to get well. Well, I quit.

I cannot stop crying right now, because I am a little bitch. I am being a little bitch. 

The last couple of days have just been a catalyst to me relapsing. I just didn't know when, and today's the day. Today's the day I get loaded. 

It's actually surprising - it's about 50/50 to those who think it's okay for me to drink, versus those who don't. But, then again, those people don't matter.

I am a mean, angry, violent drunk. I know this. I am a mean, angry, violent, vindictive son of a bitch.

I have destroyed women. I have destroyed every friendship I ever had. I cause so much wreckage. I hurt people. I hurt people on purpose. Ya know what's worse than that? I am a fucking coward. I have ran from everything I've ever had to deal with in my whole life. When people piss me off - even for the stupidest shit, that's it, they are done. I no longer want them in my life. I can't even keep a friend. 

I don't know if I needed y'all or /r/suicidewatch.

Bonus point; I played [this song](http://listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=pPUe2DaTylM#Scott_Shelby__Burn__OFFICIAL_Music_Video) whilst writing this.

When I remember that I am not entitled to the life I have today, I become grateful for the little things (that are not so little when my perspective shifts).

Today I am grateful to be able to walk, talk, and breathe. I am grateful that my Higher Power relieved me of the obsession to use drugs. I am grateful that I am self-supporting through my own contributions and in good standing at my local library. I am grateful for the relationships I have formed through the program of Narcotics Anonymous. I am grateful for bubble gum, blue skies, and days off for self-care. 

What are you grateful for today, in this moment? Hope everyone has a blessed day. Life clean & sober is better than anything I could've ever imagined. ",
"I'm sick and tired of this struggle
I know I have a drinking problem. I'm not asking if I do; I know I do. I know, in some difficult-to-access part of my brain, that my overall quality of life is significantly better when I stop drinking completely. About a year and a half ago, I went dry for a year. Telling myself that I was going to stop forever was too scary to contemplate, but I could handle finite terms like ""a year"". I wanted to prove to myself that living without it wouldn't make my life worse. And I really did. After 3 months, all of my sleeping problems disappeared. My anxiety plummeted. My self esteem slowly, almost without me noticing, started to make a comeback. I lost weight. I noticed I had been neglecting a lot of hobbies I really loved. It was really hard, but it was really worth it.

But when the year was over, I let myself start drinking again, little by little.

Even after a year, it was still torture to attend any event involving alcohol. I just wanted to leave as soon as possible, and I was still jealous of everyone else. Every event had alcohol, which meant I hated social events of any kind, and I just didn't want to be there. People really start to get upset when you don't go to ANYTHING (eg, weddings), or try to leave an hour after you get there. Yes, quitting alcohol is important, but so are people. Anyway, I wanted to enjoy those things again.

It's some time later and it might sound weird but I wish my alcohol problem was worse. I wish it wasn't so manageable. When I tell my friends I want to quit they act confused and say ""Why?"" When I tell them I'm an alcoholic they laugh and act skeptical. But I'm a petite young girl with a good head on her shoulders- surely alcoholics look like someone else.

I just want to stop fighting this. I'm so tired of always wanting it and always thinking about it. I feel owned by alcohol. I'm exhausted with this struggle. I've been drinking for eleven years, trying to stop for six, and I'm only 24.

It's a struggle when I drink. It's a struggle when I don't drink. The only thing that isn't a struggle is being alone with a bottle of whiskey to myself and no obligations, and who has that? No one I want to be. It's just a neverending battle. Fuck.",

"Wanted to check if I'm off-base
I am a medical student and we are about to start our Behavioral Medicine & Psychiatry portion of our first-year. Today we received an email stating that we could receive extra-credit by attending an open NA/AA meeting, getting a sheet signed saying we attended, and writing a paper about our experience.

As someone in recovery, I felt that this is incredibly disrespectful, especially since I'm from a small area where there is not a single closed meeting. I, consequently, do not feel comfortable attending a meeting until the assignment ends (in almost a month).  I took the time to look up information from NA, who explicitly states that they have meetings specifically for people who want information about the organization. I felt that encouraging students to go to ""gawk"" is not productive, especially considering I heard disparaging comments from fellow students about the people at NA/AA and the organizations themselves after the email went out. 

I sent an email to the course director and the head of our student services asking them to reconsider their encouraging people to attend these meetings, as well as suggesting alternatives (i.e. inviting people to speak about NA/AA or inviting doctors in recovery to speak with us). 

Anyways, I'm kind of rambling, but I felt that the whole thing was just wrong and asked the course director if he would send people to a rape, cancer, or child abuse survivors support group and that NA/AA is a similar place. So, I guess I am just looking for a little validation that my criticism was not off the mark and if it was, why you think I should have just let it slide.

"Struggling on 4/20
Hello My names Justin, and I am an alcoholic. Still love saying that lol. I am 23 years old, have been sober for six months, and enjoy this new lifestyle. It would be important to note the progress I have made in my life these past six months, as it has only been possible through the Alcoholics Anonymous program. The work I've done up to this point (I am on step six with my sponsor) has been crucial to my recovery.

This morning however, I was woken up by my phone, and on it was a list of all the messages, snapchats, and tweets I had received. Social networking is the bane of my recovery. In the majority of messages, who were mostly from people I either haven't seen in a while or people who are unaware of my sobriety, everyone was taking pictures/videos of them taking a nice bong hit and blowing the smoke into the camera. ""Happy 4/20, DUDE!!

So today, I will most likely not be smoking any pot. I am living in an oxford house and I have a coffee commitment at my home group tonight. I needed to share about this though, and I was surprised that someone else from this subreddit hadn't already posted about it.

I often say that once I dove into this program, alcohol became less alluring. Remembering my past, I have truly not wanted to drink very much. Pot however, still has a special place in my heart, and I need to rid myself of my inner pot head. I am working on that.

"Socializing as a sober alcoholic - the AA ""social club"" just isn't cutting it anymore...
Okay, I'm fairly new to reddit, and just discovered the sub-reddit today, so I'm sorry if I am not doing this right. I'm going to try to keep it really short and to the point.

Basically, I am 26 years old woman. I've been sober about 4.5 years in AA. I feel that I have a really solid foundation in recovery - I work closely with a sponsor, attend meetings, work the steps, etc. 

The problem is that I feel that my social life is stunted. Up until this point in my sobriety, I have been really surrounded by a close-knit group of other (mostly young-ish) folks in AA, and my social interactions have kind of revolved around that. You know, late night diner stops, mini golf, board game nights, going to the beach, road trips... I have been pretty fulfilled by this until recently.

I have also fairy recently gotten to the point where I feel okay by myself - the whole idea that just because I'm alone, I don't have to be lonely. What a huge breakthrough that was (and continues to be)! Like, I don't have to hang out in a coffee shop with half a dozen other recovering alkies until late at night to feel comfortable and okay. I can stay in and watch Netflix or read or go to bed early, and still feel pretty fulfilled.

The fact is, I have very few non-alcoholic friends. In fact, anything close to a romantic relationship I've had in the last 4 or so years has come from the rooms (that could be a whole different post, but I don't need to get into that now). I have found myself recently becoming incredibly irritated with my AA friends. It feels like a really high school scene... always tons of drama... people way too into my business (and I'm probably too into theirs as well, to be fair). And the incessant need to be talking about recovery or our various neuroses or issues or last night's meeting or... blah, blah, blah. 

I would really like to get out into the ""real world"" and experience a little bit more of a social life with my peers - non-alcoholic ones. The problem is, I have no idea how to do this. I am a full-time student, so I guess there are some opportunities in school, but whenever I have tried to make an effort with a girl at school it seems like she's kind of got her life all set and isn't really all that interested in making time for a new friendship. I'd love to go to a bar for the social scene, but I haven't been in that setting very much since I stopped drinking, and I feel as though it may be awkward. I work two jobs, but not really the type work with the opportunities to form new relationships. I live in a pretty small city and I don't know what I, as a single young female, can do to meet new people. I consider myself very outgoing and friendly, but I feel as though there is no forum in which to exercise these skills.

Anyone have a similar experience? Share, please. :)

Just writing that sentence sends a wave of relaxation through my body that I thought could only ever come from drugs. Or - that I had only ever known through drugs. But two years ago today I stubbed out a joint, opened the car door, dropped the joint and dropped out the bag too. 

'Twas the first *choice* I had made in years, but not the last rubbish I had to dump.

When I first heard about ""honesty, open mindedness and willingness"" all I had was willingness, but that was enough - that first night in the rooms I heard stories from those with 3 weeks, 3 months, 3 years serenity, and their stories felt like mine. So I opened my mouth and started talking, and have not stopped since.

The honesty, when it ""turned up"" came as a bit of a shock, I was **not** expecting that one! I have been telling lies and stealing and such as far back as I can remember. And I only wanted help with the addiction, not with me! A conscience was a bloody awkward thing to carry around for a while, but I assume there must have been a conscience-sized hole in here somewhere, because it seems to fit much better these days. And then the feelings! I try to share about feelings whenever I see newcomers in the rooms, because they should be warned, certainly I *should* have been warned. I will always appreciate the member who advised me to just sit down long enough alone till I knew the name for the feeling I was having. The next few weeks were a roller-coaster ride, which I am still on, and still enjoying. Sometimes I (still) do not know the names, and some of my most inarticulate sharings have started with ""I feel ..."", but I love having them - I missed so much I should cry. But actually I smile, I am so full of gratitude that often I just have to stop, calm down, look around, appreciate how wonderful the life around me and within me is. Sometimes, most times, all I have to do is be honest, really honest about the gifts I have, the life I have, that I cannot understand how I got so far away from myself. And all I really had to do was talk honestly and listen honestly.

Took a bit longer to open my mind (and lately it has become less open again) because the ""theory"" behind it all is *very hard* for a [skeptic](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic) [ignostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignostic) like me. I'm reading more [Stanton Peele](http://www.peele.net/7tools/index.html) than [Bill W](http://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/en_bigbook_chapt4.pdf) these days, and I've spent a lot of time reading [The Orange Papers](http://www.orange-papers.org/), [Stinkin Thinkin](http://stinkin-thinkin.com/) and the like. I don't honestly think I would have survived this long in NA without them, but my recovery is more important than [your doorknob](http://adventureswithlarry.com/articles/article_doorknobs.php), and also more important than [my reason](http://youarenotsosmart.com/). So I keep going and find [rooms online](http://www.intherooms.com/), and [other](http://lifering.org/) [groups](http://forum.moderation.org/forumdisplay.php?2-MM-Main-Forum), even [magazines](http://www.thefix.com/features). And, of course, you wonderful, argumentative, helpful, beautiful [redditors here](http://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY). Every now and then I need a whack upside the head, and so many times it turns out I don't need it after all after a few replies here. [Thank you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXWZAprfUmQ) for that. 

On my first night in the rooms, 2 years ago, they gave me a [white](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sfhvxTZ0wo) key ring and told me I'd have to keep coming back to get the [black one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl6s1x9j4QQ). Like any [cool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF7XRH8DJzU) addict I wanted to be [Mr Black](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/quotes?qt=qt0943200), so I knuckled down, took on the suggested things one by one, found [a sponsor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU), [work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsoa1wHJT2E)ed [the steps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teEsNn7YuKI) and ... it worked for me. But I only did all that for the [black](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjjpBb9q1PA) key ring, so tonight I dumped some [more rubbish](http://imgur.com/xrZuF.jpg), and chose to go to a meeting because [I enjoy them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Qwg5x7kc8).",
"Functional alcoholic on my second day sober. Any advice on how to proceed?
Tuesday I finally admitted I have a problem to myself. I have since told my family, and my closest loved ones. 
Yesterday, I sought out counseling for my associated depression. 

I have researched AA meetings in my area but must admit I am turned off by the group setting.

I need help and I would like as much advice as your collective experience can provide on how I should start my road to recovery. 
What should I do?",
"Has anyone heard of the line of sponsorship where the rule is “nothing from the neck up” where they don’t even allow psych meds? And they don’t consider you sober if you take any? What are your thoughts on this?

"I've been watching the end result for 2 months now. I'm 30 days clean as a result.
I've been in and out of this subreddit for a couple years now. Struggling. Relapsing. Over and over. 3 months ago, I got a call. My mother was in the hospital. I rushed across the state. The next two months, I watched as alcoholism killed her. She died a month ago. I watched as the once vibrant, ferocious woman I knew dissolved before my eyes. She was just gone. The legacy she left was horrifying. Yellow skin, yellow eyes. She couldn't talk. She couldn't open her eyes. If she did, the only thing that you could see were yellow globs in the corners of her eyes and pure, unadulterated pain and fear. It broke me. I've never sobbed like I did the day she finally let go. I let go that day too. I forgave her. I begged for forgiveness. One thing became very clear to me. I will not leave this world the same way. I'm an IV meth addict. I will not leave that legacy to my children. For 30 days and some change, I've not used. I will never get my mother's face out of my head. Its possibly the most horrifying thing I've ever seen. And I've been to war. I need support. I have a beautiful family. A loving husband in recovery, 4 beautiful children and I'm a Grandma to 2 beautiful boys. I will not allow them to suffer as I have. I want her back desperately. I won't let her die in vain.",
"Just came upon this sub. I've been 5 months sober. Longest I've gone yet.
I liked a lot of drugs. They where my thing, they brought great experiences to life for some part of it. I think cannabis is fine and still smoke it better than all the Anti Phycotics, SSRI's, Seroquel. Those just added on to the mental state I was in. I never had a thing for opiates, never ever touched heroin or meth etc. That I knew was a cut off line for me as far as drugs go. I was deep into coke at one point but adderall replaced that. My vices where always the Benzos, and ADHD meds (Adderall,Vyvanse, etc.). Anyway the benzo was the worst of it. The withdrawals are excruciating. I made it through that but what made me stop benzo was I went on a hike alone, not a big one just around a hill really on the side of a road that people went to. I had only brought some maxi bars and a sleeve of shooters. Gobbled that shit like candy and killed the sleeve. Then that's all I remember. Next thing I woke up in a hospital with my parents and brother sitting by my side. The look on there eyes....POWERFUL! What had happened is I bartard blackout and a lady on the hike where I was saw me laying on this boulder on the edge of a little cliff. Well she calls 911. Shout out to this lady though I owe her my life. When the fire truck, the ambulance, and some sheriff's final arrived as soon as they saw me I feel 20 feet on to a little overhang. LUCKY...there was another 20 feet or so before a jagged patch of boulders. 
The sheriff then carried me from that ledge all 180lbs of me. To be checked out and I was found with some bars still left and got charged for those but no public intoxication. I signed well to on the ticket though too quick I barely remember. So at the hospital I was all attached to censors and a IV. They gave me some cat scans and nothing turned up. All I ended up with was a black eye and some scraping on my legs. I had smacked my face on the side of a boulder on the overhang and that's how received a black eye. I got out that night. The next day me my dad got up and went by the place I feel and to our surprise the sheriff that carried me was at that hiking location. Watching for speeders on the road. So I went up to him and thanked him for all he did. Truly one of the most grateful moments in my life. Well since that time it's been a year and a half in recovery there have been bumps but that's all part of the process. I'm thankful for my family, and the true friends who have been so supportive in my journey.

SO: to all the people just starting to recovering and to the people still keeping it up cause your never done fighting the harm.

The things I can take from the last year is stay away from jail and that Hindsight is 20/20.

Thank you for listening!",
"Day 16 CLEAN & SOBER.
Not sure why I deleted my last post but I did. I guess my thoughts go a mile a minute! Been trying to analyze my thoughts and emotions and control my actions more so than I use to, even when I did have a decent amount of sobriety. Getting clean TO ME is so much more than just not using or not drinking, I have to change everything! I choose to work a program but I know that it is not for everyone. I have TRIED AND TRIED getting sober on my own but for years I have tried SELF and that has failed me time and time again. I can't do it on my own, I had to ask for help because, well, I CAN NOT HELP MYSELF. Just wanting to get some conversation going! What's going on?!",
"74 days in recovery, boyfriend does cocaine. Please help me.
Hello, Im a 25 year old addict just recently started the NA program. I'm struggling at the moment trying to cope with my relationship with my boyfriend. 

To backtrack a bit, we've been together for more than 3 years and it was initially a great love story. We met traveling and fell absolutely in love. Decided to come live with him in his country. 
I was already quite far in my addiction when we met but it somehow exploded when I moved over. We partied all the time, none of us had jobs, drinking and smoking weed daily until the weekends came where we'd go all in on the hard stuff, binging for days. I was most likely the one pushing for that, and he would just follow. I am tiny and cute but I could drink and get fucked up like a 100kg old veteran named Vladimir from Russia, and still be the last one standing. Nobody could stand a chance. Months went by and he wanted to take things more slowly, he got a stable job, but I was not at all on the same level. I had a seasonal job working 12hrs a day so got pretty heavy into speed at that point. On the weekends I continued the partying. This basically went on for two years, with work for a couple of months and some months being out of activity just feeding my depression and partying away. Started working in a bar, and upgraded the speed to cocaine. Drank like a sailor. Our relationship had already at that point turned quite sour, so many times I came home completely trashed, promising I would quit with the best intentions but never initiated a change. He at that point would stick to the weekend drinking and occasional line of coke or pill. He likes his weed and beers but I would somehow dare to say he's somehow got it under control, he rarely gets too drunk to do bullshit. I was eventually fired from the bar (big surprise), and I hit rock bottom. Decided to go to the NA meetings and now I feel much better. 

During these soon to come 3 months in recovery (if God wills it), he has done cocaine twice. Once was New Years Eve when I had been clean for 3 days. I freaked out, caused a big scene, went home and packed his bags and a big fight happened. We decided to work on it and he promised me he wouldn't do cocaine again when I would be around. He has been very supportive of me in going to meetings and finding compromises about how we will proceed our relationship. He's not smoking weed infront of me or in the house, I've told him alcohol is okay as long as he doesnt get wrecked. 

Last weekend he did cocaine again and I totally lost it again. Mind I say both of the times its been one bump offered from a friend since he never buys it. I know I lost it mosty because I'm jealous that I cant do that anymore but I also feel like trust was broken, he did after all promise me that it wouldnt happen again. My sponsor says I need to put my anger where it belongs but I have a hard time staying objective in the matter and not let my feelings getting in way. 

I dont think I can go on in a relationship with someone who does cocaine when Im around. Even if its once every two months. I tried to talk to him about that and kind of be clear about I want him to live the life he wants, but if cocaine is still in the picture, I cant be with him. What he is doing when Im not around is a question for another time, but when he's with me i want him to stay away from the hard stuff.
Am I even in the position to ask him for that? 
He wants me to be patient the way that he was patient with me and he basically said that these situations will sometimes occur. When I asked how he wants me to be patient and what he wants me to be patient for he couldnt answer me (at that time he was quite upset). I dont think we can compare our situations because I wanted to quit at that time of my life but I was uncapable of doing so. He asked me to remember that 9 out of 10 times he usually says no to that occasional line. But if that is the case why can't he just say no when I'm around? 
I know I initially need to figure out what I want and eventually accept the things I cannot change and maybe walk away from our relationship if I want to stay clean and sober. Last time I was dangerosly close to a relapse and I dont want to go back out there.

The other option would be to not go out at all with him (we are pretty involved in the music scene where we live and sometimes I want to go out and dance to music I like - yes sober!) but I dont find that realistic to never ever go out again and I dont like the thought of another person controlling me in that sense of what I want to do.

Would I ever be able to accept his using? Is there anyone here with some advice, who's possibly been in the same situation? Or just someone who can send me some strength?

I love this guy to death, he is the only guy I've ever loved and actually capable of seeing a future with and the thought of losing him freaks me the fuck out. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks for listening.",

"6 weeks sober
after realizing i was a poly substance addict and going cold turkey on everything (except caffeine, i can handle my bi-weekly coffee) i've noticed that cravings are subsiding. i still dream about getting fucked up almost every night but last night i went to a insane party and i'm happy to say i didn't intake a single substance. i'm known at school for being a drugie so EVERYONE was surprised i was going clean. it was really enlightening.

one thing that stood out to be most of all was one of my drunk buddies pulled me aside and said 'Yo, you're my best friend homje. Ik what you're going through is hell but the fact that you're here and sober proving to this whole fucking town you can have a good time without drugs is proving everyone wrong"". 

that really stood out to me. i was thankful i had such supportive friends and can conclude people do change.

""tomorrow's a new day, live one day at a time"" the last time i was high (6 weeks ago) i came up with this little motto. if you are hurting nothing is stoping you from restarting tomorrow. you can save yourself whenever you want to be saved. finally live one day at a time refers to living decision by decision saying no in a day. it all adds up and being sober is the way i choose to live. 

i'm glad i had fun w drugs and it's a shame i became addicted. i'm done with that part of my life. i'm to young to see my friends around me continue to overdose. here's to a new day.",

So I'm wondering, those of you who've lived with someone with addiction, what were some of the subtle signs that made you question them? Did you know they were using before they really got bad? In the before it was bad phase, were there behaviors that you look at now and think ""I should've known""? Is there anything that isn't obvious that is a no doubt absolute undeniable sign of addiction? 

This is all still really new for me. I want to hear your stories. I feel kind of alone, even though I know I'm not. If I have stories or people to relate to, it will help.",

"I don't believe in god, and because of that, I don't feel like I'm welcome or like I belong in AA or NA
I've been sober for well over 2 years now, and I did the AA steps as best and as earnestly as I could. When I first came in, I told them that I didn't believe in god. They said that that was okay, and to just stick around. I entirely believe they were being honest with me- they had seen their fair share of newcomers who didn't believe in god. But there was always this underlying feeling of ""you don't have to believe in god, **yet**."" 

People would always say ""Oh yeah I had problems with the god thing when I first came in but eventually I changed."" I dont ""have a problem with the god thing,"" I just simply *don't believe in god*. Like, I'm not hating on people who believe in god, I just don't. And really really really earnestly tried, too! Seriously. But imagine someone going ""I have the hope diamond in my pocket"" and when you say ""I don't believe you,"" they say ""well just believe me, it's that simple."" It feels a little condescending, especially when the go-to answer is ""Oh just read We Agnostics again."" Nope, I've read it plenty of times, and it just feels like a lot of really baseless claims about people who don't believe in god. 

If I were to categorize my beliefs I guess agnostic would be the most accurate term. I'm 100% sure there isn't a god of any kind, but I just don't believe in god and can't force myself to. There's a little plausibility when people say ""an addict or an alcoholic can't get sober if they don't believe in god,"" but here I am, well over 2 years later. Idk what to do. I don't wanna go to meetings because I don't want to lie by saying I do believe in god, but I also don't want to actively be telling newcomers ""I don't take part in the fundamental lynch pin idea of this program but I've been sober 2 years btw."" So as a result, I feel unwelcome at meetings, or least like I don't belong there. I don't feel like anyone is out to get me in program or anything like, but whenever I'm in a meeting it just feels like I'm not in the right place.

Is this normal?",
"struggling with existence of life
I am currently serving the last few months of a prison sentence in a halfway house. I haven't ingested any mind altering substance in over ten months but the closer I get to freedom, the more I miss drugs. I am an ex opiate user this last time but have been addicted to multiple substances throughout my life. While I was in prison, I tried to read and find some type of purpose in life. I still am struggling with that. We are all going to die someday. That's pure fact. A fact I can't get over. And it's  killing me. I just don't see what's the purpose to life if we are going to die eventually. Having a soul is believable but I don't feel it in my heart when I speak about it. There's no emotion associated with the belief. I want to believe in a purpose. I just don't seem to be able to grasp it. And this is the cycle of my life. I'm blinded by consumerism, our society, greed, power, the concept of money and stardom. Most people in the world don't care of others. Everyone cares about themselves. Everyone is scared of others. When we are young we are taught stranger danger. There's hate and greed in this world and it seems to be winning. I don't know what to do. ",

"6 years, stopped going to meetings and calling my sponsor for a couple of month...
I'm still clean and have been going to back to meetings and calling my sponsor more. I want to share this because Im doing the things I am supposed to do for a reason.

During this time life was great, my finances were better than they ever have been. The relationship was great. But I continued to feel discontent, I stopped meditating and doing the basics like reading literature and put the step working guide up.

What got my ass into gear is that I realized that while all this good stuff was going on around me I was miserable, and missing it. Completely unconscious and stuck in groundhog day mode.  

This is what the disease of addiction looks like for me when I am clean. SO for people that are new, just keep doing the beasics, and when you drift away from them, and start feeling crappy about life for no reason at all. Its not become the program doesn't work. Its because we are slowly trying to get back to using.

I had thoughts of going back to punk shows, and wishing I could drink a beer. I live in Georgia, and when I found out weed got decriminalized the little addict inside of me said OH BOY!. 

Never feel like you shouldnt be thinking about drugs or drining just because you have some time. Its natrual, just get back to doing what your supposed to and you will be okay.

I talking to a new coming for 5 minutes after a meeting complete lifted a small stint of a 2-month minor spiritual depression and got my spirits soring again.

Recovery isn't hard, but the disease never goes away and the more clean time you get the easier it is to make excuses to isolate yourself. and make it feel impossible 

Hope this helps some people out!",

I am acquainted with Alcoholics Anonymous and don't have an axe to grind today. I prefer and believe in different recovery methods...5+4=9, so does 6+3. Same results different ways.  In recovery circles though, it seems that if you mention you're not in AA...suddenly..at least I've noticed, without a Big Book in my hand I'm not the most popular person in the room.😕",

"8 years ago today, I made a decision that became the the gift of desperation.
Hiya, looking back on how bad, it was . . .  Ok. Yes. It wasn't just bad. It was horrible. And, ""it"" wasn't horrible. I was horrible. I had damaged people's lives, cost companies money, disappointed family members, sullied my parent's and my surname's reputation, and made people have to have fear in their lives. Plus, no matter how I spin it, when I was making my runs to the stores to get my alcohol, I wasn't completely sober: hadn't been for months.  I know I put lives at risk.  

Luckily, I was desperate enough to do something different; I became desperate enough to listen and to stop fighting. And for that, I have been given a life I never imagined. I do not regret the past nor do I wish to shut the door on it. From that past, I stand here because I was given a gift that allowed me to take action. 

Because of our steps, the people in those rooms, the people here,  those words on those pages, and a power great than myself, I am truly grateful. What gifts we get! They are literally remarkable.

 Thank you all.",
"i fucked up real bad today.
Dealing with addiction off and on for 2 years, lately due to depression i've been getting really reckless with my usage. My professor noticed the marks on my arm and confronted me about using and i told him the truth that yeah, i'm 
dealing with addiction. (I talked about it in an earlier [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/69ngog/well_i_guess_it_had_to_come_out_some_time/?st=J2GL3I0O&sh=fd556fa8) )


I was clean for not even a full 2 days after that conversation with him but of course i wasn't going to let my addiction go that easily. I happened to try BTH last night for the first time and instantly i knew that BT was going to be a realllllll problem for me. I spent most if not all of yesterday high off my face. (not trying to brag just trying to give a feel for the state of mind i was in). 

Fast forward to today. My afternoon class was canceled and i had a good 6 hours in between classes, so i say to myself that i could get high in my car in the parking garage (yes dumb i know) , nod out and wake up when it's time for class. Load a rig, hit it, i get nice and toasty. 

I wake up to a fucking commotion. I'm on the floor of the parking garage with my professor holding me in his arms, shaking me saying my name over and over. Here's how the conversation basically went from bad to worse. 

Me: What is going on? 

Him: I pulled you out of your car, you weren't responsive. I thought you were dead. 

Me: No, i'm fine just...tired 

Him: You're not ""just tired"" you're using arent you! I thought you were going to stop. 

Me: It's fine, i'm fine. 

Him: Stop saying things are fine. You're not fine. How long are you going to keep doing this? You're so lucky I saw you in your car, what if you had OD? Stop breathing? no one would have been around. You could have died, you have a problem. 

Me: I don't need a lecture *(ass hole moment #1)* 

Him: you might not care about your life, but i do. **In my office now**. 

Me: No, i don't want to talk about this. I'm fine. 

Him: [begins to yell] In. my. office. now, i mean it. Don't make me come looking for you, or you're going to have a whole slew of new problems. 

Me: Fine. 

*Fast Forward 10-15 minutes while i actually contemplate not going to meet him and running away forever* 

Him: Glad you came. 

Me: Well i'm here. [me being an asshole moment #2]

Him: I have a lot to say so i need you to drop the attitude before things get out of hand and i end up saying something that i can't take back. okay?

Me: *nods* 

Him: Clearly, you have gone off the deep end. All self preservation has gone out of the window. i don't know what made you like this, i can only imagine, and i'm sorry these things happened to you. However, that does not give you the right to  throw your life away. You have to at least try to do better. You might not see it but you look like death half of the time. Youre unresponsive, can't keep your eyes open, they're sunken in. I've been worried about you for a long time and to see what you've become it really breaks my heart. You can't handle your life right now. 

Me: I can handle my life just fine. You wouldn't have even known I was using had you not seen my arm. I have never given you not one reason to worry about me, all my work is handed in on time, and it's well done at that. 

Him: But do you hear yourself? You're really trying to rationalize your drug addiction. 

Me: Well that's what addiction *is*. I can't be this perfect, person. I am doing the best i possibly can. This shit is not easy, and it's not fun.  

Him: I never said it was 

Me: But that's what you expect from me. Right? You think you know what's going on but you don't (asshole moment #3)

Him: What else do i need to know? You're battling and from the looks of it, you're loosing to your drug addiction. You are one of my favorite students, i consider you a bright and talented young woman and i know i'm asking a lot from you but please try. You are dying. *[he starts tearing up at this point and now im really feeling like garbage]*.  If anything happened to you, i'd be crushed and i can't watch you die. It's too hard on me. So, here's your ultimatum you and I go down to the crisis intervention center right now, you get signed up for the drug treatment program and we go from there. 

Me: And if i decline? 

Him: Then were done. I'm not going to help you kill yourself any more. I'm not saying you have to be completely clean, i just want you to atleast put in some effort. Please. If not for yourself than do it for me. 

Me: This is bullshit you know. I'm only doing this to get you off my back. 

Him: I know. Just indulge me for a little. Let me believe that you want to get sober.

So now , i'm in the receptionist office at the crisis center, waiting to see the terms of my program. Bright side is, it's free. (technically the price of the program is already included in my tuition fees). I might as well put those $$ to work. Hopefully i can beat this. ",

"What's your rock bottom story?
Hello guys. I was wondering if anyone would want to share their story of rock bottom and maybe how you turned it around if you have made it that far?

I'm 27 male who after a bad turn of events in life decided to self medicate my depression with heroin. I quit paying my car payment and lost a $21,000 brand new car I had already put nearly 9k into. I lost my job of 4 years, lost my apartment and most of my friends as well as caught a couple possession charges. After losing everything and living out of my car for months I got back in touch with my family and have reached  7 months sober now with the support of my mother and little brother. I have been living at my mother's for the past 7 months and working a pretty low pay job without much room to advance in. I guess I'm at the point where I'm sober and don't really have the desires to go screw it all up again. On the other hand I'm getting to the point where all my mistakes are really hitting home and beginning to feel a bit hopeless that I'll ever be able to make up the lost ground. I'm happy to be sober and drug free but am struggling to stay positive. Going from being 24 with a 45k salary, new car, nice apartment to almost 28 making $9.00/ hour and a barely running camry living at my mother's really makes all my past mistakes seem like unpassable mountains in my future. 

I was hoping to maybe find some people with similar stories who have continued on to a decent life despite their past of addiction. I hope you're all having a wonderful day and are staying strong in your sobriety!",
"Methadone pharmacy issues-anyone else feel judged and singled out?
I am on methadone in Ontario and am getting it from shoppers drug mart.  In order to get your methadone there, first you have to be interviewed by the pharmacist and screened as they are trying to avoid theft(since apparently people on methadone are more likely to steal). They charge more than any other pharmacy, by almost $3/day but that was worth it since they are so close to my house.  They have you sign a code of conduct saying you'll respect the neighbourhood and store etc. 

I got my drink last night and while waiting with the pager they give, I browsed around the makeup section.  I was looking to get some tweezers and there was a cosmetics employee right beside me that I was asking questions about various tweezers, then the pager went off and I went to the pharmacy right away to get my drink. 

After paying at the pharmacy I was leaving the store.  The assistant manager stops me and says""is there any makeup in your bag that you haven't paid for? Someone complained that you put merchandise in your bag'.  I immediately handed my bag to her to look through and she hands it back and says she was just following up the complaint. No apology or anything, she actually seemed disappointed she didn't catch a Theif.

I was so embarrassed I was almost in tears.  I've never stolen anything, I've always been so nice and friendly to the staff and pharmacists there. I am almost scared to back, I feel like I'm branded and they'll always think I'm stealing.  I planned to just sit in the waiting chairs the next time I'm waiting and to not browse around, but that also makes me feel bad because I was not guilty in the first place but I'm so ashamed I don't want it to happen again.... what if the next time I know some of the people in line?  I thought of calling the store manager and asking them to review the tapes to make sure my name is actually cleared. Having signed that code of conduct, I want to cooperate so I can keep getting my drink at a local pharmacy even though it costs more, but I hoped to be treated like every other customer.

I'm so upset.  I feel so judged and embarrassed.  They'd never target insulin customers this way.  

Has anyone else had experience with this? Or advice on how I should handle future visits there?",

About a week away from 2 months clean but today is a tough day.

"Thinking of a relapse?
The holidays can suck. It feels like you're supposed to be cheerful and ""merry."" You see people celebrating with alcohol. At gatherings of family and friends or the ""merriment"" at restaurants and bars. Even if alcohol isn't your drug, there's an atmosphere of celebration through intoxication. 

Many of us have painful memories of holidays with our family or bad things that happened at this distinct time of year. Or we have anxiety and stress around seeing and interacting with our families. Or we are alone and it can feel like we're the only person on earth who's alone - that's not true, it just seems that way.

Oh shit here's where I write something inspirational and encouraging about how you can make it through it. Even if it's some 12 step saying. Nah, I'll leave that up to you.

My point is last fall I relapsed and was sure it wouldn't last long but spent almost the whole next year mired in active addiction. I had abstained for a couple months. Things were going great. I wasn't doing any kind of program, just avoiding using, but my life was so much better! Getting along with my partner, actually having good sex, not wasting all my money and gladly free of the anxiety/pressure of having to think about drug, go obtain drug, use drug, worry about having enough etc. 

Then the holidays came and I probably should've focused on gratitude for my sobriety but I didn't know that and naturally felt cravings. The long weekend started. When I came home on Wednesday my ""partner in crime"" announced that we were going to ""have a good weekend."" I was upset because I liked being free from the clutches of active addiction and seeing my partner that way. I freaked out. I was promised repeatedly that it would be ""just for the holiday."" And ""just this once; I promise."" I actually didn't want to relapse but I couldn't resist the temptation or even imagine abstaining while my partner used. 

We then used daily or almost daily for the whole next year (well, for me until August 31). That weekend lasted though Christmas and New Years (I remember using on New Years), through winter, spring and summer and - for him-  fall. Can an addict use just this once or for this weekend? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe it depends on the unique combination of person/substance/circumstance. But I will tell you I was mainly afraid for my partner. I knew there was no fucking way I'd go back to that dark place after my hard work (it wasn't enough work though) to quit. I was wrong. 

If you're in that situation and tempted to just get drunk or high for the holiday, or relapse on an addictive behavior to feel excited/numb, sit through the shitty feeling until it goes away because it will, plan something healthier to do, tell someone who will help you stay sober! Even if you're pretty sure you *probably* can just this once, don't take the chance, which will simply increase your dissatisfaction in the end. It's not worth it. Give yourself the gift of hanging on to your sobriety/sanity/hope/ new life. ",
"115 days today
I honestly never thought I'd enjoy being sober, but I've been enjoying the little things. I realized today that for the first time in years there's money in my bank account from a week ago. It wasn't spent before it even hit the bank. It's the first time in over three years.

It hasn't been without it's struggles though. I've had some minor slip UPs that some may count, but personally I don't. Lately I've been missing the people more than anything. I moved towns when I got out of treatment, and haven't found any good meetings with people my age. I should probably get back into the rooms but I just haven't found the motivation. Even looking for and finding many similarities going and listening to people 2 to 3 times my age gets repetitive.

"A tragic story about addiction's effect on a family, from a local newspaper.
A recent story in a newspaper local to me tells of a [35 year old man who died of an overdose on heroin](http://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/local/2016/09/17/heroin-takes-2-lives-one-family-same-day/90350254/).  As a result, his sixty year old mother took her own life later that day.  It was her birthday.

"Did anyone else walk away from AA?
12 years sober here.  Got sober when I was 19.  Did meetings for years and then found AA was making me choose between AA folks and everyone else.  Anyone else decide to leave meetings?  Why?  And how is that working out for you?  What alternatives are you using for support? I think I've gone to 4 meetings in the last 2 years.",
"Confessions of a Drug Addict
It's 2012. I'm a 22 y/o degenerate male, living off my poor enabling grandma. I have tried to get sober many times before and always returned to drugs. At this time, I've used many drugs and I'm addicted to probably half of them. I wasn't being the man I was raised to be and I knew it. Im dissatisfied and in a moment of clarity reach out to my family to support me in going to treatment. They hesitated, it was my 7th treatment center after all, but ultimately obliged and sent me to a treatment center located about 2 hours from home. I stay for 2 months and reach a point where I really am done using drugs. It's like a switch went off and I knew, then and there, that I was done using drugs and destroying my life and it was time to make some changes.

Well, I did make changes, many of them. I ended up moving into a halfway house near the treatment center I was in (Central FL) away from anyone and everything I knew. I did everything 'right' (for anyone familiar with 12 step recovery, 'right' means going to meetings, working the steps, sponsoring, being sponsored, etc.) I got a great paying job with a fortune 100 company, I did really well in career and started getting healthier too. By all accounts, I had essentially transformed. From the unemployable recluse that no one wanted to be around to a fresh start with many friends, good health/fortune and many opportunities. After a few years of sobriety, I began to think, 'hmm, maybe this AA stuff really works.'

Well it does work and it worked for me, that is until I stopped working it. In late 2015, I was having a somewhat rough day. I had only been attending maybe one meeting a week, I had no real connection with higher power and I was really dissatisfied with many areas of my life. Even though I had a great paying job, I hated it and was not doing what I wanted to be doing which was working in the medical field. But working in medicine required going to school, and I didn't believe in myself quite enough to just sign up (even though I was in the gifted program as a child and always excelled in school prior to drug use.) But I digress, the point is, I was unhappy with my world, unable to accept everything in God's universe exactly the way it was and I was ready for relief. That day, I was standing in a gas station and noticed a little bottle that looked like a 5-hour energy but it had words on it like 'Feel Good' and 'Relieve Pain.' I don't know if any of you guys can relate, but to me those types of trigger words set off a reaction in my brain. And if I'm not actively working to recover, my brain does what an addicts brain does, it seeks to feel good and relieve pain.

I drink the bottle and later find out the active ingredient in it is kratom, which I had only ever heard about before but never experienced. I feel a warm, tingly sensation and I immediately know I'm already in over my head. This one tiny bottle begins a spiral out of control that I have experienced all too many times. I told myself all of the same things we hear, 'well, I've been sober for three years, surely I can use this legal harmless pain reliever with no issue.' One bottle a day turns into two; two into three; the beast is unleashed. 

Living with two completely different brains can be exhausting. Hearing one side say so clearly, 'you know where this will lead you, it takes you down the same path every time.' While the other side says, even more clearly, 'but just this once won't hurt. After today we'll never do it again.' For anyone that has ever experienced this phenomenon of addiction, I feel for you, deeply. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this far. It has been very cathartic getting these feelings out into the air. I feel very down on myself currently because after this aforementioned relapse, I went back to the same treatment center and sobered up. I started back in school full time and then, after 5 months sober, found myself back at the gas station, staring at the shiny little bottles. I take one and the cycle starts over again. So I'm currently back on the kratom wagon wondering why one's brain would ever want to sabotage someone in such a way. I know enough from the 12 steps to know that I am only a victim if I choose to be and that this is something I've done to myself. But I swear to you, sometimes that second, addictive brain sounds like someone else entirely. Someone that I absolutely cannot refuse, as if there was a gun being pointed to my head.",
"NA/12 steppers: where does one draw the line between medications for mental health and not being clean?
Been going to NA for 8 weeks. Very positive experience so far.

Curious why my low dose drug maintenance (Suboxone 2mg, Valium 2mg) is not seen as being clean. I don't want to use my addict brain and poke holes in this (ie it's stupid because Reasons!), but I'm genuinely confused why antidepressants are seen as fine, but not my meds. My maintenance meds keep me stable. Do I want to get off them? Hell yes. But the consequences have been dire in the past.",
"After my nine month anniversary, I decided that I was matured enough to go back to my DoC.
I was working in treatment and managing a halfway house at 20 years old, had a sponsor and been through my steps. On June 6 I threw it away.

 It was fun for a little bit, I won't lie. Now, a little over a month later, I can't stop. I spend most of my days sitting in my room contemplating suicide. I don't eat, I don't have any friends that are positive for me and I have never been so low in my entire life. The insanity is, I'm not ready to be totally sober. I'm on the verge of my 21 birthday and I want to be a normal person and be able to go out for a couple drinks once in a while. 

I guess my point in writing this is that no matter what your drug of choice is, if you're an addict and have put together some clean time and saw life from another perspective, your next relapse will be worse than ever. If someone were to slide a gun next to me I'd put it in my mouth because of all the people that once supported me now won't even look at me. This disease is REAL. I'm not looking for sympathy, hopefully someone reads this and actually listens. If you read all of this, thank you. ",

Doesn't sound like a big deal but coming from an addict like myself that is a bold move. Yes, I love the high but I dread the low.

"Does anyone else, if totally honest, still love your drug of choice?
This post is quite long, so if you think TL;DR then feel free to skip it and just post your answers to the thread title and/or your own experiences - this post is more of me ranting/venting and putting my own thoughts down rather than a preamble to the question anyway, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject regardless! 

I wish I could find some hate & vitriol in me for heroin. I wish I could despise it like all my real friends & my family do for what it's turned me into, and for the pain I've caused all of them. I wish I could totally despise it for dragging me down, for transforming me from a moral, honest, generous, caring, motivated guy with a bright future into a lying, deceiving, manipulative, selfish guy, someone who's single motivation is to score more heroin, someone without a job, who's not studying who's future seems hopeless & bleak.

I wish I could remember not only the pain it has caused those around me, but the profound physical & psychic pain it has inflicted on me - I wish the sickness was at the forefront of my mind when I'm not in active addiction, when the memory of the horrible, torturous five days of total hell would serve me as motivation to keep me off of it, but alas that memory is only as pertinent as it should be when I am using and need to score, where it motivates me to score, rather than it being a salient memory when I could use it to my advantage to stop me from using again when I've broken the habit.

I wish that the recollection of what can only be described as sociopathic behavior when I'm using was what I could remember before I use - the fact that I literally do not give a fuck who I steal from, who I hurt, who I use in order to get my fix when I'm in the grip of addiction. I wish I remembered how heroin could take me to a very lonely & dark place where the only pathetic solace could come from the company of other addicts, just as fucked up as me or moreso, the only ones who could truly sympathize with me, but if push came to shove wouldn't give me a penny were there not something in it for them.

I wish I remembered my mothers anger that turned to tears that became hysteria, something that only I and I alone have ever drove her to by taking all of the understanding that she's had to muster up, all of the help & support and love, and throwing it back in her face by continually lying to her & stealing from her with no regard to how it would effect her, as long as I wasn't getting sick. I wish I could remember the sharp & profound depression that settles over me when I've just gotten through the physical withdrawals, when my emotions come flooding back and suddenly my conscience returns with a vengeance, and the actions of the selfish drug addict that I was keep replaying constantly in my mind, and I long for the sweet opiate numbness just to give me a break from the memories of someone so driven by heroin that's I can scarcely recognize my own behavior, such is the contrast between the person who uses and the one who is clean.

But alas, this depression does not last long. Every time I quit it's always the same - after a month, give or take a week or so, my mood will bounce back to normal. In a way, this is a blessing, as I've read enough accounts on the internet to know that many suffer from much worse PAWS than I, and many do not feel normal for months & months afterwards, occasionally even a year or longer. However, as it stands, I am not one of those people. My energy levels & my mood return to normal, and with it comes an extremely welcome optimism, excitement, a lust for life that is almost foreign to me as it is entirely unrelated to drugs. This is not the ""pink cloud"" - I am not ecstatically happy or overly excitable, I am truly euthymic and feel ""normal"", which after the contrast of my happiness solely depending upon regular insertion of a needle full of heroin, followed by the agony of withdrawal and then the weeks of feeling profound depression that seems to suck all the joy out of life and leave me in a dark & joyless place, after this the contrast is like the sudden arrival of the first day of spring after a long & cold winter.

However, it is both a blessing & a curse. Suddenly, all of the reasons I have to hate heroin & hate myself when I'm on heroin fade to the back of my mind, as if someone has turned on a dimmer switch in that particular part of my mind where those memories are stored. The sickness is now a distant memory, and that raw, visceral & salient recollection is something that I can not bring to my mind. I remember it almost as if I've watched someone else go through it - I can recall simultaneously throwing up and pissing out of my ass, I can recall stomach cramps, I can recall insomnia and discomfort, but in a clinical & detached way - I can no longer remember exactly how it felt to be experiencing it, I can just remember that it happened. Now I'm telling myself that it wasn't all that bad, I'm telling myself that old chestnut ""What's five days, anyway? I must have been a pussy to have thought I couldn't handle just five days of being ill"".

Simultaneously & gradually, the insidious memory of being high is getting stronger and stronger. I believe ""euphoric recall"" is the clinical term for it, but I prefer to think of it as the devil whispering in my ear. I wish that these memories were exaggerations or were false, but alas, they are not. Images flash through my mind of the ritual of taking heroin - cutting up and folding pieces of foil to chase that shimmering, black blob back and forth to inhale the bitter fumes into my lungs, images of me pouring a small amount of brown powder into a pot, adding glittering crystals of citric acid, mixing it with water, and with a flick of the lighter watching it all combine to make that orangey-brown liquid, to be taken up into a syringe and mainlined. It is this memory that becomes the most salient - the moment of injection, that orgasmic release as all my pain, discomfort, worries, troubles, sadness & any trace of negativity is eliminated from my body, as a wave of a warmth that feels so pure, so visceral, so real, so so so GOOD that for a few moments I feel like my soul has been touched by God himself. That lovely, comfortable, fuzzy embrace that I seem to melt into as heroin wraps me in its narcotic arms and tells me that everything is alright, everything is perfect & always will be perfect. A euphoria that develops like no other type of drug - in contrast to drugs like crack or amphetamines that send your brain rocketing into euphoria so strongly that you are sure to come crashing down, it is as if my mind, freed from the troubles & worries & burdens of everyday life, is like a balloon with the string cut - free to float gently up to a pure tranquility and euphoria, gently pushed out of the realm of normal everyday moods into a mindset so optimistic and detached and carefree that in retrospect you can admit is of course unnatural, but the mindset at the time feels so, so natural and primal that it's easy to forget that things were ever different or will ever have to change. The state is so blissful & tranquil that it is like returning to the womb - a high that feels so natural and just GOOD, that every cell of my body tells me that its how I should feel all the time, creating powerful associations with every shot that heroin = heaven.

And with the high draining all of my sadness & worries, all the anxieties that come with daily life melting away like butter in a hot pan, suddenly the best side of my personality can shine. A confidence comes to me, not unnatural like the arrogance of a cocaine high, a confidence that is understated enough to be merely be like me on a very good day, except for the fact that because it is induced by the narcotic charms of heroin it is a confidence that doesn't ebb & flow with extraneous factors, but one that is entirely untouchable and unconcerned with what is actually going on around me. Throw a little caffeine into the mix to combat the drowsiness that heroin brings, and it's as if the cobwebs have been dusted off of my mind - the deep relaxation combined with the slight sharpening of the caffeine means that my mind can free associate and yet remain laser focused, a state that would be fantastic for productive work but one that is most often put to use in conversations, where I, again just like me on a good day, become very talkative. I can truly engage with the person I am talking to, I feel like I can make them feel however I want them to feel, I can bring them up and make them smile as my total optimism becomes infectious, I laugh and smile freely and I seem to become witter and make people laugh very easily, and even if a joke falls flat or the person I am talking to doesn't respond in a positive way, heroin's comforting embrace means that I remain unaffected.

At a slightly lower dose I become very sociable, energetic, confident & just happy, and I absolutely love it. At higher doses, I drift in and out of consciousness, nodding all the time, and I gaze out at the world from my deep heroin cocoon, my consciousness wrapped in warm cotton wool. I will watch a film or listen to music or just even do nothing at all and still feel blissful, chain smoking cigarettes as every drag is just as enjoyable as the first, every cigarette like an awesome little jolt of pleasure in my brain, and when I am this high, I am totally, totally untouchable. The world is perfect, I am perfect, heroin is perfect, and everything was, is, and always will be perfect. I know all this to be true and not the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, because I fucked up again today.

Heroin is completely ruining my life, and though I wish I could hate it like I should do, but no matter what it takes from me, part of me cannot help but still love it.",
"Hello All, I hope I'm here to stay.
For my story you can go through my post history. Night one of detox from alcohol, feels bad man. Can't sleep. I've made a completely new Reddit account and purged the old one. I totally customized all of my subreddits to fit my interest and draw motivation from. Glad to be here tonight, wish you all the best. &lt;3",
"I need your help, guys. I'm slipping.
Its nearly 1 AM where I am and I just need to get this out. Maybe by seeing it written down and asking for this subreddit's input I will be able to bring myself back to reality a bit :( And truthfully, I'm not even sure where to begin- or if this is the right place. Here goes.

My problem? Getting completely sh*tfaced, all the time, is starting to become a very, very attractive idea to me again. The cravings are back and they're gaining strength by the day. Its been a really rough couple of months (my marriage fell apart, I had to quit my job, trying to patch things back together, working out child custody arrangements...the list goes on) and I feel so weak to be even admitting it. 

I've already slipped up, twice. But those slips alone terrify me. The appeal in it to me, is that for even a few hours I feel like I am transformed into someone I don't hate. I'm not the scruffy, painfully shy shambling foreign weirdo with a bad stutter. I'm someone cool and glamorous and fun, who isn't a miserable wart on the faces of the pretty and not-friendless. The most insidious part of this illness is that it *insists that it is not a problem* even when YEARS of evidence to the contrary beg to differ. What makes it worse is that my ex-husband is also an addict: he's having so much fun drunk and high, while I am miserable and sober.

I don't even feel like I can call myself 'sober' anymore: I feel like I'd had a mission and I failed it. I am so disappointed in myself. I'm looking for more recovery meetings in my neck of the woods, and I am speaking to my therapist on Friday about it. The best I can do right now is physically not touch booze or anything else I fancy might take my problems away- or at least, any feelings I have about them.

Folks, please tell me, how do you cope when it just feels like its getting too strong? ",
"I [30m] sober 6 years next Dec. am depressed and the thought of drink or use just keeps edging in
They say my disease is doing push ups in the parking lot.  I've hardly been to any meetings this year .  My focus has been on career, education .  I don't think I've been to a meeting in two months before that might've been a month and a half . My first two years I think I spent a whole cumulative  two full weeks in meditation .  I hardly ever pray. I've slept with two women over the past year  both of whom were very attractive one very intelligent one super hot oh my gosh.  I've had money I've had disposable income.  Things I never had when I was using. Now though I just have been so depressed about things at work. Not having development in my career I have turned to education. It's been good it's been challenging. But without working a program I am hard on myself. I am mean to myself. I insult myself.  Everything becomes about me me me  and how I'm not getting what I want.  What I want is a purpose, the purpose that is going somewhere, I want a place in the world that says you are valued and needed and appreciated.  I don't feel valued at work I don't feel appreciated I don't feel needed .  You know I've experienced something like depression over the past five years and it hasn't been like this and it hasn't been like this because in the past I've at least attended a meeting once a week at least .  Now though I'm so cut off and so continually in my head it's feels inescapable .  My mind entertains the idea of being mean, out of holding grudges, of seeking revenge for people behaving in ways I don't agree with .  I stopped going to meetings because I couldn't relate to people. I cant relate to young people because I am coming out of my 20s, because a lot of the young people in my area are in their 20s and are experiencing very different things than I am right now.  I can't relate to older people because I've never been married, I've never honestly been in love, I've never been in a relationship longer than a year, there's a lot of living I haven't done because I chose to drink and drug in my early 20s setting me back at least at least five years from my peers.  Normal,  I have always despised normal, and yet I've always been jealous of normal.  I think I need a therapist and I need to make it to a meeting. But first I have to move out of this place which I hate my roommate is a fucking I don't wanna get into it.",
"Rehab tomorrow
I'm headed to rehab  for cocaine and alcohol tomorrow. It's 50 days long. I'm 21 yrs old. Can barely imagine sober life. I've been a drunk since I was 17 and been off and on cocaine since I was 15.

I've been to detox  once when I was 15 for ecstasy. Started blow almost immediately  after.

"5 months.
For the first time in over 17 years I've been clean and sober from any and all mood or mind altering substances for 5 months today. It took a pretty bold move on my part and the help and support of at least 50 guys. I'm around guys in recovery all day, every day, and it's kind of weird being at the point where I have guys behind me on the path looking to me for feedback on their recovery. 5 and a half months ago I was laying in bed drinking from the moment I woke up til the moment I passed out and pissed myself, all the while binge watching intervention and crying to myself about the fate I had accepted would rule my inevitably short life. I know objectively 5 months is a pocketful of ain't-shit compared to 17 years in active addiction, but it's a personal best for me and something I couldn't have imagined possible.",
"I Got 24 Hours.
This is my first ever post on Reddit. I'm still trying to learn the proper protocol and etiquette so please forgive me if I've made mistakes posting. 

I entered the rooms of a 12 Step program back in December 2012, right before Christmas. I had periods of clean time off and on until September 2013. Then, after a relapse at a Yankee Game in September 2013, I was graced with a full year clean until September 2014. 

I allowed myself to slip with alcohol bc I felt I deserved a drink after a woman I obsessed with from March 2012 finally got married. That was a reservation I never gave up on. Shortly after that I left the rooms and picked up smoking weed again in about October 2014. 

I've been using since that time. I can't remember the last day clean I had. Until today.

After hitting a spiritual bottom where I felt nothing but depression and a sense of worthlessness, I threw away my paraphernalia yesterday. I last smoked prior to 6pm on 6/11. I made a 7am meeting today, reached out to my old sponsor, and I'm happy to say I've put a full 24hrs together. 

I don't know how long it will last but I'm excited I was able to do this. I was beginning to think I'd never be able to stop using. 

Thank you for letting me share. Your experience, strength, and hope are welcomed.

"Sober over 13 years in AA. Not sure I'm an alcoholic. Need to talk about it
Throwaway for obvious reasons. This is something I need to talk about that I dont know how to openly talk about with friends (most of whom are sober) I've been an active member of aa for most of my sobriety. I go to probably 4 meetings a week, sponsor 3 guys and actively work a program.

Some back story, I got sober when I was really young, just before I was 16 (I'm 31 now, I had a 'slip' when i was 18 where I took a sip of alcohol (on purpose, not by accident) and had a sponsor who recommended I change my date). If i'm being entirely honest I was not a drinker. I probably drank alcohol a handful of times before I came into AA, and never got more than slightly tipsy. I enjoyed it but I really gravitated towards smoking pot and taking hallucinogens. I took a lot of coricidin cough medicine which was easily available and I would usually buy or steal it from the grocery store. At the worst, I was probably getting high a few times a week and took about 15-20 coricidin pills at a time (the last time I probably took close to 30 over the span of a whole day). This was my 'bottom'.  Something I need to get honest about is how I've felt like I needed to embellish my using history to feel like I earned my seat in AA. I would exaggerate how much I did, or how strongly I felt compelled to use in order to feel like I fit the criteria to take the first step My mom got sober when I was around 10 years old and she was the person who took me to my first meeting when I was 15.  From when I started going to AA back then until now I've gone to meeting consistently and never really second guessed being an alcoholic or an addict since I first started going to meetings. 

I've talked openly about this with my therapist, who is the only person besides my girlfriend (not an alcoholic) who I've been honest with about what I've been thinking.

At this point I'm not sure what to do, I honestly dont know if I'm an alcoholic/ addict. I know I definitely dont fit the bill of a 'real' alcoholic, so I'm really talking about other drugs specifically. Its been so long since I used drugs and when I did I was in highschool. I dont know what the solution is but I can't avoid this question any more. Sitting in meetings now I'm realizing more and more how I dont really have an identification with a lot of what people share about, I know they say look for the similarities and not the differences but I've definitely had to do some mental gymnastics to feel like I can honestly take the first step. I identify with a lot of the feelings and thoughts that people share, but I have friends who are non-alcoholics who identify just as easily with the same feelings and thoughts.

I dont have any animosity towards the steps or the belief in a higher power. The steps have definitely helped me and Im grateful for some of the people I've gotten to help along the way. I just cant shake the thought that I've been perpetuating a belief that I'm a hopeless drug addict and I cant control myself when in reality I don't have the best evidence to back that up.

I've also seen more than a few close friends who were definitely worse than I was, leave AA and have normal lives where they can control and enjoy their drinking.

My AA inner voice tells me this is all just a trick to get me to drink again, but given my history I'm not totally convinced of that. I know the big book also suggests to try controlled drinking if you're not sure. Thats a pretty scary proposition for someone who has spent over half their life time in AA.

Just putting all this out there because I need to talk about it. thanks for listening

Edit:

Really appreciate everyone's input. Definitely feels like a safe place to share this and it really wasnt easy to do it, so I'm thankful you guys were willing to listen and give honest input. 

I'm going to start talking to my sponsor and other people I'm close to in AA and just start being honest about what i'm thinking and about what my real situation is. Not going to do the 'walk over to the nearest bar' test yet, I think that being sober for as long as I have and out of respect for the guys I sponsor I definitely need to be careful about what I do.",
"Lost another one to alcohol this weekend.
A young woman who was in my group in treatment in January died from an alcohol OD this last weekend. She was 23 and beautiful, super smart, artistic, funny and had been struggling with her demons. They won. I too have struggled with relapse on and off for 10 years. I have been clean since 12/7/13 and I'm devastated. This is the second young woman from my small group to die. This dis-ease makes me so sad and angry. I am grateful today for my sobriety and the support I get from my family and friends in the program and all of you sharing your stories. RIP my sweet friend. Peace. ",
"Today a friend sat me down.
Today, a friend sat me down because he was concerned for my well being. He asked me how many vyvanse I had taken in the last three days. I told him I had taken ten. The feeling I got when I saw his face hurt me. I knew in that moment that I have a problem. I am a stimulant addict. I have regularly abused my vyvanse for the last six months. I would take between 120-180 mg before going out and binge drinking with friends. I have agreed to go to a counselor and enter a NA program. I have contacted other friends, and my girlfriend and told them, next will be to contact my family. From today on, I WILL live a sober life. I know if I don't, I will die. Sooner or later.

Checked my phone when I got home and found out that a friend's teenage son was shot and killed on a drug corner. I'm in tears as I type this. I can't help thinking about the unimaginable grief my friend is experiencing right now. On fucking father's day of all days.

I also can't help thinking about how many times I cavalierly visited those same drug corners. How many times did I put myself in a situation where I could have done the same thing to my father?

I haven't always been a good son, but I can't express in words how grateful I am to be alive, so I can be a good son today.

"Day 3 of heroin/opiate withdrawal, dealer owes me $100. Trying to get through this...
I have no money and no job but thankfully a vehicle that's been paid off and a place to live rent free (for now). I'm currently home alone and feeling pretty shitty. Been using loperamide to abate the serious WD's but I can only imagine what they are doing to my guts because in order to get any relief I have to take at least 40mg (20 pills). Yesterday I took 50mg and the day before that I took ~55mg. It helps, but my dealer owes me $100 right now and he could call anytime. I know I should just let it go but the only other person in my life that knows about this is my Fiancé who stays gone for most of the day so I'm left to my own devices. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning but I have never used a needle before, I just crush it up and snort it, and that's been my way of life for a little over a year now. Sold off all of my valuables except for my ride etc etc. I feel like I'm hitting rock bottom but I could go lower yet and I really, really don't want it to come to that. Not sure what I'm looking to get out of posting this I guess I just feel the need to put it ""out there"". Thanks for anyone listening, I will be around today but my phone is pretty slow and it's the only connection I have to the web right now. But if anyone has any questions or just feels like saying anything I should be here to read/respond to them. Thank you for listening.


EDIT: Day 4, still clean. Thanks to everyone for the words of encouragement, some of your comments have helped immensely. I know that I HAVE to get through this. Right now I'm feeling resolute, I hope that feeling sticks. Still no word from the dealer on my $100. Pretty sure I'll never see it unless I go looking for him, and even then there's no way I'm getting it back in cash. That sucks but oh well I guess. It wouldn't be so bad if that wasn't literally the only money I had. Searched for an NA meeting nearby. Will keep updating for anyone that is still listening. Thanks again. 




EDIT 2: I've decided to let the $100 go. Deleting my dealers number right now. Something about the tired look in my fiancées eyes before she left for work today. She's weary of this and just wants it to go away so we can get on with our lives. I can tell she's running out of hope that I'll ever get better. I love her so much. A decision must be made once and for all to say, FUCK OPIATES. Fuck that shit so hard. I'm not EVER looking back.



EDIT 3: hot/cold flashes. Restless legs, and restless.. hands? Like my forearms and hands have restless leg syndrome? Skin feels hot and brittle. I hope I can get some sleep tonight. Fuck opiates.

"AA Advice needed
Had to reset my badge today. I don't get why I keep doing this to myself... I know that I know better. I'm not dumb. But I sure as fuck can act like I am.
I'll be hitting up a meeting tonight. I've only been to about 7 of them. The people are really great but I am having a hard time consolidating my beliefs (agnostic) into the 'higher power' concept, as well as with the heavy religious connotations. One meeting I go to even ends with The Lords Prayer... which baffles me. Why on earth anyone would say it's not a religious institution at that point? Even the chapter ""We Agnostics"" in the AA book didn't even come close to winning me over... although I wish it did.
Nonetheless, I am trying to keep an open mind but I can't help but feel like I'm faking it. Advice?",

"Amazing thing happened last night! Thank you to my HP, I just have to share this, because I don't want to tell on my gf in a meeting.
So my girlfriend and I met in recovery back in August, and I have seven months and she's coming up on six months.  I know relationships aren't the best thing in recovery, but this relationship does help me, on the days that I can't find the strength to help myself.  We have not ever let the relationship get in the way of our recovery yet.  But anyways, for the last couple of weeks my gf, told her parents about the things she stole from them, and the things she had to do to get one more.  She has been in a rut since then.  What I've gathered is, her disease saw a moment of vulnerability and a lack of being spiritually centered, and capitalized on it and last night she couldn't take it anymore.  She came over my house and just started bawling and saying how she just wants to use and she doesn't care about anything.  Well this is where the acceptance of my powerlessness comes in.  There is nothing I can do or say to prevent her from using.  She then felt she was bringing me down the entire time, and said she just wanted to isolate at home, and so I let her go home.  Well she didn't go home, she went and picked up three bags and then went home without my knowing.  She called me told me to go on Skype, and showed me the three bags, and my heart sank.  In the beginning of our relationship we made an agreement that if any of us use, we end the relationship regardless of the situation.  All I could think of was I may never see her again.  I didn't know what to say, because of my powerlessness.  And I looked at her through the screen obviously, and I just said, ""I love you so much, just realize that nothing will get better from doing this."" she stopped and the was silence for two minutes, but the silence was blaring.  That moment felt like two hours.  She looked back at me, and started crying again, and then she said, ""Love is the most powerful thing in the world, and I see that now.  You have never stopped loving me no matter what, and I don't want to live without you.  Tomorrow I'm going to bring this back to the person."". And so this morning, I picked her up and we brought it back.  And she's in such a good mood and we got through it, just for today.  And everything is getting better.  

I know this sounds like a stupid love story, but I just had to share the hope.  So long as you're alive you can recover.  As long as you don't use its a good fucking day.  Thank you to my higher power.  I love you all thanks for listening.",
"""You're going to be ok.""
In the beginning, I hated when someone said that ""I would be fine"" or ""It'll get better."" Or worst of all, ""Time takes time."" In the beginning, I wanted to feel better, like, NOW. But here I am, 9 months and 1 day later telling you that it will get better.

I am an alcoholic and drug addict. My love affair with substances began many years ago when I used sporadically. I sustained a back injury in 2004 and took pain medication when I needed it. When I ran out, no big deal. I stopped. I finished nursing school in July 2010 and had my first child in September 2010. The truth was, at that point in my life, I did not know how to cope with my life. I had a baby that I was terrified of ""messing up"" and I was started a high-stress job: being a new graduate nurse. This was the point where my life started to seem slightly impossible. My back pain was worse after delivering my child, so my doctor put me back on medication (Norco 10/325). I used this medication daily. I became dependent upon it. This medication made me feel how I ""thought"" I should feel: happy, full of energy. It made everything better. It made me a better nurse! At some point, I started pocketing patient's pain meds. Hell, if they weren't going to take them, I might as well. (INSANITY). On November 30, 2011, my world came crashing down around me. I was caught stealing narcotics from the hospital I worked at.  What shame and guilt I felt at this time. Shame and guilt that kept sick for another year and a half.  I had the opportunity through the board of nursing in my state to keep my license if I entered the recovery program they have for ""impaired nurses"". At this point, all I cared about was my job and my license, but not enough where I would actually work to stay clean and sober. I started to also abuse my anxiety medication (Xanax) at the same time.  All I wanted to do was sleep; to be unconscious and not deal with the mess I had caused. I was so ashamed. I did not want to tell anyone and I did not reach out for help. Little did I know that I was the last person to know how truly sick I was.  I had to tell my doctor what was going on with me, because he was prescribing me the medications. After I couldn't get pills anymore, I turned to alcohol. Something, anything to change the way that I felt. Eventually my nursing license was suspended because I was not compliant with the recovery program (I kept using), so they kicked me out of that program and suspended my license for two years beginning in May 2012. I am one of those alcoholics/addicts that has to have everything stripped away before they get a clue. After simply existing for almost a year, I decided that I would try and get my license back. That license was the only thing that mattered to me for a long time. To get it reinstated, I had list of things I had to complete (chemical dependency evaluations, continuing education credits, 3 meetings per week, random drug testing that I had to pay out of pocket for, etc.) I needed my license back. My license and job provided a false sense of security for me.  If I couldn't be a nurse, then who was I? All through my life I had identified myself with the job I had at the time. I thought that I would be ok if I could just have that back. My last use was February 28, 2013. In May 2013 I had abstained from alcohol and drugs of two and a half months. I was not working a 12-step program. I was simply not drinking or using. On the way home from a meeting I got pulled over and arrested for not going to court for a traffic ticket. A TRAFFIC TICKET. All I had to do was show up at court and pay a fine. But no. That was too hard for me. So I went to jail crying my eyes out. I spent the night in a holding cell feeling sorry for myself. I had stopped the drugs and alcohol! Why wasn't my life improving? My thoughts went from ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I am going to get drunk/high when I get out of jail,"" to ""My life is so unmanageable.""  That's the point where it clicked for me. Alcohol and drugs were merely a symptom (a big, fat symptom). I was the real problem. I am grateful for that day. That's the moment I started to actually get honest for once. That's the moment of absolute desperation. I was so desperate for my life to be different that I would try anything. Three days after being released from jail I started getting active in a 12-step program. I got a sponsor. And life has been different ever since. Or, rather, I have been different ever since.

The first gift that I was given in recovery was HOPE. At the beginning of recovery I felt so useless, scared and hopeless. To feel hope for the first time was such an indescribable feeling. Life just doesn't seem as impossible today. In sobriety I have made it through deaths in my family, losing jobs, ending a relationship. Its worth it. Wherever you are at, know that there is a different way to live and you do not have to walk this journey alone. However you chose to recover, there are always people willing to help. Keep pressing forward.",
"Creeping up on 10 years clean
This is my first time posting here, I hope to stay a while and meet some new peeps.

I am coming up on 10 years clean, and I am basically miserable. I have everything I always dreamed about when I was getting high, and non of it feels like it used to. I know that it is me, that my outlook has changed, that I am not as grateful as I once was. 

I recently lost my mom and have been in a tailspin of sorts ever since. I haven't wanted to use in a very long time, and losing her didn't change that. What it did change is my desire to better myself. Ok, that's a lie, I stopped caring about myself a long time ago. 

I have the knowledge I need to get back on the beam, just not the fire I used to have. I was hungry to learn about myself, to help others, to be a better person. I used to read 3 different spiritual books every single morning. I would follow that with a 15-30 minute deep meditation period in which I would reflect on my innermost thoughts and desires. That clarity of mind and acceptance of self is priceless.

I haven't had that in like 6-7 years. I can pinpoint the events that triggered it too. Anyways, sorry for the wall of text, but I guess I am just reaching out for something, anything, that will help me reel myself back in.

I have a bit of a different spiritual program than most of my fellows. I have practiced Buddhism for about 5 years now, and am a true atheist.

When I use these words, I am not referring to anything other than my heart, the spiritual actions, and the community.

So I'm at the point in AA where I've finished the steps and I'm supposed to go out and find someone to sponsor. I really do want to give back some of the good shit I've received through AA. The problem with this is I don't really hang out with the people from my meetings, and I don't share in the meetings unless I'm asked to lead the meeting. It seems like in order to find a sponsee I'm gonna have to both share and hang out after the meeting to talk to the newcomers, but I totally don't want to. I mean I didn't want to do a lot of the stuff I had to do in the steps and eventually I was glad that I did, and I'm not opposed to sponsoring someone at all, it's just that to find someone to sponsor is gonna take some serious prospecting and it all sounds like such a chore. When my sponsor told me to start working with other alcoholics and find a sponsee, I found this subreddit and /r/stopdrinking and that's pretty much been my social interaction part of the program ever since.

Behind every addict is a story, my story began when I was in first grade. Not useing though. I was that quite kid that didn't have but one friend. I was the kid you saw that did not have any confidence. When I got home I could be myself. I could talk freely. I could run around and be a kid.

Now lets skip to when I took my first drug.

I was 14 I smoked for the first time. I instantly because more comfortable in my own skin. I talked to people I made more friends. Friends who used. I kept on this path until 17 when I tried my second drug. I popped the pills and just lost it. Any and all feeling melted I was numb. I was happy. I was complete. 18 I tired multiple more. Acid Shrooms DMT PCP Bathsalts. Anything and everything that could make me become.... For lack of a better word trippy. People loved that me. I loved that me. But at 19 several things happened and now I'm in NA.

In NA I've been learning to cope with myself become comfortable in my skin. Be able to share and talk. Talk to strangers give them a call. Share until I cry.

"A friend of mine in recovery took his own life yesterday, I just found out. This disease sucks.
I was at my home group AA meeting tonight, and it was shared that a friend of mine, who was a former sponsee and fellow home group member, took his own life by overdose yesterday.  He was with friends over the weekend, went home to his wife, saw her off to work yesterday morning, called in sick himself, and deliberately swallowed a fatal amount of pills.  He told nobody of his despair, or of his plans.  He just did it.

This disease sucks.  It waits until we are at our weakest; it is patient and it is insidious.  It doesn't matter if we have days, months, years, or decades free from a drink or a drug.  If we allow this disease to do it's work on our minds and our spirit, it will take us out.

I've only recently made the first step, admitting to my family and friends that I am an addict and that I am powerless over the addictions that have made my life unmanageable. 

I want sobriety. I was true happiness, not an induced illusion of happiness. 

Finding this subreddit has definitely made my path look brighter, knowing there is this community to come to. 

I've read stories and posts in the past 24 hours and I feel ready to take on this lifelong goal, not exactly confident, but ready. 

One day at a time. 

EDIT: I'm on vacation in Vegas, but I'm going to a meeting today with my dad (a recovering alcoholic, sober for 10+ years). Thank you for the advice and well wishes. ",
"For those of us in recovery, it is easy to forget that this disease that we have is very deadly.
I have been sober for almost a year and a half now, and the living hell of those previous years has become all but a distant memory. I'm not super active in the program, but I try to make one or two meetings a week to at least keep in touch with my friends that I got sober with.

Tonight I was given a harsh reminder of just how deadly serious this disease is. My sister's ex-husband, and father of her two young children, was found dead today of an apparent overdose. He was supposed to have been clean for the past two years, but whether he was lying the whole time, or had been clean and had a fatal relapse doesn't really matter. My two nephews now have to grow up without a father.

One thing that kept going through my mind after learning the news was the part of the Big Book that likens us to survivors of a sinking ship. Once we get back into the daily routine of regular life, it is easy for us to forget just how lucky/blessed/fortunate we are to have survived. Not everyone survives this disease. And unless we remain vigilant and in fit spiritual condition, there are no guarantees that we will either.",
"Atheists in recovery.. how do you deal with the higher power concept, and turning your will over? 
I'm interested as to some of your thoughts... I constantly tell myself that for me a higher power is the simple fact that there is a purpose today besides getting high or drunk. Not living my will means not using, but instead being of service and talking recovery with someone every day ( I consider posting here that). 

I want to believe, I really do. I just don't, and I feel like 'faking it til i make it' is really dishonest. I used my disbelief as an excuse that there was no purpose besides feeling good for a long time. Today I put my 'faith' in the belief that feeling good in recovery is MUCH better than feeling good using. 

Sometime I feel like dismissing the program because it's so heavy on the God concept, but I do believe that it can work for me, so that's why I am giving it an honest effort this time around.

Thoughts?

Thank g.o.d. for one more day.

edit: I will say, out of respect for the fellowship, and habit ( I was raised catholic) I do often find myself saying the serenity and lord's prayers. I don't mind that aspect of the fellowship.",
"Would rather be with Redditors than deal with small town hypocrites
I live in a really, really small town. There is no anonymity at meetings here, just a vector for the rumor mill. So I don't go. Here, on the internets, I can be anonymous. Don't know why or how I didn't think of this sooner.",

I heard a great explanation in a meeting yesterday.  It came from someone had many years of continuous sobriety.

She was asked why, since she had been sober so long, did she still go to AA meetings.

She said that she had made up her mind not to drink, but that she went to meetings so that her mind STAYED MADE UP.",
"9th day sober
This is day 9 of sobriety for me. I kicked my dope habit after over a month of everyday injection, 3-4 times a day. I have spent over 3,000$ on nasty black tar heroin since september. I moved back home after my internship was over, because i got kicked out of my uncles house. That was in denver, now im in San Antonio.

I confessed about addiction to my father. Now, and told him i have to get clean, i have too. he has me on lock down at the house, I cant go anywhere without him or my brother there. I am on naltrexone, and some weird anti psycotic sedative i take before bedtime. I have to take this because ssri do not work for me, probably because i inherited type 2 BPD from my mother.

There is no money for rehab, and at the first chance i would go out and score some oxymorphone, maybe even heroin but i tell myself no.

I am taking it one day at a time at this point. My schedule is like: Wake up, take naltrexone, think about smoking weed or shooting up(while working for my dad), go to gym, think about smoking weed and shooting up, go to sleep. 

I just want to know if I can ever recover to a state, perhaps in 30 days, where i can smoke a bowl and not start using drugs everyday again. Will I ever be able to not want to do oxymorphone again? Can i ever use oxymorphone again? I used it for a year without breaking into an everyday or everyweek habit. (also there is a limtied supply of those).",
"Celebrated 1 month today!
So it's my first time walking through the steps. I met my sponsor in detox. She shared her story and I sobbed, knowing I had to be done or else my disease would kill me. 30 days later and I picked up my chip from my homegroup! I'm headed to Boston for my Cousin's HS Graduation and I was wondering if anyone had tips for a baby in the program who's going on vacation. I have a feeling it'll be a lot harder than dealing with home. Also don't forget to pray for the man who is still suffering out there. :) <3",

Was drinking way too much; asked my doctor for some help.  Was prescribed Disulfuram (antabuse) and Lorazepam (Valium like Benzo) for the anxiety that will come in the afternoons with the cravings for alcohol.

If I drink tonight, I'd become severely ill.

My last drink was Wednesday evening.",

"25 of 42 years drinking.  A commitment to go straight Monday.  What can I expect?
I'm 42.  I've spent the last 25 years drinking till drunk pretty much every night.  I've had maybe 15-20 drink-free days in that time.  5 of those days was a course I went on.  Another 10 would be the ""one or two days a week I don't drink"" effort I managed for a few months in 2005.

I've been going to AA meetings once a week for the last 2 months and seeing a Drug & Alc counselor during that time.  Quite challenging sometimes.  During that time certain truths have hit home. I can't deny it.

I'm fortunate.  Right now I don't need to work.  There will never be a better time for me to quit.  No stress, apart from waking uo and wondering when I'll have a drink.  Then getting the shits that this us my first thought of the day.

So, Saturday night I'll have my last drink.  Sunday night straight.  Then Monday I turn up at a local govt. sponsored (UK) support group where you sign up for 2 weeks clean - they have a program covering 9:30am till 2pm.

On one hand I am so fucking sick of being a drunk (what did I have for dinner last night? I don't remember.)  Yes, I am soooo ready.  The stories I hear at AA seem to say it's worth it.

But I am so terrified.  What am I going to do with an extra 6 hours in my day?  Will Reddit be boring?  Will life be boring?  Will the games I play be boring?

From what I've seen, longer term AA ppl (say 1yr+) seem to be happy.  Over the hump maybe.

In recent meetings I've only seen one or two newcomers talk and say ""It's hard"".

I'm going to be there soon.  Please share.  Thanks.",
"9 months clean and I dont want to be alive
I am struggling so hard. I dont know whats wrong anymore. I have 9 months clean off heroin and benzos and pretty much every drug. My depression is so high. My fear is so high. My anxiety. 

I'm 24 I work a job that I hate and I have so self-esteem or confidence. I'm convinced i'm going to die alone. Never had sex, only had one relationship while I was using. Everytime anyone talks about sex or having a girlfriend to do thimgs with I feel like a loser. I feel less than. I always feel less than. Always inferior. I pray and try to keep faith that god has a plan for me but I cant even talk to a woman i fimd attractive without feeling nervous. Cant even smile at people. I've lost 60 pounds and built muscle but it never feels like its enough. I still feel fat and ugly. 

I cant take the depression anymore. All i think about it is getting dope and O.D.ing. i never feel like Ill be able to love myself. Im so tired of fighting. I dont want to be alone or be a virgin my whole fucking life. But this is the way ive always felt even before the drugs. It scares me and I am in so much pain.

I talk to my sponsor amd reach out but the feelings are always there and its embarassing and I know people get tired of me. It's taking every ounce of strength to not just say fuck it and use. 

I am in so much pain I just want it to stop. I just want to feel ok alone. I dont want to feel empty anymore. Thanks for letting me rant.",
"I am not happy
I hate this right now. I'm early in my recovery with only 9 days Clea. And sober. I was aiming for 30 by today but that didn't happen. 

It's my birthday. Had to be at work early morning so I've been up since 3am(it's 8:54) and I have been wiped all day. Went to an NA meeting for a 3 year medallion but I couldn't stay for the entire meeting. 

On my way home, my friends kept asking me to come out. Knowing full well that I was at a meeting. I would like to join them...but...well people places and things...right?

I just want to be alone and not have to talk to anyone. 

Just for today my thoughts will be on my recovery, living and enjoying lifewithout the use of drugs.",

"Staying motivated in life without drugs
This is something I'm having lots of trouble with. I'm on my longest streak of sobriety in a long time, about three months without cocaine, xanax, or alcohol and honestly I can't find any meaning in life without at least one of those. I'm depressed, terrified of social interaction, always in my head, withdrawn. I've tried all the usual things- working out, getting out of the house more, spending more time with family, but as sad as I am to say it none of that fills the void that substances do. I think about using something multiple times a day. I just turned 20 and I feel like life has nothing to offer me and vice versa. Those of you that have had nothing to live for without drugs/alcohol then hot sober, how did you find any sort of happiness or will to go on in life?",
"You know whats funnier than 24 days of sobriety? 25.
Lucky post number three. I have been in recovery for the past 25 days. I exemplified the uttermost willpower, discipline, and strength..for only those 25 days.

 Tonight I've succumbed to the addiction just like old times. I relapsed. I'm surprised it took this long. All the coping methods for cravings, depressed/manic thoughts, and triggers have gone out the window. Or maybe they're barley hanging on by a string. Close enough to pull them back in. Is all lost? Was I meant to relapse? Am I cut out for a life of sobriety forever?

From what it looks like, not yet. I guess thats okay. It is what it is. I can't take it back. All I can do is start over and not repeat the same mistakes. Try, try again. I think the new diagnosis I got today of PTSD made the pot boil. I started to put together experiences that would of contributed to that conclusion. It was a lot more than I thought. A volcano of trauma erupted in my brain and burned it to ashes. I had to get away. Yeet, miss we with that bullshit. 

Had a bottle of some Bacardi premixed drink sitting at home ,had some hefty mouthfuls. Alright that was that. Whats next? Tried to cop some oxycontin, wasn't available. Hello cannabis. I forgot how amazing it felt to be high. It felt like home. Got a vyvanse and it kicked in about an hour ago. We're just getting started now. Only a matter of time before initial use transforms into out of control use. Can I stop it before I completely lose myself again? Do I even want to? How do you bounce back from this? 

I want to continue to use. Cannabis, alcohol, and vyvanse. No more oxycontin. I want to believe I can use in moderation. A functioning addict. I want to live my life and do what I want. Does anyone else feel the same? I have the right to use...",
"Few weeks late but got 1 year.
On June 7th, 2017 I was depressed, anxious, and angry. I lost all hope in ever having a normal life and didn't want to go on. I thought help was beyond me and decided to OD on purpose because I didn't think my life was worth saving. I woke up two days later in a detox and had a ""white light"" moment, if I can't go out on my terms then it's not my life. It belongs to some purpose that I can't fathom. So I accepted help.

A year later, and some days, I am a completely different person thanks to working a 12-step program. I can see things clearly and don't try and control things. Well I'm human so it's progress and not perfection. Yet when I apply what I've been given and just keep doing good then I know I'm doing what my HP wants of me. To be of maximum service to the people around me.

For anyone struggling I can assure you that if you just keep working at it then miracles happen right in front of you. Don't assume anything and don't try and figure it out. Just humble yourself and remain teachable.

TL;DR - keep trudging and good things will come. You're loved and am here for anyone struggling.",
"Has anyone taken anxiety medication in recovery?
I have been sober for 3 1/2 months now and I've experienced increasing anxiety (and panic attacks) the entire time. I had a few really bad panic attacks somewhat recently, one was bad enough to require going to the hospital because my hands were stuck in fists (doctor said it was from hyperventilating). 

My doctor referred me to a psychiatrist and he prescribed klonopin (.5mg once daily as needed). I've taken it twice and it helps a lot, I have no desire to abuse it and I did not feel high or like my mental state was altered (other than feeling better and able to get on with my day). But I'm still really hesitant to use it and I'm paranoid about getting addicted and possibly ending up back on harder drugs. 

Has anyone taken this or a similar medication in recovery and been ok?",
"What do you do when the initial “pink cloud” goes away?
Whats up guys!! Hope everyone is doing well. Wanted to get some opinions on what YOU do when you hit a wall in your recovery? (If you experience this) I often times “hit a wall” and I think it’s important to be conscious of this happening and be able to get hyped back up about recovery. Thoughts?

My problem chemicals are stimulants... meth, crack/cocaine etc. but I still smoke pot, drink wine occasionally, and plan to indulge in the occasional thereputic LSD/mushroom trip. 

A few of my friends are in AA and are staying away from their problem chemicals, but the program makes you feel like it’s for nothing if you smoke pot even though that wasn’t what put you there. I feel like my recovery is legit even though I’m continuing with pot, and occasional wine, LSD when the time is right.. Wondering what other ppl think about this? Thanks ",

"Addiction is serious but unconventional. Don't know where to begin.
I hope it's ok for me to post here, because my addiction isn't a chemical one, but I have an honest\-to\-god addiction to noise, screens, internet, and tv, and it's causing real damage to my life. I don't mean to insult anyone whose going through a drug, alcohol, or otherwise chemical addiction... but I need help :\(

I started becoming obsessed with television, youtube, and podcasts a few years back and I'm at the point where I start panicking if I'm not listening to something because hearing my own thoughts is much more painful than numbing myself with noise and visuals. It all started when I burnt out of my greatest passion and what I hoped to be my future, graphic design school, and feeling aimless in life I decided to spend my time distracting myself instead of facing my problems.

While I'm  not a biologist or a doctor, I'm terrified that I've damaged my brain at this point, because I can't read or concentrate like I used to... It's so bad, if I have to read more than 4 or 5 sentences my brain just starts skipping sentences, because it's so used to the constant barrage of sounds and noises and visuals and numbing sensations. When I graduated high school I used to read practically a book a week. I tried to read a short story the other day and struggled to get past one paragraph. I'll do dangerous, stupid stuff while driving, like mess with my phone to find podcast after podcast, because the idea of concentrating on the road for even a minute or two is too much to handle. It's a miracle I haven't gotten in an accident. My head constantly feels like it's in a cloud

I've tried to quit, to incorporate meditation into my day, to wean off of podcasts, to get off of the internet, to unplug, to not feel like I need to spend every minute of every day with distractions, but I've never been successful. I know it might sound silly to some but it's honestly overtaking my life and I'm very depressed.

Where do I even begin?",

"Day 14
Hi all. 36/m from Tacoma here. (I also posted this to /r/stoodrinking. Feel free to delete if against rules.) As I drift off to sleep tonight I will have completed a full week without alcohol and two full weeks without the drugs that haven caused me so many problems.

Last night I was really challenged. My partner Anna has built up a lot of resentment about my drug use and it all came spilling out last night when I was most vulnerable. It began with a shirt she couldn't  find and escalated from there. Multiple grievances got brought up and I was made to answer for shit I did when I was using and she was being kind of rude. It makes me so overwhelemed. My go-to in that situation normally would be to walk a mile to the pub and have a bunch of alcohol to numb myself. Last night I walked to the same pub and had a sandwich and a Mexican Coca Cola and I eventually walked back home. 

It's pretty hard shit -- dealing with the resentment. It sometimes seems like she doesn't want me to be sober. Why else would she corner me and start raging at me when I'm a week sober and practically lack any healthy coping strategies?

No... I'm making her sound like kind of a bitch but she's not. She has been incredibly gracious and patient and is only human like all of us. I'm just venting.

Anyway, I'm excited to be sober. I've had good periods of clean time from drugs but this is longest I've been without a drink in ages, and I won't be drinking again in quite a while, if ever.

Whatever happens, with my job (I'm on unpaid administrative leave and probably about to get fired) or with Anna (will she love sober me? Have I already damaged things too much?) I am going to learn a lot. 

I'm not drinking. I'm not using drugs. I'm not suicidal. That's pretty good news.

Anyway, I just left a SMART meeting and my first IOP class is tomorrow. Be well, everyone.",
"[x/post from r/addiction] Is it possible to stay sober/clean without AA/NA? My psychiatrist doesn't think so
Really dislike AA/NA. What I dislike about it doesn't matter as much at this point, but my reasons are petty, really, and probably one of my character defetcts - I hate preachy people and I hate people who complain about stupid shit. 

Anyway, is this really the only way for a life of sobriety to take place?

If so, I'll do it, I'll go more than my current twice a week. But I'll currently use or buy drugs before or after a meeting, never being high in the meeting itself, so not sure I'm working it correctly if I'm still doing those things so close to a meeting. 

I can stay clean 3-4 months on my own at a clip (making rehab somewhat useless imo), but then i get the usual, eh, I'm fine let me take a Xanax or 20 and you know the rest, a week or two later I'm coming out of a hazy coke binge. I'm on Suboxone, otherwise it'd be a heroin binge ( thank you Suboxone).

Other than an overdose, yes I almost died and that didn't stop me, consequences have been relatively light. Came damn near close to losing my 150k+ a year job, something I value dearly and succeed at when clean, but fail miserably at when high. Reading emails I sent high makes me cringe, ouch. And now that I'm in a position of relative authority makes it even more cringey, my poor subordinates :(. O, and my fiance who I love and she loves me dearly is just distraught over the whole thing, has affected our relationship to say the least, which I value zero when I'm high and 100% when I'm clean, sending terrible signals to her. 

What do I do all?

Edit: I know I'm poweless over drugs and alcohol, that's easy to admit.",

"My story with Alcohol and Crack Cocaine.
Hey, tonight I am sitting up watching Netflix and I am just having extremely lucid thoughts about the addictions that have ran the last 10 years of my life. I am going to share my story here tonight because I do not have Microsoft word on my computer and I really want to write this down somewhere it can be saved, and read by other people who are suffering. 

I first got drunk in the camper my parents parked in our drive way   when we weren't camping in it. I had just turned 13, and me an three freinds had walked downtown to Arby's and ordered some food. An older kid who worked at arby's knew one of my freinds and long story short he ended up buying us 10 shooter bottles of Crown Royal. We walked back to my camper, waited until my parents where asleep and started in on them. I drank the first one, nothing happened, So I drank 5 more in rapid succesion. Keep in mind I am a 95 pound skinny male. Within minutes I am standing up and barley moving, my two freinds are holding me and carry me outside. That night we walked all over town, I cried and screamed and acted like a lunatic and almost got us attacked by some older men in a park. The next day I woke up in the bathtub of my home at 10 am with vomit in my hair and a big cut on my arm. I had absolutely no recollection of what occurred.

Thus began a pattern of weekend drinking with my freinds, my parents being naive would supply me with boose, this was rural Alberta so heavy drinking was pretty socially accepted. I want to say I would black out close to every weekend from 13 until 18 years old. Keep in mind my parents are buying me a Case of beer friday night and another case Saturday night if I asked. 

I had very good grades and graduated with honors, but I was already an out of control alcoholic. I would get in fights, break peoples things, and create absolute havoc when I drank.

Enter University, ROCK ON! Here my pattern of binge drinking was free to bloom, with my schedule I could afford to drink almost every night. I began drinking 4-5 nights a week. Usually always beer. Sometimes up to 18 in an evening, I was vomiting nightly and I now have ruined teeth from sleeping with vomit in my mouth and a very bad heartburn issue. 
 
Enter Cocaine. 18 years old I buy a gram of cocaine with a girl at a bar, not expecting much we went back to my room to snort it. I loved it. From now on it is 6-7 beers followed by 1 gram of cocaine, 3-4 times a week. I could afford this because my parents are loaded and very naive. I also had extremely high paying jobs every summer. Cocaine cocaine cocaine, I loved it.

After two years of this, I had to drop out of university because I was not passing any courses. Partying had become a full time job and I was getting into dangerous situations. I would walk downtown early in the morning (4-5am) after all my freinds had gone to bed and solicit prostitutes and street people, trying to find cocaine and people to party with. every morning I would wake up and want to kill myself and swear I would never do it again. Maybe i would not drink for 2-3 days after a particularly wild night, but a few days later I would be recovered enough and back at it full blast.

Physical change in location will solve everything! I move to British Columbia and start a two year forestry course. By now my drinking had become essentialy daily, and I would be comfortable starting around 10 or 11. MY first semester of school I got arrested for assault. I got in a fist fight, this was very common for me while I was drunk. One of my conditions was ""no alcohol"". Being extremely scared, and my parents were starting to catch on, I managed to not drink for 3 months. Upon going to Court to have my traveling conditions changed, the clerk accidentally removed my ""no alcohol"" condition. No joke, through a typing error and lack of attention on her part, that condition was no longer on my official file. I was free to drink again. Drinking commenced immediately and furiously, and my intake of cocaine resumed along with my drinking. Now up until this point, Cocaine always followed drinking, never the reverse. However I began to use cocaine everychance I got, whenever I got it. The stress from the charges on top of the increasing watch & concern of my parents, pressures to do good in school began to stress me out and alcohol was my only way of coping with stress.

Miraculously I passed my first year (everything was very easy at this college and I am actually pretty academically inclined, even when drunk and doing coke in the bathrooms before a test). I went back to my high paying summer job and 1 month into work I got a DUI on the highway, black out drunk ripping around on my dirt bike with no helmet on the highway. I drank and drove almost daily during the last 3 years, im so glad I never killed anyone.  I lose my job, and my licence, and have to move in with my parents for the rest of the summer. This Summer i went to a 21 day treatment center on the advice of my lawyer. I learned nothing and squandered the experience and resumed drinking immediatly upon release. School started agaiin and my drinking and cocaine use continued. I went to court and was sentenced to 3 months in jail and 2 years probation. The judge allowed me to split the time in jail in two, serving two weeks over christmas break and the rest come summer, in order for me to be able to finish school. 

Christmas comes, I remember the night before I rode the greyhound to kamloops to go to the prison, I was drunk and snorting cocaine alone in my bathroom as usual, scared out of my mind. I get to prison and I am a shaking mess, I spend 9 days on the yard (in Canada you only serve 2/3rds of your time if you are well behaved) with 40 other scary fucking dudes. I am scared shitless and I am physically exhausted from using/drinking and sleep for almost 3 days straight. The sentence ended and i went home for the holidays. Immediatly we contacted the lawyer and had the rest of my sentence changed to be served on weekends in the cells in my college town of BC.

Part 2 in a bit. I need to take a little break, part two gets really nasty so stay tuned if you are interested.",

I even got 3 months of clean drug screen results printed out and showed them and he said "" you've cheated drug tests in the past we""ll never believe anything you say"". It really hurts so much. I think about it constantly and I just want to stick a needle in my arm and slam a tall boy to make the pain go away but that would mean they win and I'm a fuck up. I want my daughter and won't let myself mess up but the fact that nobody has faith in me gives me bad cravings. 
It does make me feel good that once I go to court and get her back that I'll prove them wrong. I always think that when I get her back I'll never take her to see them but I'm a better man than that.",

"Painful RC Benzo Withdrawal - Physical and Mental
I am an addict - 3 days sober. I am new to reddit, and I am trying it out as a therapy technique. I find it easier to express my thoughts in written form.


I have been around the block when it comes to RC Benzos. I have been in treatment, outpatient and inpatient, but I continue to relapse. Sedatives have always been my drug of choice because I tormented by my own thoughts. I fall into these slumps of drug abuse and depression that are incredibly detrimental to my life and the people in my life. 


My last 30 day stint of inpatient treatment was wonderful. I felt great coming out. And I was sober for a few months. Then I started drinking again. Then I started smoking pot everyday. Then I found an old bottle of flubromazolam pg solution in a stash. And that was that.


This went on for several weeks and was disastrous. I am struggling to rebound from this physically and mentally. This is my first extended stint using flubromazolam and this stuff is awful. With just one use my benzo tolerance seemed to skyrocket. My use ramped up quickly to the point where I would redose, forget that I redosed, and dose again.


I have been on gabapentin for years due to my benzo use and abuse so I am not worried about seizures. But even with the gabapentin this withdrawal is incredibly painful. My body is very sore, I have not slept in a few days, and it feels like my brain is being pulled out of my head. 


Mentally this is very tough for me because every time I relapse I seem to add baggage. This time I destroyed many relationships, lied, cheated, and had several visits from local detectives. I am struggling with this because I destroyed my support system, and now I am trying to recover with all the things I have done in my past and this new added baggage which could end with legal problems.


I see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, so atleast I have that support. Any words of encouragement are appreciated.",

"Feeling like I don't belong
Hey family!  Grateful to be part of this community today. 

I have a drug problem but I feel like I did not get bad enough or hit bottom yet. I have been trying to get clean since April 2015 and only started using right about early 2013. I am only 19 years old but my addiction has taken me to some dark places. Dealing drugs, knife pulled on me to my gut over an ounce of pot, smoking K2 at 15, morning drink at 18, family interventions and threats of homelessness, lasting less than a month at college, graduating high school by the skin of my teeth, wrecked relationships, the list goes on.

I have never shot drugs nor seen anyone do it. I have never seen heroin,  meth,  MDMA and many other things. I have only done acid twice. I haven't done as much cocaine in my whole life as real addicts do in one sitting. I wasn't using until 9th grade, most addicts start at 12. I only used drugs heavily for a couple years on and off. All these weird fleeting thoughts. Those are the things I think of to rationalize my drug use. 

I talk with my sponsor about it and have met several people who have gotten clean at my age. 

I just really need some help and reassurance that I do belong. I don't want to use drugs anymore. I have 5 months clean as of October 1st after several relapses. 

I am currently living in a sober house and working for $12 and feel like I don't have a chance because I didn't fuck up bad enough. It is awkward to talk about in meetings because I feel like people who didn't get it young will be jealous. 

Thanks, any feedback is greatly appreciated.

"I'm on day 3 or 4 of opiate recovery. Want a light hearted movie, but a good movie. Something that will make me feel, but not too much. Comedy preferred.
I don't need to get into all my history, if anyone cares, this account is entirely based on recovery and was only initially going to be for that one post. I found talking about it distracts from the restlessness and agitation that I feel.
Anyway like the title says. Thank you so much. I'm so glad to be doing this by my choice and to know 100% that that opiate anchor is in my past. I could ""cop"" if I wanted to. I do not.

"40 Days Clean and Sober
Good morning friends. I officially have 40 days clean and sober after yesterday. Feeling very blessed and watched over today. 

What I've been doing is simple but it works. I wake up and pray, I go to a meeting every day, I try to be if service in some small way without telling anyone about it, and I talk to another addict/alcoholic everyday that is living this way also one day at a time.

I went to a meeting last night and the young woman sharing told a lot of my story, and was asked by a young man afterwards to help guide him on the path. I felt humbled and honored, and I saw myself, both in him and in the speakers story.

That is the gift of this thing, my dark past has become the greatest asset I have. As we all know, junk is just another 9-5 gig, the hours are just a little more inclined to shadows. We are in this fight together, and it is in that fellowship that I find a piece of my strength.

Love and Light to all of you, you are appreciated. ",
"Avoiding your life
I have been in recovery a long ass time-all of my adult life and I am 46.

I have a couple of good friends that have either crossed over into Alcoholism or just can't seem to stay sober (sponsees).

It is baffling watching them.  I get that the craving is super strong. That's why lock down treatment worked for me. I had to have help to stay away from it until I completely detox ed.  These people have been through that process multiple times. It is so shitty.

So I have started asking -why do you keep drinking?

The short answer is...it is still working for them.

So I ask - what about it is so necessary for you.

The answer is...so I can check out/brown out/ or otherwise be able to check out of my life.

I guess that is one of the reasons I quit. It didn't work anymore.  I didn't really get any relief. I would drink and half the time I would wake up hours or days later into an absolute shit storm and have no idea about how I got there. Blackout drinking is a bitch.  I couldn't balance that line of staying drunk enough to dull my feelings and senses while staying conscious.  And blackout me -eek.  Let's just say that I am super glad my id isn't in control all the time because she sucks. 

So I didn't have much of a choice. I had to learn how to deal with my life fully conscious. Omg

So here are my buddies...drinking, hating there lives...but hanging on to what they see as relief.

I kind of understand it. Because in each case, these people have something they don't want to address.  

One is in an abusive relationship and has some family of origin issues she refuses to let go of (mom was a narcissist and Dad was an alcoholic and she feels specially tortured by the Universe because of this ).

One has some shame about a past failed business and not getting married/having a family.

Another has a chronic cancer situation. Which is scary because some day it will kill him and it forces him to see his mortality regularly. But in a practical level, he feels fine and is able to do all the normal life stuff- he just has extra Dr  visits.

These people also have lots and lots of good things in their lives-children, close friends, good jobs, live in beautiful places.

I get it. There is shit in my life that I don't want to deal with. Tax paperwork from a failed business. Having an autistic son that is violent and so no one wants to treat him.  That 20lbs I still have hanging around (keto is so good to me...why don't I just stick to it?)

I am reminded again about how perfectly the steps address my issues if I will just work them.

But I also understand why people wouldn't want to try.  

Acceptance is painful and oftem has a grief component.  I was willing to have faith that it would be better on the other side like people told me because I felt like I had no options.  So I was willing to walk through the pain.   

Today I know that things are so much deeper and truer and richer and more option filled when I accept the reality of my situations and walk through to the other side. 

I still resist sometimes even though I know this absolutely (example: old business paperwork)  because ai can be a little lazy sometimes. 

Tldr:  people often don't quit until they see no other option.  12 steps work. Acceptance is the answer to my problems. Blergh.

"Please tell me truthfully that it gets better
Ive been clean for 251 days now after abusing substance for ten years. Its been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. One of the most fucked up things about it is that I think I've done so well because I have some hope that in the future.. when I'm ""well"" again, I'll be able to moderate my usage like everyone else and use again. Despite a lot of the time being able to see and feel a VERY SLOW progress (know reality with stable mind state, not thinking i have dementia, paranoia, not shaking uncontrollably, not jumping at every sound etc) small things will project me into a whats the point mindset-the point in anything, I mean I cant even go back to drugs anymore, they got me here in the first place like the jealous best friend you love with all your heart even though you know, they are secretly sabotaging you while feeding you comfort and false senses. Everything takes an enormous amount of effort, and with any kind of rejection, I go ape. I want to punch everyone, I want to smash mirrors and doors. I want to shout at people, people closest to me, even for trying to tell me its temporary and things will get better. For the most part I can control myself, a part from the yelling at people. I don't want to be that person, but I can't even help it. With the lack of effort or motivation for anything I can't even be half of who I was when I was actually using and fully functional. I end up sitting catatonically agitated as fuck, seeing no future, no positive possibilities, being an annoying negative nancy and feeling like I want to destroy everything. I ignore and block out everything around me in spite. I was coping well five minutes ago, until I got a bit of bad news. Now everything is impossible and unbearable and everyone around me thinks my state is hilarious and/or really annoying including myelf. WHEN WILL THIS STOP? When does it get easier? When will I be able to cope without wanting to go back to drugs? When will I not feel the urge to smash up my environment? How do I move forward myself instead of waiting for time to do it for me, with no energy and a severed will power that's using all its credits not using? Can anyone relate and comfort me because I am wallowing in self pity and can't get out of this shit hole I dug while everyone saw it happening and happily gave me a helping hand. Thanks and sorry.

Edit: thank you guys so much, you have been really supportive with great advice. I really appreciate it! ",

"QDon't Give Up!
Hello Redditors! I just wanted to post a message to anyone who's fighting this ugly, dirty, life consuming, exhausting battle of addiction... I wanted to send a message to the addict who's sitting up alone, dope sick, feeling like the night will never end because... I am you, and I know that feeling. I know wishing and praying for the will to stop only to be overtaken by the sickness that creeps in after hours since your last shot. I know throwing away every spoon and rig only to dig through the trash hoping one isn't completely destroyed because you spent every penny to get dope and now have no way to do it. I know being sick for days only to give in because you haven't slept in 2 days, 3 days, 4 days... ""How long did you make it this time? I lost count..."" I know deleting every dopeman's phone number, but you know them by heart so it doesn't matter. I know the sweating, the chills, the vomiting, the shits, the pains running up and down your legs. I know the bruises all over your arms, searching your entire body for a vein that works. There's one in your forehead if you tie off around your neck... I know how sick it makes you to look at yourself in the mirror while you hit that vein because the rest of them are trashed. I know how alone you feel, and I just want to be the one to tell you... That you aren't. 
Because I know all those feelings, but I also know some more. I know what it feels like to wake up that first day after you have finally slept. I know driving past your old dealers house, and watching it disappear out of the rearview mirror. I know wearing short sleeves without coming up with inventive ways to cover up bruises because... There are none. I know being broke because your bills are paid. I know regaining trust. I know celebrating one day clean... Everyday for 365 days. 
I don't know all the details of your story, but I know you can beat this because I did. I'm not saying my struggle is over because I'm not sure if it'll ever, truly, end. But, it gets easier everyday. This will be one of the hardest things you ever do, but it can be done. I just understand how lonely and scary stopping can be so I wanted to send out an open letter to anyone reading this who's even thinking about quitting. I just wanted you to know... You are NOT alone and you CAN do this! ",
"2 months sober from booze...and I switched to a seemingly harmless, new addiction.
I'm 2 months sober from alcohol. I'm still in a very fragile place so it's hard to be happy about that (I miss whiskey!). 

Oddly enough I've begun drinking what I think is a very large amount of canned seltzer water. I'm drinking about 12 cans a day. 

Some things mirror my old addiction in terms of ritual (having to plan to go to the store to buy it everyday, becoming anxious if there's none in the house). But other things don't. For example, my alc. of choice did not usually come in a can (esp. at the end of my drinking). 

Anecdotally, I know a few other people in recovery who drink a lot of seltzer water, although I don't know if it's to the extent that I am. Anyone ever heard anything about this? Is it just me? Do we all simply find something new to obsess over in our early days? Or is there something about seltzer water that a lot of people with addiction are attracted to? 

I know this is a pretty mundane question. But maybe some of you know how the first few months of sobriety are. This is a big deal to me for some reason. ",

"Day 1 coming back from a relapse
Today was my first day clean, though I have been going to a few meetings here and there through out my relapse. I made it to a meeting tonight and saw a bunch of familiar faces who wanted to see how I was doing. 

I was supposed to get a ride from someone I met at a meeting recently, but then about 20 minutes before he shut his phone off. I ended up taking an uber cause I already planned to go to the meeting. It made me realize how much this shit is on me rather than other people. I do need the support of others, but they can't just make me clean.

I got rid of all my drugs a few hours after the meeting, and while I'm physically not too well, my mind is finally free! It felt crazy good to get rid of the drugs, which were worth a lot of money. The money kept holding me back from disposing of them but I realized that was just my mind playing tricks on me. Life's not all about money anyways.

"Starting to think the 12 steps wont work for me (long post)
I need help, and I'm not sure where else to go. I'm open to anything, so feel free to PM me or comment any suggestions you have for me

Before I start, let me say that I'm not one of those people who argues ""I'm an atheist and haven't actually looked into the steps but they won't work for me because they talk about God"" or anything like that. I've actually gotten some clean time in AA before, a couple of 4-5 month stints, and one time I had over 2 years. I've been very active in several fellowships over the years. I've sponsored people, hosted YPAA conferences, held positions on GSO and intergroup, taken meetings into jails and institutions, and done just about everything my sponsors have suggested to me over the years.

I keep relapsing. This last time, I was doing everything I could think of to help myself. I graduated Sober Living, was working full time at a job I enjoy, had plenty of friends in the fellowship, was hitting 1-2 meetings a day, went to the gym several times a week, had multiple service commitments, brought meetings in to jails and institutions, working steps (I was on step 9 when I relapsed), talking to my sponsor, prayed and meditated throughout the day each day, was eating healthy, was avoiding dating (especially apps like Tinder and POF), and had a healthy relationship with my family. I was doing fun sober things on the weekends with people I liked, and really was doing everything I could think of to better myself. I had hit a really hard bottom before this time, and was completely done and surrendered everything to a God of my understanding. 

One day, no different than any before it, I had done my daily routine. I talked to several friends from the program, talked to my sponsor, prayed, meditated, hit my home group, and brought a meeting in to jail. I was feeling really good. I went to the grocery store near my house to get food at the end of the night, and saw this dude who was obviously nodding out outside the store. I went into autopilot mode, and ended up cold-copping some heroin off him. It's been several weeks now, and I've since almost lost my job, distanced myself from the fellowship, gotten uninvited to Christmas with my family, lost several pounds, and collapsed several veins in my arms.

My question is this, I was a really active member of the fellowship, and was doing all this stuff for my recovery, and in one quick instant, gave it all away. I've been in and out of the rooms for 5 years now, am I one of those people who just won't ever get it? Are there any alternatives to the 12 steps that I should try? I dont know how much longer I can keep fighting this fight. It gets pretty disheartening to relapse so many times. Every time things start to look up in my life, I mess it all up and wind up strung out on heroin again. I've been to 7 rehab centers, detox more times than I can think of, thousands of meetings, jail, have tried Suboxone, more psychiatrists than I care to count... I really just don't know what else to do. And it's not like I just go to meetings and fuck off, I really participate and get in the middle. I just cant seem to find lasting sobriety.",

In the day


Before everything


Went to shit


I remember good times


We developed


Laugh lines


I never thought that those


Times would end


Then you went away


Something in you


Changed


It started in the form


Of a pill


That’s when I realized


I could see it


In your eyes


Something inside you


Had grown ill



At first I tried


To save you


Give you someone to


Confide to


You had grown so weak, so


I had to be strong


I had no clue how to


Begin to even help you


If you couldn’t even


Admit you were


Wrong


Soon the poison in you


Began to make decisions


For you


Until what was You


Wasn’t you anymore


It seems that I was


Too late


You’ve accepted


Your fate


Abuse has won


And you helped


Rig the score





There are times


I want to beat you


Unseat you


For letting a substance


Defeat you


For letting it change you


And make you


Do things you would


Never do


You let it control you


Console you


Wear a mask


Made from your guilt


And so now you’re gone then


So long then


Hide behind the lies


That you’ve built


Inside I’m just so angry


I thought that maybe


The person I knew


Was buried deep within


But you’re an empty shell now


You’ve built your own hell now

"So now I am sure I want to quit
Hey, I am new here, so I don't know how it works, but I will give it a try looking for someone that may related.
I was a heroin daily user for one year when I was 20 years old. One day I woke up and decided to stop. Never used again. Now I am 23 years old.
Last year I got addicted to cocaine. I used daily, for 6 months, 2-3g a day. I decided to quit and I did for the next 6 months. 
August 11 I started again and in the first week I was already back into 2-3g daily use. The problem is that this time I lost myself.
Last week I decided that I would try to overdose, so than I would die or live. If I did not die, I would stop it.
Last friday I started doing 6g a day. My main objective was to be awake the whole time. So I am awake for an entire week. By counting the bags, I have used 50g of cocaine this week.
I did not overdose. I felt very bad every day, but I manage to simply go on with this madness.
I am very sorry for who I became. But I am still hoping I can fix everything and go back to normal life.

"Addict's Family Member Seeking Support Advice On Providing The Basics Without Allowing Those Privileges To Be Abused.
I hope I am posting this in the right place - apologies in advance if there is a more appropriate sub, but I can't seem to find it.

TLDR: My cousin is an addict. How can we give him access to food, cigarettes and gas without him abusing the privilege.

I'm a family member trying to help the best way possible, but I have a couple of issues and I was hoping I could call on our collective conscious for some direction or insight...

Background:

My cousin is the loveliest guy. He can light up a room in a second. His aura could defrost Antarctica. You can't help but love him.

He is an addict. Vodka. Heroin. Coke. Crack. You name it. He loves it.

He's had clean spells, but more often than not things catch up with him and the wheels fall off.

He can't hold down a job for long before things get problematic.

He's currently in rehab for the fifth time.

His mother and his stepfather are pretty well off. They don't want to see him homeless. Nobody wants to see him homeless. Hell, nobody wants to see anyone homeless. 

They want to help by providing the basics whilst he's back in this adjustment period.

Paying for his gas, cigarettes and food.

But he's proven he can't be trusted with a credit card or cash and nobody has the time to babysit his every move. 

How can we make sure he gets the basics but isn't able to abuse the privileges?

I was wondering if anyone had ever been in a similar situation and had a system that works?",
"Just a little over two months sober and even though I live in constant fear of relapse, I'm doing pretty alright.
I've struggled with alcohol addiction for well over seven years and I've spent a year and a half of those seven years trying to completely sober up. Through that time, I've come to learn why I drank at the excess that I did. I live in constant fear of my emotions and I'm afraid that my feelings will constantly drag me down. When I hadn't come out to my family, I drank so that I wouldn't have to think about what they would say. I kept thinking I would be the family disappointment if they ever found out. My father was a highly decorated pilot, my brother contributes massive amounts of research in his field, my cousin is a sought after model and I was on track to becoming a professor of writing. Coming from a family of high achievers means I have a lot I have to live up to and yet, despite all of this, I would be only person in this lineage who was gay. I was scared to be the odd one out. So I drank.

All my attempts at getting sober were failures. I'd be clean for a few weeks then out of fear that I might relapse, I would relapse. Then the cycle would start again. I'd be clean for a while, be scared that I would relapse, and then relapse. For someone who has never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, I lived in fear every day. Sometimes it wasn't fear that caused this. It could have been something like the Orlando shooting which caused me to mourn nearly fifty of my brothers and sisters. Being riddled with survivor's guilt caused me to drink more than I ever could have thought and was unquestionably my worst relapse.

Come a couple of weeks after this, I'm going to some Fourth of July parties with a close friend of mine. He's like a brother to me and if it wasn't for him, I don't think I'd ever be where I am today. After waking up from these parties, he comes to my room with a cup of tea. He tells me he's never seen me drink to the excess that I did the night before. I ask him exactly how much. He said I did seven keg stands in a row without breaks and following the last one, I took a triple shot of something that was handed to me. His next words meant the absolute world to me.

""I know you've been struggling for a while. But after seeing you last night, I genuinely thought you were trying to kill yourself. I want you to get better. And if I have to be the one to support you every step of the way, I'll do it. I don't want to watch my best friend destroy their life.""

I initially shook it off. I told him I don't need help. I told him that I tried and failed so many times and this wouldn't be any different. But since his words were the first thing I heard that day, I couldn't stop thinking about them. By the end of the day, I called him and through tears and broken sentences, I told him I wanted to finally be clean.

So as of the 6th of this month, I have been two months sober. Even though I live in constant fear that I would go back, I can at least take comfort in the fact that this time, I have support. I have someone who I can call at three in the morning when I have fears that I could relapse. That same person messages me every day asking how I'm feeling that day. That same person goes with me to my meetings. That same person told me that didn't want to watch me destroy my life.

And I'd say right now, I feel pretty alright.",
"illustrator/artist in recovery?
I'm in early recovery, but have collected a few chips and tags.  I wrote a little children's book about a parent going away from the family for a little while to get help.
It was a project that helped me in the loneliest times when I woke up without the company of my twins.

I'm seeking a visual artist, in recovery or interested in the project, to take this idea to completion with me.  It's up to higher powers if it will have life beyond just coming into existence, but I really want to get it fully realized. I see it as having approximately 10 illustrations or paintings or what have you.

Thanks,

"a new milestone I never thought I would reach
Those of us in recovery from addiction have many markers to keep track of our time clean and sober. I used to struggle staying drug free for just a day or even less. 
When I got clean I was overjoyed by each marker, 
my first week I was amazed.
 A month? felt awesome!
 6 months? Wow!
 I can remember my gratitude for my 1st year clean and sober, I could hardly believe it, and each marker makes me more grateful.
Well time marches on and I got to thinking of how many days it has been since I turned my addiction over to God as I understand him and marked it on my calendar.
Today makes a total of 10'000 days of being %100 drug and alcohol free.
Being clean and sober has given me so much, not just being free from drugs and alcohol, but a life that is fulfilling and meaningful. I have a beautiful Wife and Family with a wonderful Grand Daughter, all of which I would have missed. 
I thank all those who have supported and encouraged me in my sobriety, and God most of all who gave me the strength to do it.",
"Two years!
2014 was an interesting year.  I started it off with a new job, I smoked a pack and a half a day, and I used about $1k/month coke, easy.  The new job was going good, so I picked up a new car. Stopped smoking, and used my smoke money for more coke. Then I got a promotion. I was now the CFO of a pretty profitable company, I could afford my drugs, and nobody knew. I was on top of the world!

Well, two years ago today, I got high, like every other day. Two years ago today I lost consciousness while driving the car I'm actually sitting in right now (I'm parked). Somehow, I didn't crash, and my next memory was pure terror. I had covered about four blocks, was still in motion, and was also in residential. The adrenaline, along with the extra line I had allowed myself to have minutes prior, now had my heart racing. It was so hard to concentrate, I felt like I could blackout again at any second. I was scared, and I wondered if I should get myself to the hospital, since I had never felt like this before. High me got back home, and had convinced myself that I wouldn't wake up (idk), but told myself if I did, I was done. I gave that new eight ball I had just bought to someone else the next day.

I've pushed all of my former drug friends out of my life, except one who means a lot to me, who now lives 800 miles away. I reconnected with an old friend who had gotten tied up with meth/heroin; she's over 400 days clean. She and I are going out to celebrate my anniversary this weekend. Another new friend is going on 12 years clean off meth, and is currently riding his bike across the USA. One friend, that I don't see often enough, is over two decades clean. His strength to stay clean, when his DOC was widely available (alcohol), helped me reach this point.

I never have attended a class or meeting. Found some new hobbies, and used my drug money for a shop and some old cars. The post I made recently about being overwhelmed by drug talk, was solved by leaving my client that was using.

So here's to being a 37 year old addict that is two years clean. There will be many more years to come. 😄

FWIW, I stayed away from cigarettes too.",
"Started using heroin. I'm afraid.
The circumstances of my life over the past ten years have been really hard for me to deal with.  It all started with getting raped and losing my life to PTSD.  I'm a 42 year old female and live with my parents.  My mother is emotionally abusive.  I'm chronically unemployed and live in suburbs with no access to the family cars and feel very trapped.  I've never had any DUI's or anything like that.  Not letting me use the cars is just one of many ways my family controls me.  Heroin addiction is something I thought could never happen to me but I fear it is now.  I haven't been using that long and might not be chemically dependent yet.  Maybe if I throw it all out now I have a chance.  I use because I have nothing to do with my days and have watched every person I know in life surpass me in every area.  I've been using to numb myself.  I just bought what for me was a large quantity ($90 worth) and fear that by the time I go through it I'll be chemically dependent.  I don't feel like I have the strength to throw it out today.  The only thing I have going for me is that I don't have a lot of money so I have no way to support a habit.  I don't feel ready to stop, and don't know if I can stop on my own.  Any suggestions about what I should do and suggestions about what other subs would be good for my issue would be greatly appreciated.

I'm in an Intensive Outpatient Program for Bipolar Disorder and PTSD and I admitted the heroin use to my therapists and psychiatrist recently.  They referred me to a different outpatient program for people with substance abuse issues in addition to psychiatric problems and I'll be starting that soon so that's a good thing but it doesn't matter unless I stop.  I need help.
I know the answer is obvious.  I should just stop, but it's not that easy.  I need help.

ETA:  Thank you to everyone who responded.  I threw out the $90 worth of heroin, deleted the dealer's number, ripped up the hardcopy of the number, threw out a bowl, a shit ton of wine, and a vape pen, went to an AA meeting, and asked a competent and great woman to be my sponsor.  I feel like I was at a cross roads today and made good decisions for myself that are far reaching.  I know I have to stay vigilant i.e. going to meetings everyday for 90 days, follow through with step work, and deal with withdrawal if symptoms start to arise.  Thanks again to everyone.  It really was just enough dope to ruin my life.  This was scary.

"Officially Overwhelmed.
My favorite thing about recovery has been that for the most part all that free floating anxiety I’d struggle with daily is gone. I wake up and I don’t immediately freak out about what I may have said/done/fucked up the night before.  I don’t have to decide if I am too hungover to do what needs to be done. No worries about if I have enough pills to kill the hangover and kick me into go mode.  No racing thoughts about shit I can’t control.  

But this week.  
This week has been a motherfucker.   My husbands job ends in 3 weeks and we are both going to unemployed.  We’re good for 6 months. I’ve known this for a while and it’s been okay.  We’ve been here before. 
We're moving to the other coast July 1st and the house I had set up to rent fell thru yesterday.  The people who were to rent our house to said they reconsidered.  I’m expecting to lose the deposit I paid to movers.  No big, in the grand scheme.  

And then there’s the tumor.  I had 4 questionable lumps core biopsied last week. One doesn’t look so great.  Surgery this week to really get in there and see what’s what.  So I’m speed packing to beat the down time I’m going to have to take.  Husband doesn’t do packing, which is probably for the best.  He does other things, helpful things, but tends to do them stoned.  This hasn’t bothered me up until now.  Now I just can’t deal with the brain fog it causes and how difficult that makes it to communicate.  My frustration isn’t helping.  He’s not much easier to communicate with when he’s not high.

I’m just cooked.  Over it. Tired.  

I’m grateful to be sober thru this and I know that its making everything easier.  It’s also making things harder in that newly sober sort of way.  Shit sucks right now.  First world problem rant over.  Thanks for reading.  ",

Hey /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY, we need your help. We are a team of physicians, engineers, scientists, and designers at MIT who are currently participating in a healthcare hackathon. Our team is working to develop a system for opioid users who are in recovery or who want to transition into recovery. Our main mission is to empower users to lead their own journey to recovery.
We are focusing on individuals’ social environment and using already-existing tools to promote autonomy during recovery. We’re looking to understand how you interact with your friends and family, your experiences with employment, and how they’ve affected your recovery process.
Any comments and feedback are welcome, and for those interested, we have a much longer, confidential interview that we would love to collect answers from via PM. Thanks guys!

"Needing to get away from the powder
Ok, throwaway acc because i am a 8 year addict and feel the shame of exposure just may kill me. 

Started drinking and smoking weed when i was 13, graduated to a full on pothead and borderline alcoholic by 16 and started using coke when i was 21.

I always wondered what it would be like as a child, glamourisation by TV and music maybe turned me on to it, or perhaps it was the history of drug abuse which runs in my family, either way curiousity took a hold of me and i tried it. 

First time it sucked, not very high, kind of disorientating, generally just a weird foreign feeling within my body. Second time i took of like a rocket. I still remember that feeling well, chasing it for several years sometimes getting close but never quite reaching it. Sometimes the coke was good, clean product, nice happy buzz with no savage comedown, but 8/10 times it was garbage which hurt my nose, throat and eyes. My body all over would ache, and i would swear this would be the last time. 

I remember when i was 6 months to a  year into it and made my first decision to quit... oh how the sun was shining that day. 

Nevertheless i underestimated the power of cocaine. Especially when combined with liquor. I love to drink more than smoking and snorting but thats another issue im addressing seperately. Today is about the rails.

I have tried, albeit not 100% if im being honest, to quit yet have hit various stumbling blocks along the way. Iv changed friend circles, changed numbers and got a new job to try and break the cycle. Ive been to therapy, but never told her about my drug addiction we mainly focussed on drinking. Part of me is still too ashamed to admit im really in trouble.

I use on average every 2/3 days usually a 0.5 to 1g dose. Sometimes more. Last night was 1.5g  ... £120 up my nose, im disgusted at my behaviour and really feel like now is the time to quit. Iv seperated from all but 2 dealers. One is a customer of mine so i simply delete his number after he calls me which is easily enough done. The other is my cousin which makes it a little harder as we are quite close, but he is also going through this shit and is supportive as possible. But you know another addict isnt the best person for support at times like this.

I have a wife, a child, a job, a music career im currently avoiding like the plague, and alot more to live for than this. I dont even get high anymore, i just get normal then come back to feelin a bit low. No mad hangovers, no sinking feeling of despair, just ... nothingness. I feel like if this shit is no longer getting me high, and it is just costing me money then this really is the end of the road for me. 

I dont want to quit, i have to quit, because its just not pleasing me anymore. So before it affects me any further im making the conscious effort to change my ways.

My sober life begins today.

Thanks for listening, it means alot.",

"New Years Eve
The last day of the calendar year brought me to the last page in a journal I've been keeping since early April. It began as a notebook, slowly filling with ideas, things I heard at meetings, my own musings on recovery, and evolved into a daily exercise:

'...Last New Years Eve and morning, I could not shake the fear that grew when I recalled what I was doing one year prior. This morning, however, I face the day with gratitude rather than disdain. I find freedom rather than fear, and I appreciate all of the help that has gotten me to where I am today.
Walking around Boston was tough this past week. The partial snow cover, ice and wind take me back to the winter of 2013/14, when I was withering away mentally. However, it didn't take long for the right perspective to take hold and cap the rising anxiety that used to cripple me. At any point in my day I can find a litany of things not only to thank my higher power for, but which are reminders of how much I have, and how little I really need. 

In sharp contrast to the short sleeves, out of season and out of region over coat, laceless dress shoes and ill-fitting pants I was arrested in, today I am warm, comfortable, and even have options on what to wear.

When I think back to my first two purchases, when released on bail: I bought a burner cell phone, bottle of whiskey, and case of beer. Today, I am completing laundry, drinking nice coffee, and enjoying a morning relatively free of responsibility or stress, after a full nights sleep in a comfortable bed. I am going to exchange a nice new pair of boots today, see friends at my home group, and look forward to working two jobs this weekend, where I am appreciated and paid. 

I manage my health today. I call my mother regularly. I show up when expected, don't steal toothpaste, razors, and spare change from roommates to get by. I find tasks I used to muster patience for a pleasure today. 

I don't know what will happen to me today, but I'm quite positive that I'll be wearing gloves, not handcuffs; confident that I won't be looking over my shoulder in fear; I will keep my belt, shoelaces, perspective, gratitude, and sobriety. ",

"Should I go to NA/AA meetings even if I do not believe in the theology of NA/AA?
Hello forum,

This is my first time using this forum, and I looked for it because I had a question.  I hope this is a good place to post this.

I have been doing NA/AA for several months. I like a lot of the people, but I do not subscribe to the theology of it all. The whole ""you are powerless"" thing (I disagree; if I were ""powerless"" then how am I sober today? Because I have power), and the whole ""God"" thing (I'm atheist) and the whole ""turn your will and your life over to the care of your higher power/god"" (I would like to keep my will and my life, thank you, that is why I sobered up).  

I have nothing against spirituality - but my sense of spirituality does not include any sense of a ""higher power that will restore me..."" (or do anything in particular for me, for that matter.)

People at the meetings often have an attitude of: ""Well you *must* believe in a higher power - in the sense that this higher power will help me, and that I should turn my will over to that higher power - or else you will not succeed.""  

I find this attitude quite irritating, as I grew up in a strict, supposedly ""Good Catholic"" family (in label but not in practice), and I went to Catholic school until I went to high school.  I came to decide I was an atheist of my own accord, as an adult, once the pressure of reading the bible daily and attending church twice a week had lifted. 
So the attitude of ""You must believe in a higher power (all too often, coincidentally, in the very Western Christian dogmatic sense of God) to remain sober and recover,""  is particularly irritating to me because I really don't want to relapse but I really don't believe in any of this theology, and it's not for lack of having an open mind or considering it. 

While I find this attitude detrimental and aggravating, it is not a deal breaker for me, because I like some of the people I meet at meetings and there is a wide range of attitudes and beliefs amongst such a large and diverse fellowship.

However, I feel weird going to the meetings when I do not subscribe to the theology.  Where I live, there are not other recovery groups. I checked, I've researched, and there are not any other in-person recovery support groups anywhere near where I live. 

I want to meet people in person who are in recovery. The meetings offer a convenient and easy way to do this.  I do not agree with the theology of it.  I had a sponsor for a while, but she was very insistent on me praying, and having faith in my higher power to take care of my life for me, and well, after months of her advice and support and help consisting entirely of her telling me to have faith that my higher power would do it all for me and that all I needed to do was pray daily: (""If you do not believe in prayer, then pray for the belief in prayer""), I got tired of this and broke it off, amicably enough. 

Should I go to these meetings at all? I don't know, it makes me feel weird because I disagree with the theology and I do not want to get another sponsor (until I find the right person, which may take a while).  

What does anyone else think?

"Feeling disillusioned with AA
Well, I've been in AA this time around for about a year, and lately I've been sort of turned off by the meetings and the program.  I see people in the rooms who have been going for years and years, and I often wonder if going to meetings and doing the AA motions is sort of an addiction in itself to replace drugs/alcohol.  I am sometimes repulsed by the ""groupthink"" that goes around the AA community. Particularly that AA's version of recovery is the only valid or effective way to recover from addiction.  There are also certain individuals who share about the miracle of AA working in their lives, but who behave like total assholes outside of meetings.  I know I should not be ""taking their inventory"" but it just makes me feel like the whole thing is a farce. 

I would like to ask others here if they have ever felt similarly, and if so, what did they change about themselves or their actions to keep their peace of mind and sobriety?

"What otherwise horrific thing are you actually thankful for because it got you into recovery?
My husband, who is in recovery, shared with me the story of two of his friends (a couple who he's met in recovery). At one point, they were both high or fiending and arguing, and one of them got so angry they poured red-hot cooking oil over the other one's head.

This was their rock bottom. A decade ago. And they are both THANKFUL that it happened (as in, ""I don't know where we'd be if I/they hadn't done that"").

I've been struggling with acceptance regarding things my husband has done in active addiction, and this story brought tears to my eyes. I was shaking, speechless at the grace that it takes to be able to see something so horrific as a blessing.

"I just flushed a large amount of drugs. Hoping for something of a new beginning.
Greetings. Within the last hour of me posting this I just got rid of a drug hoard reminiscent of Raul Duke in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, though more obscure indeed. Items flushed included (gram + qty of each)

4-AcO-DMT

4-HO-MET

25i-nBOME (50+ blotters)

3-MeO-PCP

2-FA

4-FA

5-MAPB

MDMA

14g p. cubensis

I just can't be this person anymore. Several days over the last few months I was many hours late to work due to binging on 2-FA and 4-FA on worknights, taking etizolam to crash, then failing to hear my alarm only to awake several hours later to concerned calls and texts from coworkers. Drugs like MDMA and 4-FA barely effect me anymore, no matter how long the break. Years of abuse of those type of drugs tend to do that I suppose.

I snorted 4-FA @ 200mg about 3 hours ago and am pretty much sober. I'm afraid to develop an etizolam habit. I am afraid that I'm going to sit in my room and get high all the time the rest of my life. I am afraid that the more I close the rest of the world out, the deeper I'll pull myself into that weird place I know all too well. That lonely feeling. Ashamed feeling. Disappointed not only in the effects most of the time but in myself all of the time, in one way or another. Whether it was from the list of drugs above or the laundry list of other obscure RCs and more typical chems I've done in my life.

Am I an addict? Physically, I guess not. Mentally, I think so. I'm just trying to cover up some different emotional issues most of the time. Happiness in a chemical, it might be there but for a fleeting moment, but the costs always seen to outweigh the gain. I didn't come from some particularly fucked up life, but I certainly made one for myself over the years. 

I want to concentrate on myself. I want to be somebody I can look at the mirror and respect, it's been a long time. I want to feel like I have the self worth to have something to offer to someone. 

I hope...",

"Started going to LifeRing meetings. I've now got over a month clean and sober!
After relapsing multiple times and running in to some very deep frustrations during the past couple of years while trying AA, I decided I needed to do something radically different and decided to try a program I had only heard about in passing called LifeRing. For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox_DYxdkQRA) is a short video from the LifeRing [website](http://www.lifering.org) that briefly explains the basic premise behind the LifeRing philosophy. 

Being an athiest, the prospect of having to rely upon some form of divine intervention or a higher power to stay sober completely rubbed me the wrong way. There was always an overwhelming sense of dogma and I did not feel comfortable whatsoever in the packed meetings. I tried time and time again in AA to work the steps to the best of my ability but always found myself morally opposed to AA and the 12 Step approach. 

Upon going to my first LifeRing meeting I found that the format and structure was much more to my liking. The meetings were small and crosstalk was encouraged in a constructive way. It was an actual discussion where a dialog was formed amongst the group as opposed to a one-sided conversation like I experienced in AA because crosstalk is incredibly taboo in the meetings in my area. 

So far I have over a month clean and sober and I think I might have found a program that actually might work for me! My resolve to stay sober has been stronger than ever and it seems to be getting easier and easier every day.

"I keep coming back.
I'm Hannah and I'm an addict.

I just needed to get some stuff out.

I have 52 days today.

In the past I was told I had to go to AA meetings by my managers at work after repeatedly coming to work hung over (I used to call it an SII or self-induced illness).

I have been forced to go to anger management classes by a different job after punching a coworker.
Yet another job I had paid for me to go to see a therapist while I was on the clock to ""get my head straight"".

It took me a very long time (over ten years) to admit that I had a problem with alcohol. It took me even longer to admit that the diet pills and prescription pain killers were an issue.

It took me even longer to realize that I was substituting one thing for another.

I started going to NA meetings a couple months ago to support my SO who is a former meth dealer and addict. I knew he had a problem with meth, coke, weed, just about everything. I never thought that I would get anything out of it.

It took me some time (and several meetings) before I could even say that I myself was an addict. My SO never saw it because he was so wrapped up in his own active addiction.

I thought that I was better than him (and other addicts) because the things I did were legal; drinking, taking pills my doctor prescribes me and that I could buy OTC at walmart or a health supply store.

I hid what I was doing from everyone, but mostly myself.
Through NA I am learning so much about myself. I see how long ago the issues started, long before the alcohol and pills. I started cutting on myself in junior high and the most recent time was about 6 months ago. I went through, to put it nicely, promiscuous periods of my life. It has always been something. Nearly my whole life I jumped back and forth from one thing to another or multiple things.

My fear now is that if I am not doing these things then what is there? Am I apt to substitute another poor behavior?

I am hoping to get a sponsor soon. I am starting to call people and talk more to people. I am trying to get to meetings early and stay late if I can so I can hear more of what people say and feel out what I like or can relate to.

I am really loving the fellowship. I love the hugs. I never felt so at home and comfortable with so many people. We are all different, yet share a connection that non addicts just can't understand.

And that's why I keep coming back.

Sorry I rambled so long. Thank you for listening.",

"I've been asked to chair my (NA) home group; very nervous.
As the title suggests, I have been asked to chair my home group starting next month. My sponsor supports this opportunity fully, but I am nervous. I am not good at speaking up for myself or at engaging in confrontational situations, so I fear that I will not be able to maintain order in the group. I know that my fellow home group members will be supportive and will aid me if necessary, but I am caught up in my head right now. I've tentatively accepted the position, as we are desperate for chair members and our group sees a significant slide in attendance during the summer months (so I don't think it'll be quite so scary as when we have 150+ in attendance). I would really appreciate hearing about others who have chaired NA meetings, or from anyone who has any sort of advice.",

"Coming up on one year.
It's been 363 days since I used and I can't figure out how to feel about it. I went the first 9 months lying and saying I never relapsed. I worked the steps back in mid-January. Then my sponsor started using my 5th step as story time about a month ago. I got a new sponsor about a week ago. Tomorrow night is going to be interesting. I'm starting my step work again, then going to my favorite 11PM meeting which will end on my 1 year anniversary, when they're handing out the chips. Some people will be there expecting me to pick it up, not thanks to me pointing it out though. I feel guilty. I didn't earn this. What the fuck would I say as to how I did it? Sure, new comer, you can let your guilt overtake you after getting fucked up in the rooms and just stop. Do nothing to work for it, while spending 9 goddamn months getting even more miserable than when I was risking jailtime when getting caught high or drunk once would send me to prison? Go ahead and trust a dishonest, charismatic fucking prick to tell shit to that you've never told anyone? I realize this idea would probably turn out badly, especially the whole getting kicked out of my sober living house, but I want to go get a new sober date so I can be the newcomer that I feel like.

I have close to 18 months clean, and I just now finished my first step. Saying I procrastinated is an understatement. Although it did take me over 6 months to even start it, finished it, and then some months to even sit down with my sponsor. 

Just wanted to let somebody know that it feels good. If you're in a 12 step program, don't do what I did and wait to start working the steps, your only holding yourself back.",

"Back in the saddle, and loving it. 
Only yesterday I made a post about how sad/lonely/poor me/unmotivated I was feeling. And my attitude has changed so much in the past 24 hours.

I went to my second AA meeting today and it was everything I hoped for and more. It was PACKED and it felt so good to know that we were all their for same purpose, we all want to make changes that benefit ourselves and stop the destruction. Everyone who shared was brave and open about their struggles and how much better there lives are because of their sobriety. 

I think I may have found a sponsor and have starting reading the Big Book. (I also checked out a few of the online meetings semibro suggested) Today I found the community and collective desire for recovery that I have been needing so much. (while it is ever-present here, I'm sure many of you understand how important it is the feel the energy from other people)

I feel rejuvenated and ready to keep going on this journey.

"Hey guys, just a reminder that everyday that you get stronger in sobriety, your addiction is getting stronger as well.
Please don't ever think you have this thing beat because you won't and you never will be. There is no destination in recovery and there are only checkpoints. If you ever notice yourself getting cocky about your sobriety, realize this is your addiction trying to trick you.

I just came back from a wake for a guy who i live with in the recovery home i'm at. He went out on an overnight pass  supposedly to be with his family but went out with old friends to a bar and drank. One thing lead to another and he was doing coke and heroin and he overdosed. The ""friend"" he was with pushed him out of the car and left him for dead in his parents' front house. His mother unfortunately found him that morning at 9 a.m. when she was taking out the trash.

Although he's gone and i will miss him very much, im trying to take this as a learning experience and you guys should too. For those of you who didn't have a problem with alcohol, as you hear at every NA meeting, alcohol is a drug. Period. One of two things will happen. 1.) you will either drink and never go back to your drug of choice but instead start substituting with alcohol or 2.) you will have lowered inhibitions from the alcohol and go back to your drug of choice either from the inebriation or because the buzz youre lookong for can only be attained by your drug of choice. Also, please be aware of who you hang out with. As far as meeting new people, even people at meetings, its good to know who's who in the zoo. Pick and choose who will hold you accountable and be beneficial to your recovery and who will drag you down and enable you. 

Also, stay away from old using/drinking buddies unless they're working an honest program of recovery as well. Absolutely no good can come out of hanging out with old using friends even if at first you dont plan on using with them. 

Most importantly, its absolutely crucial that you yourself recognize your relapse warning signs. Although others can help point these out to you when you start showing them, most reside within you and only you can be the one to notice them. No one living here with brandon and any of his friends noticed anything different about him. So please make a list of relapse warning signals so that you are conscious of them and so you can bring them to other people's attention.

Stay strong you guys. Even though we lost a fellow brother to this affliction that we call addiction, we can take a lesson from each negative thing that happens in our lives.

I love you guys!",
"I almost relapsed tonight...I need help
Reddit I need your help. 

My DOC was Meth. 
Tonight, one of my old smoking friends (who had also gotten clean for a while) text me and asked me if I wanted to hang out. He knows I quit, and he was respectful to say there will be dope there if I'm still trying to stay clean I should probably avoid it. When he first told me there would be dope there I was all for it, but as I was waiting for him to come pick me up I got really nervous and scared and text him and told him not to pick me up.

I've been clean for about 4 months. And still every time someone mentions it in pass, I see it online, anything; I get that hunger. I want to just go smoke a bowl.

I'm just happy at this particular moment I was able to fight the urge and not go, but I could always still have him pick me up....

"Suggestions for a detox nurse?
I am a nurse who recently started working in a drug/alcohol detox. I hear stories/memories/situations from my patients every day that I am unsure how to respond to and I cannot really relate and don't know how to help. 

Any suggestions to help me help them is appreciated. 

Thank you. 

Edit: Thank you for your comments! I will try to elaborate. We see patients using pretty much all substances but the majority are opiates and benzos, with some alcohol use. The patients generally talk about how hard it is to be an addict, how many of them have lost everything due to their addiction, the women talk about losing their children to social services, etc. I am just looking for any sort of advice on how to best treat my patients... I'm afraid I'm not wording this very well. :/ 

I just don't know how to help them get clean/ stay clean... so many come onto the floor and leave the next day and don't actually detox. Having never had an addiction personally, I don't know how to help them stay in the detox or if I should if they want to leave. 

Honestly, anything you can think of that someone in a detox/ recovery program did to help you would be great to hear if you don't mind sharing. 

TLDR: New nurse, teach me how to best help you please!

"How do you date when you're in recovery?
I'm a 27 year old guy, who previously dated successfully while being an addict for many years (keeping that bad behavior in my own closet), but am socially struggling now that I'm out of rehab + 6 months clean (9 months total.) After some long consideration, I've just started dating again in the past month and a half. Haven't been entirely clean, though--I continue to drink socially. Recently, I realized my lack of self control did indeed extend into alcohol use, despite the fact that alcohol was never really my drug of choice and was always infrequently consumed. Decided to quit drinking since I quit everything else already. So while I work out these kinks with my therapist, I have to ask...

What the fuck do people in recovery do on dates? 

Getting a drink, but not necessarily to get drunk, was always my go-to activity when I'd ask a girl out. 

This past week I met a girl at a coffee shop and we exchanged numbers, I just asked to meet up for a drink on X day at Y time and we met. I was a few minutes late, she'd already gotten a drink, offerred me one, and I just ordered a water. She was visibly off-put. Not a big deal since we're meeting again, but it was weird, yet so natural, for me to blurt that out when we first met. 

I'm casually seeing some other girls now, none of whom are drug users, but are all social drinkers. At dinners, I feel weird not ordering a bottle of wine, or not ordering cocktails before or whiskeys and cognacs after; I feel like they're kind of expecting it or its customary...maybe my perspective is skewed. In retrospect, I also sort of view it as this social crutch that a lot of people use to lower inhibitions and make it less nerve-wracking on first dates. My anxiety is pretty well-medicated, so I don't really suffer from anything like that, but I just expect drinking as some natural course of action that makes it easier for people with those kinds of anxieties to cope and get to know the other person better without feeling closed up. 

After I build a strong rapport and trust with a girl and the topic arises, I may bring up some of my past indiscretions, but never to their fullest extend. 

The couple of times I've been upfront as someone ""in recovery"" after being asked why I didn't smoke pot with her or come over to drink, it's resulted in upfront rejection (a good thing in those cases) or barraging of questions, ""what is _____ like?"", and then hear them try to sympathize with me by telling about some relative or friend or cousin or someone they know who used to be a drug addict. The latter is sweet, but I don't need sympathy, and while there are some common characteristics, my story isn't ever the same as theirs, as is the case with everyone.

I don't want to date other people in recovery, in AA, etc since I generally disliked the social groups I found in those settings and I'm still carrying my own baggage. I've met some great girls, but I'm starting to run out of things to do besides going out to eat and drink, checking out art/museums, going for walks, etc. Dating now just seems so watered down and boring to me, I can't help but think they're feeling the same way (or will at some point.)

Sorry for the rant.

Those of us in recovery are the minority, but our ties are strong.  I've been sober for just a little over 5 years.  When I went to rehab they coined me a 'poly substance abuser.'

"High function Churchillian drunk who quit update
Hi! I made a post a few days ago that I was about to quit last weekend.

I did, and today marks a week. My doctor doped me on a cocktail of anti-anxiety meds and sedatives, and though I went to work and hung out with friends, I barely remember Sunday through Wednesday. I had to go through my sent emails at work to make sure I was sane... and I mostly was. I mean, I've been working drunk for several months, so it couldn't really get any worse.

Afterall, I have a reputation and strange and eccentric *already* from my drunken antics. Unfortunate thing: I'm not a belligerent or stupid drunk. I'm charming. I have a great drunk skill set. I put people at ease. I mean, at least superficially. My relationship with my wife is strained, and I'm not doing excellent work... in any case, quitting was odd because I didn't hit a particular bottom. My bottom was, I guess, feeling like shit and personal guilt about spending money, sucking at things, ruining my personal relationships.

Anyway. Fifth and a half every day or so. Went on antidepressants a year or so ago, and it really kicked my tolerance into overdrive. I'm 29, so I feel like my tolerance is me being a bit of an overachiever.

I met with a CD counselor yesterday. I called around a lot and finally found one I was comfortable with. These places can attract all sorts of different people. And of course, I *am* all sorts of different people, so I shouldn't judge, but I wanted somewhere I felt comfortable.

I start intensive outpatient this or next Monday. 9 hours a week split between 3 days after work, from 6-9 on M-W-Th. I have to also attend two support groups outside of it to maintain my eligibility.

I've never done anything like this before. I'm sure I'm not alone.

I still don't know how to be alone with myself or occupy my time. Organizing my sock drawer seems banal and pointless, but I know it's exactly the sort of thing that I haven't been doing because I've been a drunk.

I know that sounds stupid. But, the other day, I thought maybe I should do a project. A craft or make something. Then I realized my life was a project, and I should probably organize my damn sock drawer.

I don't know. Just wanted to give ya'll an update, and thanks to housegroovin for checking up on me and asking me to post one.

P.S.
I went to a movie last night and passed a blues club. For a minute (well, like 20) I seriously doubted I'd ever be able to enjoy jazz or blues again. The lack hazy numb feel of having a cocktail in my hand and grooving seemed like a breakup. It made me think all my wine knowledge was useless. All my cocktail knowledge was useless. My charm, my small talk, all my stupid skills I got... that I read in On The Road, that I associate with the American character and with my broken but strong identity. How can I write a poem without a bottle?

So I honestly didn’t believe people when they told me they have had “user dreams” in the past. I just thought that it was some form of outlet, and that is why they would talk about waking up from having a user dream.  

Well I just woke up from my first one. And I don’t even know what to think or say. At first I felt stuck in a loop of the only thing that I ever enjoyed that much. It was amazing and awful at the same time. 

Then I freaked the fuck out. Thinking I had completely threw my clean time away. I’m very grateful it was just a dream. I’ve worked my ass off to keep each one of my days sober. 

It’s like waking up from a nightmare you enjoyed?!  Does that make any fucking sense?? No,  I didn’t think so either. But not sure how else to describe it.

"My brother is in a downward spiral (crack)
So basically I'm in a situation where I honestly have no idea on what to do. I am a 21 year old student and my brother is a 28 year old aggressive drug addict who scares my mother to the point where she hasn't slept since he got out of jail a week ago.

My brother has been an addict for roughly around 5 or 6 years now. He has progressively been getting worse and worse over the years until last year where he reached a point of just pure insanity where he was smoking so much he was a completely different human, and really aggressive with my mother. My dad wasn't aware of his addiction (due to them not speaking) until about last year once. After years and years of me and my mother constantly trying to help him we had to give up, there was simply nothing we could do, luckily around that same time he had accumulated thousands of dollars worth of fines and was told to either pay them or spend 6 months in a minimum security jail. Naturally he had no money as he would spend every cent on crack, so he went crazy for the months leading up to his arrest getting even worse than he had been prior. Finally, life caught up with him and he was arrested. after no communication between the family and him for a month or two, he rang up one day crying to my mother promising that he had learned his lesson and understands now how fortunate he was for being so selfish to a loving family etc etc... 

After the long phone call we began visiting him in jail, trying to support him in getting sober and help him through the process. My dad who hadn't spoken to him in years went to the jail and gave him full support. Eventually there was a parole hearing and he asked if we could all write letters to the parole committee to help get him out and get his life back on track. Naturally we did so thinking that getting him away from the other inmates was his best shot at getting better. He was released 3 months early on parole. Literally four days after getting back he disappeared in the middle of the night and turned up the next day aggressive and not wanting to speak to anyone. He locked himself in his room and didn't come out for a few days. We obviously knew what he was doing but we didn't want to cause a scene. After he had finished his $500 worth of crack (a payment that the government gave him to help him get back on his feet), my dad had a long talk with him, basically telling him that for our mom's sake he will give him one more chance and that if he takes any drugs again he would be out on the street. For two weeks he appeared to be getting back on track once again, then my dad had to go away for a business meeting for a few days, literally 5 minutes after my dad left for the airport my brother went out again this time not coming back until my dad was a few hours away from the house, as soon my dad got back he told him to pack his shit and leave. He left and tried to come back a few nights later and saw all the locks were changed so he tried to break one, my dad got out and threatened to call the cops if he didn't leave that very second. Once again he left and we found out later that we was caught with narcotics in his system and was sent back to his jail to serve the rest of his time. 

This part is a really long story so I went get into the details for this next part but basically while he went back to finish his sentence I found out that he had been diagnosed with aids and that was why he started going absolutely ballistic with the drugs last year. My guess is that he is somewhat suicidal. Anyways that brings me to now, while he was in, he tried contacting my mother again as he knows shes always had a weak spot for him, she refused to even answer the phone. Eventually an ex-girlfriend of his (who has been trying to help him get sober the past few years as well) contacted us saying that he says he's sorry for all the pain his caused us and that he finishes his sentence in a week and that he'll be transferring to a rehab facility straight from the jail.  Now he completed his sentence last week and instantly stopped contacting his ex and has disappeared. Obviously he is not at that rehab facility, my mum is living in a complete hell, she can't sleep, she barely eats, she is just basically waiting for the phone call to say they found his dead body or for him to come to the house one day stoned out of his mind and fight me and my dad. I am so conflicted, on one hand I hate him more than anything on the other I've had countless dreams where I find his lifeless body overdosed and wake up crying. I don't know what to do, I know that he isn't treating his aids as the doctors have been desperately trying to contact him, but I also know that if I do offer him help I will just become an enabler and allow him to take drugs more easily. I don't even know what my question is, I guess I just want to know if what we are doing is right and whether or not we should do more. I feel as though it is my responsibility as my mum and dad are getting old and can't really do much in this situation",
"Depression in recovery
I have 3.5 years clean and I have ""done the work"" in NA/AA - meaning: three rounds of the steps, meetings, sponsoring women, service,  etc etc. About a year ago one of my best friends passed (OD) and I haven't been the same since. I'm worried that it triggered clinical depression, especially since it runs in my family. I've been feeling this way for a YEAR and only just recently did I actually look up depression symptoms and realize I need to go to the doctor. 
That's because up until recently, I just figured I wasn't being diligent enough about my program, surely it was something I was doing wrong. I still am afraid that is what some of my friends will say. But it's hard to work your program and go to meetings and shit when you don't even want to leave your fucking house. 
I guess this is the stigma people talk about. 
But fuck it... I need to do what's best for myself, and let a doctor help me figure this out. If people want to judge me, fuck em. ",
"What do I tell your young children?
I love an addict.

I am raising her young children.

For some reason, both children, 5 and 6, spewed an incredible amount of graphic, sad, mortifying memories tonight: Left in cars late at night when mommy and bf went away/ waking up to find rats on the wall and unable to get an adult to wake up to help/ how loud voices remind them of the ""boyfriend"" who yelled at them and beat them with a belt/ being very hungry and not being able to wake anyone up/ deciding to drink a bottle of benadryl to ""get mommy to pay attention.""

I'm in over my head. 

I just let them fall asleep in my bed,  reminded them how much I love their mother and how much she loves then, how even though she is sick from drugs, the most important thing to her is that they are safe, loved, happy, and learning and doing a lot of new and wonderful things.  

It's taken almost a year for these memories to come out. These are deep and peotected hurts. 

I would LOVE then to have a future relationship with their mom should she get sober. Do you have any advice as to how to best handle this? 

Any other advice as to best help the kids?",
"Drank some wine, was sober for 39 days.
I quit drinking, smoking and doing cocaine cold turkey on April 28, 2018.

Today I had a meeting with someone extremely influential in my desired field of profession. We were at his home and he offered white wine that his parents made. I knew I could have said no, but I felt it would have been disrespectful - that was probably my minds way of justifying the act of indulging.

I drank it.

I felt a buzz.

When I went to catch my train, I felt atrocious. I felt horrible. I nearly went forty days. I quit absolutely everything in one throw, and just like that I threw my sobriety down the drain. I'm ashamed and embarrassed. 

I'm going to be sober again no matter what. I'd like to be sober forever. If I went nearly 40 days, now I must go 80. I have to beat my own high score.

Feeling this bad makes me never want to do that again.",
"Today unfortunately is one of those days I'm ungrateful to be clean.
Its a bad day.i have 40 days behind me clean time and I've lashed out all day just to make an excuse to use...i embarrassed my bf verbally in the store and i have no idea why i thought that was a good idea.i do that every time i am enraged and every time i think I'm doing good ,its days like today where I'm ungrateful for everything .now i feel like absolute shit leaving him to finish off his day bad,and its made my urges worse.I'm hoping i keep hope to finish another day sober,and hoping for a better day tomorrow",
"Really f'n bored with AA/12-step recovery - Reluctant to Stop Going
Hello, 

Not sure this is the kind of thing allowed in this sub - I didn't want to post in an AA-orientated sub and have a bunch of militant AA-ers tell me off..

Anyway, here's the thing: 

I'm 5 1/2 years sober and LOVE being sober but I find that going to AA meetings is the worst part of my day. 

I get up, feel full of gratitude for another sober day, spend most of my days doing positive things and living a life better than anything I could have imagined when I was drinking and I'm HAPPY. 

Then I go to an AA meeting and feel bored and fed up and can't wait for it to end so I can go home. 

I'm not really good at hidng my feelings so people who know me can tell and come up to me at the end of the meeting to ask if I'm Ok and I ""yes, everything is good"" because I don't want to say ""Yes, I'm very happy with my life but I really hate being here and just want to leave. ""

There's nothing in particular about being there - it's not like I'm resentful of a person or an idea - there's just a million more fun and fulfilling things I'd rather be doing than being at a meeting. 

I tried going to other meetings, changing things up - but its the concept of being at a meeting I hate, not specific meetings. 

I feel like i should just leave AA once and for all, but the last time I did that six years ago I drank. 

Just frustrated, fed up with it - I feel like if I stop doing AA I'll stop having this great life - but honestly doing AA right now feels like a chore. 

TL;DR: Love being sober - hate going to AA. Changing meetings hasn't helped. want to leave - feel like I can't/shouldn't.

EDIT/UPDATE: 
Just wanted to say thank you for everybody's feedback. The general consensus seems to be that I'd benefit from putting work in - looking at what I can give back rather than what I can take. 

I don't know if I'll ever get the same level of spiritual fulfilment from within AA that I get from things outside of it, but I do know that I'm grateful to AA for directing me towards the life that I have now, and for that I certainly agree that I can give something back and -if I'm truthful- feel like I have a lot to give back both inside and outside of the fellowship. 

I'll put the extra work in and see how it goes :) ",
"Getting a sobriety tattoo on Tuesday
This will be my 5th tattoo but the most meaningful. I will be clean for 2 years in July and I hate myself for being the way that I was every day. I feel like I missed so much because I was so high all the time and my memory is such a blur.

I'm getting a sea turtle (because in Native American cultures it represents life) on the inside of my calf (so when I cross my legs, I can look at it all the time) with water below it (to symbolize) purity. The artist is working my husband's, daughter's, and son's first initial into the waves of the water. I'm so excited to have a permanent reminder on my body when times get hard. ",
"i have literally no idea how to make friends without drinking.
So I've been sober for a year and four months, I didn't go to a program because it conflicted with my own views (ie I don't believe that I'm powerless to my addiction). The staying sober part has honestly been really easy. But what I'm finding truly difficult is making friends. I moved from St. Louis to a small college town in Southern Illinois right before I quit drinking to be with my partner and she's great but like I'm desperately craving a friendship outside of her. I pretty much sit in my apartment every single night, playing video games and not committing to watching anything on Netflix, unless she's off work. And having her as my only support system is just as unfair to her as it is to me. I'll occasionally go with my coworkers who I used to drink with before I got sober to the bar but it doesn't take long for me to get sick of/annoyed with everyone being shitty drunk, so I just end up leaving. They pretty much don't even bother inviting me out anymore because they know I either won't come or I'll just leave within the hour. I have a ton of friends that I love and will always be there for me back in STL but I only get to see them once every few months. I don't do sports, and pretty much my only interests are playing music and that's a social thing that's just not really possible without meeting people. Half the reason I ever started drinking was because my social anxiety is so bad that I don't know how to talk to people.",
"Passive aggressive sponsee
I'm at a loss. 

I've been working with this sponsee for maybe a year. 

There's been multiple relapses but she keeps calling and doing the work (in a passive aggressive way).

But there's been a few occasions where she's said some pretty hurtful things. 

It's obvious she's coming from a very broken place and she's a master at what I think of as  victim isolation -  as in I push everyone away and then live in a world of 'poor me, I'm so alone, no one understands'. 

My trouble is  I'm not sure how to deal, I have a health condition that is exacerbated by stress and this is becoming stressful. It also means that I have limited energy later in the day, but that's the only time she seems to be able to call. 


I don't like to think of quitting on someone in pain - who is turning up, but I can't go on like this for much longer. It's taking up too much head space. 

There's a lot of control stuff coming up and that (to me) is the opposite of surrender. 


I've started al-anon meetings, in addition to speaking with other members and spoken with my sponsor. 


Update:  It's done, the relief is enormous. And I get some new fellowships out of the experience and learned a fucktonne about boundaries. ",
"Need help. 15-year member, my sponsor passed away last year, in a real bind.
If one of you out there - preferably 10+ year? - would PM me I'll share details. I don't really want to talk about this at any of the meetings I go to, as part of my situation requires me confiding some things that are more personal than I want most people to know ... but this could be the end of a relationship I'm in and I'd rather act than knee-jerk react, and I don't have time to find a therapist and schedule meetings, and get them up to speed, etc.

EDIT: Sleep meds starting to kick in, time to go. Please either reply here or PM me if you're willing to lend an ear.  I'll check back in the morning.",
"Does it really get better?
Hi 👋,  I’m 28 (M) and I’ve been addicted to Cocaine and Cathinone for two years. Long story short; I’ve tried to quit multiple times with fail, but now I’ve reached a point of no more! It’s only been a day and a few hours. So I need to know, does life really get better?? I’m lonely and I don’t have anything to live for. ",
"30 days sober, the story of my addiction
As of yesterday, I made it to 30 days sober. This is the longest amount of time I’ve had sober in years. I thought that I should share my story and how exactly my drug use just spiraled out of  control. 

So I started using drugs at the age of 17. My reason behind it was the fact that I wanted to fit in with my friends. They were all drinking and smoking weed and that lifestyle really appealed to me. Growing up I never felt like I fit in. I was bullied a lot and I always felt different. I was placed in special ed because of my learning disabilities. This caused me to seek out social acceptance in a group of friends who drank and used drugs. I got drunk for the first time back in November of 2014 and I blacked out my first time. Then around December of 2014, I tried weed for the first time and fell in love with it. A few months later I’m smoking weed everyday. 

So I started experiencing consequences for my drug use my senior year of highschool. Getting kicked off my football team, almost getting expelled from school, ruining relationships with my family due to lying and manipulation. I start experimenting with hard drugs my senior year. I tried shrooms and acid. 

So in June of 2016, a friend of mine committed suicide. At that point I really just wanted to numb myself so I tried coke for the first time. Started abusing pills, drinking a lot. I didn’t want to be sober cuz I thought reality sucked. The night before I went to college I was driving to a gang members house to buy coke and by the grace of god I didn’t get arrested. 

I start college in August of 2016 and I meet a friend who sold me prescription pills all the time. Specifically Xanax and opiates(Vicodin, morphine strips, Percocets). This becomes big for me and I start doing them almost on a daily basis. I do that for a few months then I stop and 

I get home for winter break and start stealing alcohol from stores. I got caught at a 711 and got banned there. The owner said if I ever show up there again he’ll call the cops on me. I also tried ecstasy for the first time. So I added that drug to the mix. 

I stopped abusing pills but I’m still doing acid, ecstasy, weed and  alcohol a lot. Eventually the pills come back, I found an old bottle of OxyContin in my medicine cabinet at home and I also found someone who sells Xanax so those drugs re entered my life. I took a lot of Xanax one night and my mom saw me and she flipped her shit. My parents wanted me to go to rehab, I said no. That was the last time I did Xanax, still did everything else but Xanax I cut out. 

Towards the end of the summer I was drinking everyday and my buddy’s girlfriend introduced me to vyvanse. I’ve done vyvanse and adderall before but I never really did them often until around August/September of 2017 when I started abusing vyvanse to do homework. Everyday I either smoked weed, drank or did vyvanse. I was constantly intoxicated and never sober. That went on for a few months until I went home from break and almost got sexually assaulted my someone I considered a close friend. This caused me to become suicidal. I was holding a knife to my neck considering killing myself. I didn’t because of how my friends suicide affected me. 

I wanted to stop drinking and using drugs really badly but I couldn’t. So on January 7, 2018, I called a buddy of mine and asked him to take me to an AA meeting. I then asked him to sponsor me. Currently working the steps and my life has improved tremendously. I don’t wake up everyday wanting to kill myself cuz I’m so miserable and depressed. I feel less numb and more alive. I don’t have to worry about dying, going to jail or ruining relationships due to drug use. I feel free and I can live my life the way God intended me too. I’m happy to be free from the chains of addiction and I hope to one day help others who are struggling. ",
"Should I reset my days sober/without a drink?
Hey Redditors,

To cut along story short, over the last few years I've struggled with alcohol. What started out as a fun/rebellious thing to do with friends as a teen/late teen, became something I started to enjoy doing alone on weekdays. Staying up til the early hours with my headphones on; drinking, smoking a cigarette or 2 an hour, writing some raps and maybe smoking some hash. Though, this initial euphoria did begin to fade after the first year and i found myself becoming quite depressed then drinking more to offset the depression. This rabbit hole continued until June 22nd last year, when at a poker tournament somebody called me a drunk (I'd never met this person before, I was drinking my 2nd beer, it's at this moment I thought, oh shit.) I managed to make it 57 days sober til I relapsed, then had my dads wedding (+ the lead up to it, which involved getting drunk for 2 weeks pretty much every night.) I think I've got a problem. Anyway, I managed to quit for 98 days but on Sunday the kitchen of the new restaurant I work at (i'm a chef) catered to a huge party of people and to celebrate the head chef rallied up all the other chefs in a circle and to toast the night. I had no clue this was happening, I was downstairs vacuum packing all the mise en place I hadn't used. I hear my name being called loudly, run up to see what's what, the head chef hands me an opened beer, the whole chef brigade is silent, he gives a 10 second well done speech then precedes to raise his bottle as does everyone else (including me - I've just started working there, I'm at the bottom of the kitchen heir achy and i've already annoyed him enough during service so i don't interrupt and put the beer in my mouth.) Very swiftly after, he says, ""right back to work"" (with closing the kitchen.) I run back to the room I'm in, spit the beer down a sink and rinse my mouth. However the residual taste begins to kick off some cravings. 

My question is, today would be 101 days sober for me. Am i still sober?

Thank you",
"I remembered a random drug use memory today
Hey Everyone.  This is my first post on this sub.  I have 94 days clean from cocaine / alcohol / all drugs and had a completely random memory from when I was using today, I had completely forgotten about it.  I was in the back of a cab by myself going from one party to another, or from where I was at to home, not sure.  I remember wanting to take a bump but being really paranoid that the cab driver would see me / hear me.  I was basically sticking my head into my purse, trying to get my key out of the bag and into my nose in the complete darkness and kept messing up and spilling some into my purse, and freaking out that I was wasting it.  I don't know why I felt the need to share that, it was just a visceral memory that came out of nowhere today.  Another reminder of the person that I don't want to be anymore.. unable to go a 10 minute car ride without desperately needing a bump.   ",
"The folks here on this sub...
You are all so great, and I'd like to tell you how much I appreciate it.

I began my recovery without knowing where to turn for help or advice. I was nervous about telling anyone about my addiction, and that was incredibly difficult to do with the people in my personal life. Some were supportive, and others were cynical and judgemental.

Here though, I have felt *nothing but* love and support. Thanks to this sub and others like it, I have never felt like I'm alone. Posting here was a great way for me to start talking to other addicts who understand what I'm going through, while remaining completely anonymous. It really helped me overcome some of the shame I felt as an addict, as well as the anxiety of doing something I've never done before. 

As of today, I've gone to four NA meetings (yes, I will keep going back) and I'm in a much more comfortable place in my recovery. I'm also 18 days clean today. I really feel like I'm on my way to a better way of living.

So I want to thank every redditor in recovery who responds to my crap, and that of any other lost soul who comes here seeking advice or looking to vent. It makes a difference to us.",
"Stunned
I’ve been sober for 6 years.  My husband, who I thought was a hard drinker given sufficient reason to quit (me), had quit when I quit.  I found out that he’s been drinking vodka all these six years. He only drank beer before but switched to vodka when I got sober, for the lack of smell.  I caught him in a lie and he told me this when he apologized.  I’m stunned, but not really surprised it has come to this.  Damn alcohol.",
"How did everyone get past the “boredom” of living clean and sober?
I have been off of kratom for six weeks now after using it daily for four years (don’t be fooled by it being a plant - it’s no joke). 

I’m happy to be at the point where I don’t have to have any...but I’m wondering if I’ll ever get to the point where I don’t want any either. I can’t help but think that everything I do can be enhanced if I was to take some. 

It’s not that my temptation is that strong and overpowering, I just hate always thinking that everything I do could have been so much more enjoyable if I just had X (any substance). 

Does that ever go away? I want to be content just being. Will it always feel like something is missing? I wish I never experimented with substances because I know how good they can feel (aside from the whole ruining your life thing - I obviously don’t consider that when I’m thinking about it)",

"I fucked up yesterday and it ruined me
Disclaimer: I talk about AA in this post. I know some folks aren't down with AA, so there ya have it.
Ugh, I fucked up last night. Fucked up bad. I had just gotten out of jail about a month ago (3.5 months on a DUI), and sniffed some dope. My brother had to revive me with 3x narcan. He saved my life. I nodded out sitting indian style on the floor and woke up to be unable to move my legs. Apparently, I nodded so hard the doctors told me I got something called ""Saturday Night Palsy,"" and that it could take up to 3 months for all my movement and feeling to return. Awesome!

I just feel absolutely awful. I'm in AA. I have a sponsor, and went through the Steps. I just feel like a fake, like I never really will get this recovery thing. I've already told him that I relapsed, and we're gonna go through the Steps again together, this time using another method.

The thing that really fucks me up is this: I remember walking in to the rooms Dec. 19, 2016 and actually being willing enough to listen to suggestions. I managed to stay clean for 6 months, but then went to jail. While in jail, there is 0 recovery. I didn't get high in jail, but I might as well have: we just sat around and glorified our drug use all the time.

In other words, I was given the gift of desperation last December, but then had to go to jail. I wonder if I'll ever be able to get 6 months clean again.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I signed up for reddit just so I could make this post. I am so, so scared that I won't be able to stay clean again.",

Addictions, habits, thought patterns, choices, all have to do with the mind. Most the time we don't even realize what we're doing or any potential negative impacts.

"Finally moved into sober living
Drugs have cost me a lot these past few years and I just got kicked out of my parent's house yet again. So it was obviously time for a change. U made a very impulsive decision 3 or 4 months ago to quit my job, leave San Diego and Move back in with my parents leaving behind my entire NA support network. It was a pretty big mistake. I could not stay clean and that ultimately led to another downfall. So 2 days ago I decided to come back to San Diego and move into a sober living for the first time in a few years jnder the suggestions of my fellow addicts. Best move ever. It is going great so far as I have moved into a legit sober living house where there is no dope circulating around. There is great accountability here and everyone attends meetings. A ton of my friends were stoked that I came back and got into a sober living, as I have been very resistant to the idea for a long time. This is just what I needed. A safe place to really foster my recovery. I am so grateful for everything that has happened to get me here and I feel more confident than ever about getting clean. I thank god for this day and coordinating all of this. Tomorrow I go back to my old job in San Diego full time and am stoked! Things sre going well",
"Can you become addicted to marijuana?
So I have been clean from alcohol for about 2.5 years.  I recently turned to medical marijuana.  The problem is that I like being altered and I like the way it makes me feel.
