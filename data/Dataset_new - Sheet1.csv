"Do we know for sure that SSRI actually work for anyone for depression?
At least according to a whistleblower SSRI approval for depression in Europe started with fraud: 

* https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8170712-side-effects

This information is corroborated by history of their approval in USA. Eli Lilly knew that SSRI cause suicidal ideation and so on from day one:

* https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/30/weekend7.weekend1

We do know that FDA approval process requires several clinical trials to be successful, but it doesn't limit number of attempted trials. We also know that publication bias in sponsored trials is such that half of them simply aren't published. And we also know that even in trials sponsored and designed by pharmaceutical companies SSRI are hard to distinguish from placebo. Even though those trials mostly qualify as low quality evidence with high risk of bias.

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24329178
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199864
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172306/

We do know that SSRI with short half-life cause immediate suicidality in children and teens. Actually it might be true even for older people, just not proven well enough. And we do know that knowing that never stopped manufacturers from faking trials. Also it's very probable that many trials are made similarly to this one, even though they aren't faked that obviously:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_329

We also know that SSRI might cause cell death, and if that's true than it'd explain increase in BDNF. It'd mean that SSRI don't increase it, but damage something else. Increase in BDNF is a compensatory response by the body.

* https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/137/2/404/1675598/Sertraline-an-Antidepressant-Induces-Apoptosis-in
* http://www.jbc.org/content/288/8/5682.full

We also have experience with SSRI ourselves. From my experience, several people I know became worse on them, some attempted suicide while they didn't try it before. I thought it was an exception, but now I think that it might be the rule.

**My question is, given what I've said above do we have any solid evidence, without high risk of bias, that SSRI for depression actually work better than placebo? At least in cases of most serious depression?**"

"Hey DrugNerds! I want to give you all of the papers you dont have access to.
I am a student at a major university in the USA.  I have online access to many journals and databases.  This weekend I thought that I would give back to the DrugNerds community by taking requests for acedemic papers.  If the request is found it will be uploaded to a drop box I will set up.



To make a request please make a comment with the basic information of the paper you are looking for and I will see if I can find it this weekend.

"Calling All Drug Nerds! I am attempting to create a Wikipedia master list of receptor affinities values involving drugs. I would appreciate your help.
Well, I have been doing a lot of personal reserch involving the structure activity relationship of drugs.  I spend way too much time looking up affinities of substances and cross checking them.  I think it could be beneficial to the community to compile these known values in a unified and organized manner.  With that being said, I propose that we as a community collectively contribute to a Wikipedia article that could serve as a 'master list'  of all known affinity values for drugs of all categories.  Most of this could be done by importing content that is already present such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Releasing_agent#Release_affinities_of_selected_compounds) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine#Pharmacology), but I would also like to add external content such as [this](http://s249.photobucket.com/user/antec6/media/stimtable.png.html).  With your help we could make this a reference to be used for professional and amateur researchers a like. 



So,  I will be making comments on this thread to act as various topics of discussion.  These will include titles for the page and categories of organization. "

"I put together a big list of peer-reviewed articles on recreational MDMA use. [x-posted to /r/MDMA]
I'm a [graduate student](https://uwestern.academia.edu/HilaryAgro) who's doing my research on recreational MDMA use in Ontario, Canada. (Recruiting study participants now actually!) I put together this partial list from my literature review. Most of these articles are from disciplines in the social sciences (anthropology, sociology, psychology etc.) as I myself am a medical anthropologist, but there are a few bio/chem/psychiatry articles as well. They deal with the lived experiences of users, patterns of use, risk perceptions, harm reduction, associated cultures etc. of MDMA users. Methods are usually surveys, interviews and ethnographic research. 

If you have any questions, want to know more about my own research, need access to a PDF, or are curious about a particular topic and want me to point out which articles you might enjoy, ask away!

PS. [Here is an open Google doc of this list]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ql9alb05mv10Yq1st6RbUg4RQ154C9UWS3L2yO1i9TU/edit?usp=sharing) with Reddit formatting, if anyone wants to help me link more articles to their online PDFs it would be super helpful! It's quite time consuming to do all by myself, but ~~some are missing DOIs and~~ the list would look cleaner if the links were embedded into the article titles. Edit: Big thanks to /u/shrillthrill for filling out the PDF links!

**A few notes:**

* I put stars in front of some articles I think are particularly good. 
* As you can probably tell, Geoffrey Hunt is my favourite researcher. Lindquist's research is also absolutely *fascinating*, he looks at MDMA use by migrant workers and sex workers in Indonesia – some really unexpected stuff. Rosenbaum 2002 is a great overview of the history, politics, and media manipulation of Ecstasy, and the ways in which media and government reaction compromise harm reduction and safety.
* Recreational MDMA use research is heavily biased towards rave contexts for a number of obvious reasons; I would have aimed my own research more towards at-home use to examine the differences but it wasn't feasible for my ethics process this time around.
* Researchers love to use the term 'ecstasy', which most of us have discarded. In a way it's useful, however, when more than half of the pills that your average festival-goer is taking are not actually MDMA, but whatever cocktail of similar chemicals they end up with from a day-of dealer... Actually, Hayner (2002) talks about this.

Since psilocybin is a strong 5ht2a agonist (I believe), and 5ht2a agonism seems to strongly suppress TNF induced inflammation (which is a key target of many drugs attempting to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis), then does it follow that perhaps something like microdosing psilocybin can be seen as a potential treatment for these diseases?

The Lycæum was host to many of the first drug sites on the internet, and we've been putting effort into restoring them to their former states.  You can see a list of what we've unearthed on our home page.

The Lycæum was born from the infamous Visionary Plants List (VPL), a now-retired Internet mailing list that was subscribed to by many people with a common interest in the entheogenic experience. We officially opened our doors on June 22, 1996, as a place where people from all around the world could freely exchange and research information regarding visionary plants, fungi, and chemicals.  This was an extraordinary thing in its time.  Since then, we have had millions of visitors and have helped create the culture alive online today.  

Over the years The Lycæum has fallen to disuse to do an antiquated system (LEDA), lack of volunteers and absence of funding.  We're trying now to bring the Lycaeum out of its legendary status and back into use by transforming LEDA into the internet's centralized drug wiki.  We've basically forked all drug data on wikipedia, modified it, and added huge amounts of information to it.  We're currently adding trip reports, images, research, documents, synthesis and extraction and other data to the corresponding pages.  Do you have knowledge to share? Join us in expanding our knowledge base! 

http://www.lycaeum.org/

Our site has been around without disruption for almost 20 years, so any effort put into this project will not be wasted.  You can reach us on the Lycaeum Forums http://lycaeum.org/forum or on #visionary on lycaeum.org's IRC (port 6667).


I hope the moderators will forgive this blatant spamming!

"Alcosynth, Dr.David Nutt's Synthetic Alcohol Contains an Undisclosed Patented Benzodiazepine Derivative As Its Active Ingredient.
David N or more commonly known on the internet as the person whos going to replace alcohol with a safer version called alcosynth, and claimed to replace alcohol completely by 2050. I think he owns nearly 100 patents on various low-dependence and abuse-potential anxiolytics of the benzodiazepine class, potentially most of them are new or at least currently undisclosed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nutt#Alcosynth

to be honest pretty interesting stuff, he might have finally discovered a benzodiazepine molecule with extremely low dependency. In the last decade a lot of progress has been made toward understanding benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence and it seems GABAA1's ligand agonism was one of the root problems to causing tolerance.

Or he coudlve found a way where another benzodiazepine inverse agonist can prevent the tolerance building mechanism, any other guesses?

MEAI is also mentioned, i am sure some of you guys here cant wait to try his stuff out hahahha."

"A couple ideas for this sub
Let me start out by saying that I love this sub. It always has tons of interesting articles most of which help me with my own research. That being said, I have two ideas which might make it even better.

1. Drugnerds AMA. The science AMAs are usually pretty interesting but rarely do they have researchers working with MDMA, cocaine, benzos, etc. that r/drugnerds subscribers are interested in. There are definitely a wealth of PhDs on this site and I feel like maybe a once a month AMA would be possible? Not sure of the logistics but I think it would be cool and also productive since this is a smaller subreddit.

2. A weekly paper request sticky thread. This would be a place for people to come and ask if there are papers showing drug x causes y. This would allow this sub to use each others knowledge of the literature to find good papers rather than sifting through pubmed for an hour or two. 

Just some thoughts. Let me know what y'all think or if you have any other ideas."

HCl gassing in xylene ketone cannot form crystals. The xylene gets cloudy, but nothing precipitates. I've ran the reaction two separate times from start to finish, the first time I got nothing but sludge; second time, sugar-like crystals formed but dissipated into sludge again. What am I doing wrong? 

The ketone has been checked prior to use. All of the necessary distillations came over within the correct temp range (from the directions using a vacuum.) The only issue I've rang into is my xylene prior to gassing seems to be ""too clean,"" meaning the solution is clear rather than cloudy like the directions say it should be.

"Help MAPS Complete Research into MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy as a Treatment for Veterans with PTSD
Hey /r/drugnerds! We are the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)](http://maps.org), and we need your help showing the world how important psychedelic research is.

We have just launched a **[massive fundraising campaign on Indiegogo](http://mdmaptsd.org/healingtrauma)** in an effort to raise money for our study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for veterans, firefighters, police offers, and first responders suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). **This study is part of an international research program to develop MDMA-assisted psychotherapy into a prescription treatment for PTSD.** 

* [Contribute to the study](http://mdmaptsd.org/healingtrauma)
* [Watch the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWIc4vRFoYY)
* [Share the campaign](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Figg.me%2Fp%2Fhealing-trauma-in-veterans-with-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy%2Fa1e3%2F5021950)

**We need your help to complete this study and spread awareness about the need for more effective treatments for PTSD.** Every gift moves us closer to completing the vital research needed to make MDMA-assisted psychotherapy a safe and legal treatment option for people suffering from PTSD. 


MAPS' government-approved research shows that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be an effective treatment for people who do not respond to traditional therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our ongoing study in U.S. military veterans, firefighters, and police officers is halfway complete, and early results are promising.


We are seeking to raise $50,000 through this campaign to enable a wider group of people to participate in and raise awareness about this historic study, which will motivate the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Administration to get more involved.


**In a recently completed study, 83% of subjects receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer qualified for PTSD.** These subjects had suffered from PTSD for an average of 19 years. A long-term follow-up of subjects receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy revealed that **overall benefits were maintained on average for 3½ years or more.**


By making a gift and sharing this campaign, you're helping raise awareness for PTSD while providing vital funding for research that is transforming lives.


**If you know a veteran, someone suffering from trauma, or someone interested in the legitimization of MDMA as a therapeutic tool, please share this campaign with them and encourage them to contribute: http://mdmaptsd.org/healingtrauma**"
"Psychiatrist story I feel like only this sub will appreciate
To preface: I am 30 years old and went back to school to complete my BS in Biology last fall. I work full time, and about 4 months ago I decided I wanted some chemical enhancement. I was on Concerta when I was a teenager, so I booked a psych appointment and was honest that my ADD is mild at best but stimulants help me and I want them. Doctor was a bit disinterested/skeptical but I clearly knew my pharmacology and thus left with a scrip for 30mg Vyvanse.

Two months later we upped it to 40mg and things were okay for a month again, but the effects wear off within about 3 hours now. Obviously tolerance is forming despite my breaks on the weekends, so I requested an IR booster for the afternoons. The PA was cool with it but went to ask the doc and you would have thought I asked to switch to meth or something. Dude comes in to the office, asks me to get on the scale, says I'm losing weight (I've literally lost about 5 pounds, I'm 6'4"" 210lbs, low BF%) and ultimately tells me ""This office does NOT prescribe IR Adderall"". He tells me he wants to switch me to a drug called Mydayis and writes me a scrip for that. Claims it will serve the same purpose. I reluctantly agree to try it.

Mydayis is a new-ish amphetamine formulation. It's 3:1 dextro to levo just like Adderall, but it is *delayed* release instead of extended release. It is essentially designed to work like three IR pills within one pill, the first dose at T+0, the second T+4 hours or so, the third T+7-8 hours. It's also about $20 a pill and my insurance said ""fuck you, no one takes that"". I also could not find it at any pharmacies in town. I called the doc back and said ""Nowhere has this and insurance won't cover it, just give me the Vyvanse refill until I can figure out what I want to do."" He does so.

So at next appointment I came prepared with even more research and what I thought was a good point. I tell the PA ""Honestly I understand policy, but if the doctor says he won't prescribe me an IR booster and yet wants to prescribe me Mydayis, to me that says he doesn't trust me not to abuse the medication."" She expresses slight disagreement but I follow with ""Mydayis is *delayed* release, meaning it serves the same function as three IR pills. That means he agrees with the concept of a booster but will not prescribe one by policy. He is essentially saying 'I want to put you on IR Adderall but I don't trust you to dose it properly.'"" She resigns to this truth and apologizes.

I say essentially ""Look, I'm not trying to appear drug-seeking or denigrate your medical expertise, but there are plenty of people who take Vyvanse with some sort of IR amphetamine booster later in the day at doses FAR higher than I am on. If this office won't treat me in keeping with the current medical consensus as to what's safe then I will just take my final 40mg Vyvanse scrip today and find a new doctor."" She is a reasonable lady, apologizes again for the policy and says ""Let me see what I can do."" 

*It is important to note at this point that I have not requested an  Adderall booster by name a single time. The doctor was the one who made a big deal about Adderall. In fact, I really wanted Dexedrine since I prefer dextroamphetamine and Vyvanse is pure dextro as well.*
 
So the PA comes back in with the doctor. He's like ""Okay look, we don't prescribe IR Adderall and I am not breaking that policy for you. If you want to find another doctor I understand, but the best I can offer you as far as a booster is either of these two drugs (slides me a pamphlet for Evekeo and Zenzedi). These are the only boosters we offer.""

I literally smirk and then cannot stop myself from laughing in their faces. I think they thought I was mad, and while I was a little annoyed, it was not for the reason they thought. I can't resist and say ""No offense, but do you know what the formulations of these are?""

Doctor says ""Yes, they are immediate release amphetamine. The Evekeo has two kinds and the Zenzedi is just dextroamphetamine."" 

I'm like ""Yeah, I know. I'll take the Zenzedi, I actually can't believe I had to threaten to find a new doctor for you to offer this to me.""

PA is staring at the floor and doc is looking confused but starts to write the scrip. I say ""I just want to be clear - we all know that Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, right?"" They all nod like *what's your point?*

""So if you're prescribing me 100% dextro with no issue, and you offered me a racemic mix without issue, the policy against Adderall actually has nothing whatsoever to do with the contents of the pill and everything to do with the name 'Adderall"", right?""

PA smirks but does not respond, doctor says ""We simply do not prescribe that formulation. By Policy."" I laugh, take the scrip, say thank you, I wanted dexedrine the whole time anyway.

I just thought this was a rather hilarious example of how even medical professionals who know better can fall victim to stigmas surrounding certain drugs and try to distance themselves from them. It's a bit sad, but also a bit understandable I guess. 

Either way, I got my dexedrine so now I'm crushing work and writing 1k word reddit posts in ten minutes for fun so it's ultimately fine, just saying.

"What This Sub Should Be More Focused On (?)
First, a name like ""psychotropicdrugnerds"" would describe this sub much more accurately, nearly every post is directly neuro related or almost so. 


I can't be the only one tired of posts with links extolling psychedelics (cause we're fighting the man right?) next to posts warning you again how incredibly dangerous adding that N-methyl group to amphetamine is (ok, the man won there, I just don't want to see bugs crawling under my skin like in that one movie). 


I thought maybe we could try suppressing our biases, to stop caring what B.S. the gov't/media is spewing (and stop pretending we don't). Maybe stop treating published research as automatically fact (and ""anecdotal"" info as automatically bullshit), but to have some skepticism of both


*Ok that's nice but what ""focuses"" are you sugggesting?* 


How about incorporating a little bit more of the non-CNS related pharmacology? How about compiling certain facts that **EVERY** person should know, regardless if they give a damn about drugs (potency vs. efficacy would be a place to start). Why not strive to get more pharmac(ists)ologists/neuroscientists/doctors/biologists etc to contribute or do AMAs (with honest answers/comments). 


To be a ""nerd"" you just have to have an interest in or knowledge of something, it isn't a strictly defined term. A greater dialogue between the student/aspirational ""nerds"" and the professional ""nerds"" would be nice. No, I don't want flairs advertising this, I'd rather people read the comment and take what's said at its own merit. 


Really I'd just like a version of r/drugs that is about as least like r/drugs as can be, save the topic. This sub can be that.

"PSA: please be aware of the dosages used in the studies you link - it really does make or break the study (re: mega-dosing).
Let me start off by saying that this isn't a problem I have with /r/drugnerds in the slightest. You guys are great. Mainly, this is a problem I've been noticing within the scientific community when it comes to studies about any substance - be it a Schedule 1 Substance in the US, a mineral supplement, or even plant matter: it has to do with the fact that many of the ""groundbreaking"" studies coming out or being discussed are using ""mega-dose"" ranges in their dosages when applied to the rat models they use. 

For example: the infamous **monkey-cannabis study**, funded by the DEA, is probably the most succinct example, but is not the only one.

> Link to a tear-down: http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/hemp/prohibition/no-clothes.html

>Link to the study: (I can't find it through lots of Google-fu, but it's pretty infamous at this point)

>In the report, Heath concluded that Rhesus monkeys, smoking the equivalent of only 30 joints a day, began to atrophy and die after 90 days [that's 2700 joints, or an average of 1.25 doobies per hour 24 hours a day, for 90 days!] 

> Rhesus monkeys were strapped into a chair and then strapped into gas masks and given the equivalent of 63 ... joints in ""five minutes, thru the gas masks"" losing no smoke.

i.e: the monkeys died due to intentional asphyxiation by the scientists.

Another example: a study posted to /r/drugnerds recently about the dangers of **5-HTP supplementation**, that I actually commented on.

> Link to the study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415362/?report=classic

>5-HTP daily dosing values > 0 to 2,400 mg per day.

>l-tyrosine daily dosing values > 0 to 14,000 mg per day.

>l-dopa daily dosing values > 0 to 2,100 mg per day.

As I mentioned in the other thread, the numbers they're basing these ""troubling findings"" on are roughly 24 tablets of your standard 5-HTP dose (100mg) per day, or 28 tablets of your standard L-Tyrosine dose (500mg). Another mega-dose scenario which doesn't occur ""in the field"" at all, ever.

Another one: **aloe vera has recently been ""found to cause cancer.""** The problem? You guessed it.

>Link to the study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22968693

>Link to the tear-down: http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Research/Experts-cool-concerns-over-FDA-Aloe-vera-carcinogenicity-study

>“Some of these products averaged 6300 ppm of aloin A and are completely different than many aloe vera juice products on the market that limit aloin to less than 5 ppm,” he said. “Additionally, these preparations were administered every day for 2 years.”

**Gingko biloba**, another casualty.

>Link to the study: http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/LT_rpts/TR578_508.pdf

>Link to the tear-down: http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/new-doubts-about-ginkgo-biloba/?_r=0

>In the new ginkgo study, mice were given up to 2,000 milligrams of extract per kilogram of body weight, or just over 900 milligrams per pound of body weight, five times a week. Doses sold for human consumption range from 30 to 120 milligrams, regardless of body size.

For the average human male weighing 200 lbs/90kg: 2000mg * 90kg = 180,000mg, or 1.8kg per day. Typical doses of ginkgo biloba are 30mg to 120mg per twice, twice a day, for a maximum of 240mg if taken as directed. ... yeah.

You really, really, really need to pay attention to the dosages in the studies you read. Often in articles online, especially from the mainstream media, they'll have some big headline like ""DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE CAUSES INSTANT DEATH"" as the big attention-grabbing title, but then completely fail to list the dosages used in the study, or even link to the study in question. (Good luck finding an open-access version of the studies, too, in most cases, or even the name of the damned scientists who did it.)

So, just a friendly reminder: if a new study comes out that completely flips conventional wisdom on its head, be skeptical and ask yourself, ""what exactly are they doing to get this radically different result?"" "

"Drugs that can cure fear - a discussion on propranolol (and other potential candidates)
**This isn't me asking for medical advice**, I already saw my doctor yesterday for exactly that; rather I am just interested in the subject and think it warrants a discussion.

Some background on why I'm thinking of all this:

So, I fucking hate experiencing turbulence while on airplanes. It's irrational, and it never used to be a problem for me, but now it is, and it sucks, and I hate it. Tingly hands and feet, sweaty palms, pounding pulse, the typical panic response. I went the alprazolam (xanax) route at first, but noticed it just made my anxiety worse in the long run, and found literature supporting my experience: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9299803

Naturally, now I want to stay away from xanax, or any benzos for that matter, as there seems to be reason to believe they interfere with ""retraining"" your amygdala to not act irrationally in such situations.

I then came across this paper, which involves using **propranolol to aid in fear extinction**: http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223%2815%2900313-3/abstract?showall=true=

I knew that propranolol is often used by performers to combat stage fright, but this was the first I was seeing of propranolol being used to eliminate an actual phobia. It appears that propranolol inhibits the amygdala and fast-tracks the disruption of memory reconsolidation in phobia exposure therapy. Which is honestly *amazing*. Because of this info I decided to give Inderal (propranolol) a try for my irrational anxiety and fear surrounding turbulence.

Lucky me, my doctor was on board with this idea, and I now have enough propranolol and diazepam (as a plan B if the propranolol doesn't work as expected) for my trip, and to experiment with. Amusingly enough, it seems diazepam and propranolol are an excellent anxiolytic combo: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7037093

My trip isn't for a month so no idea if it'll work or not, but google-retrieved anecdotes seem promising. Fingers crossed for me...

Anyway... for similar beta blockers (metoprolol for example), I couldn't find any data supporting *their* use in treating phobias/anxiety... all the results about ""beta blockers and anxiety"" pertain to our friend propranolol. So what might it be about propranolol that makes it so unique in aiding to extinguish fear? Inhibition of norepinephrine is mentioned, yet metoprolol, which doesn't appear to be anxiolytic in the way propranolol is, also appears to have inhibitory effects with regard to norepinephrine...

Is propranolol really unique in this sense, or am I missing something here? Are other beta blockers used as successfully as propranolol for anxiety (every result for ""beta blocker for anxiety"" involves propranolol), or does propranolol really have something unique about its pharmacology? I did see mention that propranolol may antagonize 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors (https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-996592 yes I pulled this link from wikipedia, lol). There's also this study on cats involving propranolol, vagal nerve stimulation, and plasma serotonin concentration https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/44426 suggesting that propranolol might have an inhibitory effect on serotonin release in some parts of the body, at least in cats...

If these pieces can all be put together, eliminating fear with a pill, and knowing how it's done, is honestly a remarkable thing."

"Shulgin's 1975 predictions and the present and future of designer drugs.
[This](http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/shulgin.futuredrugs.html) article from 1975 is really interesting. It's Shulgin's predictions of what the future of designer drug use will be. Some of his predictions are prescient, some of them just haven't happened, and I think I might be interesting to discuss why, as well as what he got right and wrong.

Just a couple quick observations to kick things off:

* He predicts that it is economically inevitable that heroin is going to be replaced by some synthetic opioid as the gold-standard opiate drug of abuse. I don't think this has really happened: perhaps because heroin production remains economically viable, perhaps because no other opioid rivals it for recreational value, I don't know.

* He spends a decent amount of the article discussing the potential for barbiturate analogues to massively take off, due to the ease of modifying the compounds to escape being classed as deriratives of bartituric acid. He seems to expect this to be a major future issue, whereas I don't think the RC market has seen a single barbiturate analogue. Why is this? Simply because they've been eclipsed by benzodiazepines?

* He proposes that there is 'an unlimited variety of future abusable drugs' related to methaqualone. Again, not really happened, there's a couple RC methaqualone analogues but I think they're rather unpopular and definitely haven't taken off. Again, why?

Anyway, that's just a couple of things to kick things off, there's plenty more in there that I think are worth talking about.

For all you autodidacts, aspiring neuroscientists/pharmacologists, or those needing a review - I've been producing powerpoints on various subjects in neurobiology for my own education for a while now, and I have generally tried to share them by producing an ""intermediate"" version for myself, and a ""beginner"" version for the casual student.
 
 
I am a firm believer in the notion that the ability to communicate understanding of a subject to the layperson is the truest indicator of actual knowledge, and I greatly enjoy being asked questions that I am forced to look up the answers to. I find this increases my retention.

"I have recently launched an entirely new, fully functional wiki on the topic of phenomenological psychonautics and would seriously appreciate the scientific opinions and advice of r/drugnerds
www.encyclopediapsychonautica.org

Hey there guys, A little information - I have been working on this website itself for the past few months, it contains a comprehensive breakdown of the hallucinogenic experience and complete subjective effect descriptions for a wide variety of different substances among a huge catalogue of information. This has been done from a purely phenomenological perspective that does not depend on analogy, metaphors or mysticism to convey its definitions. The effects themselves are documented, organized and mapped out through the use of formal literary descriptions, terminologies and definitions which are organized into the separate articles below,

* [Psychedelics \(visual effects\)](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics)
* [Psychedelics cognitive effects](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Cognitive_effects_-_Psychedelics)
* [Psychedelics auditory effects](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Auditory_effects_-_Psychedelics)
* [Psychedelics physical effects](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Physical_effects_-_Psychedelics)
* [Dissociatives subjective effects](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Dissociatives#Subjective_effects)
* [Deliriants subjective effects](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Deliriants#Subjective_effects)
* [Hallucinogen \(subjective effects index\)](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Potential_subjective_effects_index)
* [Specific substances](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=Portal:Specific_Substances)

We have put a huge amount of effort into ensuring that the descriptions are as accurate and unbiased as possible but the reason I am here is to ask for /r/drugnerds unbiased advice on the possibility (if there even is one) of progressing a field such as phenomenological psychonautics into a legitimate field of science across the long term future. At the moment I am 100% aware that their may well be limitations in our methodologies due to the very nature of documenting a ""subjective experience"" in a controlled manner but have many plans for the future that will hopefully diminish this factor. For example the development of an automated piece of software which can generate statistically accurate descriptions of any specific substance from LSD to salvia through the use of a complex online questionnaire system is currently in the works. We intend to integrate this into the wiki and have already made a working but manual prototype based upon the subjective effect index linked above.

Any advice on our limitations and overcoming them would be extremely appreciated as I personally feel that the /r/drugnerds community can offer it in more ways than any of the other currently popular drug subreddits.

The website itself contains huge amounts of information beyond subjective effect breakdowns with 162 articles at launch and is an entirely community driven, continuously self progressing project. We are currently looking to expand our numbers and would love to collaborate with as much of the online community as possible. :)

Our long term goal of establishing psychonautics as a legitimate field of science is far from complete but we feel that we have produced an excellent starting point and are making significant progress.

"Let's talk about beta-substituted phenethyamines!
We haven't done a rational drug design post in a while, and they're always a lot of fun. I've got a great topic in mind for this one!

[Beta-substituted phenethylamines.](http://i.imgur.com/2zxN7qe.png)

(The beta carbon is the one that I've circled here.)

Now, you're all likely familiar with a major family of beta-substituted PEAs, the beta-ketones.  [Cathinone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathinone) is beta-ketone [amphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine). [MDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA) becomes [MDMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylone) (methylone). [4-MMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Methylmethamphetamine) becomes [4-MMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephedrone) (mephedrone). All amphetamines have a corresponding beta-ketone analogue.

Plenty of cathinones are useful drugs, both for medical and recreational purposes. But why limit ourselves? There's lots of other beta-substitutions that can be made (and some that have been).

Compare these three drugs:

[Methamphetamine](http://i.imgur.com/5Si0k8O.png)

[Methcathinone](http://i.imgur.com/9GGUQIm.png)

[N,α,β-methyl amphetamine](http://i.imgur.com/zf90Lw9.png)

This is methamphetamine with a beta-methyl substituent. AFAIK, it's never been made. Now, what effects would this have? We can look at some similar drugs that have been made for some clues.

The beta-methyl version of [phentermine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phentermine) has been made before, and it's called [pentorex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentorex). Shows similar but somewhat reduced potency compared to its parent compound.

There is beta-methyl amphetamine, [2-Phenyl-3-aminobutane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Phenyl-3-aminobutane), which was claimed in the patent to be weaker than amphetamine, but there are no actual studies backing this up.

More promising is [BMPEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Methylphenethylamine), the beta-methyl analogue of phenethylamine. You may have heard of it in the news last year when the FDA discovered it in some dietary supplements and promptly banned it. It's much stronger than its parent compound, and is roughly a third as potent as amphetamine.

So, what can we draw from this? It's likely that, like beta-ketones, beta-methyl analogues will show somewhat reduced potency as releasers. They may change the ratio of DA/NE/5-HT. N,α,β-methyl amphetamine would most likely be around half the strength of methamphetamine, and may have a greater amount of DA/NE compared to 5-HT.

I'd bet money that [beta-methyl MDMA](http://i.imgur.com/Grngt17.png) would be a recreational SRA that's on par with methylone.

But why limit ourselves to ketones and methyls? You can also do halogen substitutions on the beta carbon.

The beta-fluro analogues of 2-FA and 2-FMA have been made (they look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZywVf8i.png)). They were MORE potent than the parent compounds, and were the closest compounds to d-amphetamine that they tested.

Underground chemists have synthed beta-fluro amphetamine and beta-fluro methamphetamine, and found them to be highly similar to their parent compounds.

I'd bet a LOT of money that [beta-fluro MDMA](http://i.imgur.com/BzOnpjQ.png) would be functionally identical to MDMA, while maybe being slightly more potent.

In summary, I'm of the belief that beta-methyls would be similar in effects to beta-ketones, and you could make an analogue of any cathinone. I'm also of the belief that beta-fluros will end up being extremely similar to their β-desfluro counterparts. All of these chemicals would be legal worldwide (with the exception of beta-methyl amphetamine, which would be considered a positional isomer of methamphetamine and is explicitly illegal in many countries.)

This has been cobbled together from posts on Bluelight, Wet Dreams, Science Madness, and some underground forums that I won't mention. I'm enamored with the possibilities of beta-substitutions. Anyone have any further information or links? Are you aware of any chemicals of this style that I missed? Got ideas for good analogues? (Beta-methyl 4-MMA, beta-fluro MDA/MDMA, and beta-fluro 4-FA would all likely be big winners.)"

"Marijuana ""copies"" the effect of the last drug I took
I've had this happen before a couple times. It's happened to me with MDMA, alcohol, and possibly salvia. Basically, I would do the aforementioned drug one day, and the next day I would smoke weed, and the weed high would feel more like that drug than a regular weed high. 

In fact one time with MDMA, the actual roll wasn't even that good, and the effect I got from smoking weed the day after rolling was actually stronger than the roll itself. Anyone else experience this? What would be the neurological mechanisms behind this?

edit: The effect that I'm talking about is actually only a day after effect, like the next time I smoke weed  the weed high will have returned to normal. However, I don't think we should discount what you guys are posting about psychedelics inducing lasting changes in the weed high, however. In fact it may work by the same mechanism. I haven't done any psychedelic other than salvia so I do not have enough experience to comment on their effects on weed."

"The antipsychotic Aripiprazole increases methamphetamine's stimulant and euphoric effects
So were looking at a very unique drug. Aripiprazole (Abilify) is a partial dopamine agonist antipsychotic. There is no other drug like this besides its cousin brexpiprazole. What makes it so unique is that its a partial dopamine agonist. All other antipsychotics are just regular antagonists/inverse agonist of this receptor. It being a partial agonist makes it perform as an agonist when dopamine levels are low and an antagonist when dopamine is high, its essentially a stabilizer. 

Its important to establish that atypical/typical antipsychotics have no effects on amphetamine-induced dopamine release. 

> The data suggest that these atypical antipsychotic agents did not antagonize amphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release

"Lets talk about 3,4-Difluoromethamphetamine
MDMAs serotonergic activity primarily arises from the methylenedioxy group's hydrogen bonding to a site on SERT. I would assume 4-FA is also surprisingly sertogeneric compared to other amphetamines because of the electronegativity of the fluorine atom causing similar bonds at the same site.

Could adding another fluorine atom at the 3 position mimic MDMA's electronegativity of the methylenedioxy group better than just 4-FA? [The binding angle is 111 degrees in MDMA](https://books.google.com/books?id=5j2231xedBgC&lpg=PA339&ots=febK_217b-&dq=methylenedioxyphenyl%20binding%20angle&pg=PA339#v=onepage&q=methylenedioxyphenyl%20binding%20angle&f=false). The difloro bonding angles would probably be greater than 120 but probably not by much. The absence of any steric hinderance of the carbon probably will affect binding affinity also, in what direction I am not sure. My main concern would be that the addition of another fluorine would change the aromatic ring's electronegativity in such a way as to leave it more vulnerable to nucleophilic attack and possible neurotoxicity.

Another possibility is that MDMAs dioxy group is serotonergic at the 4 position and promotes DE and NA release at the 3 position. This would explain why 3-FA is more NE and DA dependent.

"Study claims that memantine is not neuroprotective, and not even NMDA-antagonist at low doses at which it's usually taken
People on the internet seem to like memantine a lot, especially for its supposedly neuroprotective properties. I had a hunch for some time now that there is no such thing as neuroprotection by substances which affect neurotransmission, and that neuroprotection achieved by interacting with neurotransmitters is almost certainly impossible due to homeostatic mechanism called oppositional tolerance. Physical changes will be always made by the brain make to compensate for what is, from its standpoint, interfering with normal function. Resulting changes in primary affected system and ""downstream"" (in reality, probably just closely linked) systems are hard to predict, and I'm most certain that they will not be benign.

Regardless of if I'm correct, I just found this study which I want to share with you. This study claims that memantine is neither neuroprotective, nor NDMA antagonist.  Here it is: **Donepezil markedly potentiates memantine neurotoxicity in the adult rat brain:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/ I've highlighted what seems to me most important.

I suggest reading this whole study, it's pretty interesting. Below I'll quote parts that I find most important as a sort of TL;DR, without trying to sensationalize. 

>Our findings appear to contradict reports in the published memantine literature that have consistently characterized this drug as having little or no potential for triggering neurotoxic reactions in either the adult rat or human CNS. In rats, it reportedly exerts a protective effect against hypoxic/ischemic neurodegeneration beginning at a dose of 20 mg/kg, and at this dose no neurotoxic side effects were described [5].

...

>How can our present findings be reconciled with prior reports describing memantine as a non-toxic agent in rats, and as a safe and beneficial therapy for AD and other neurological disorders? Regarding the previously reported rodent data, the contradiction may be more apparent than real. Chen et al. [5] reported that memantine did not produce a neurotoxic reaction at 20 mg/kg, but this is the highest dose they tested. We believe a more complete dose-response evaluation would have produced evidence for a neurotoxic reaction at all doses above 20 mg/kg, in which case equivocal findings at 20 mg/kg, the dose required for neuroprotection, does not attest to the safety of this agent as a neuroprotective drug. **As we have discussed previously [10], lack of evidence in earlier studies for memory and locomotor disturbances at neuroprotective doses, can be explained by features of the research design that were not optimal for detecting such adverse effects.** 

...

>It is fortunate that memantine, when administered to human AD patients, has been relatively free from adverse side effects, but we propose that the most logical explanation is that the dose of memantine being used in AD patients **may not create brain levels high enough to appreciably interact with NMDA receptors.**

...

>Thus, both animal and human data support the interpretation that the reason memantine does not produce intolerable side effects in human AD patients is that it is being used at doses that are well below the threshold for interacting with NMDA receptors. **Obviously, if this interpretation is correct, it is untenable to maintain that memantine arrests neurodegeneration in AD, or has any other beneficial effect in AD, by blocking NMDA receptors.**

...

>In summary, on the basis of the present findings and analysis of other relevant data, we consider it a possible misconception that memantine, by blocking NMDA receptors, arrests neurodegeneration and thereby confers a beneficial effect in AD. When memantine is administered to adult rats in a neuroprotective dose (i.e., a dose that effectively blocks NMDA receptors) typical NMDA antagonist type of neurotoxic side effects are readily demonstrable, despite the unique binding kinetics described for this agent in rat brain. Therefore, we propose that: **1) if the doses of memantine used in AD patients were neuroprotective by virtue of blocking NMDA receptors, typical NMDA antagonist type of side effects, including memory impairment, locomotor disturbances and psychotic reactions, would be encountered; 2) absence of such side effects may indicate that memantine, at these doses, does not block NMDA receptors; 3) this interpretation is more compelling than the unique binding kinetics interpretation for explaining memantine’s favorable safety profile in humans;** 4) the unique binding kinetics interpretation is problematic because it may mislead physicians into thinking that it is safe to treat refractory AD patients with escalating doses of memantine, together with donepezil, and this could have unfortunate consequences"

It says that the trial is not yet recruiting in the link, below, but presumably then it will be soon.

Previous, similar trials were conducted in the U.S. but stopped in 1994, where it has been a Schedule I drug since the 60's, citing concerns about cardiotoxicity. However, there are numerous, numerous reports of Ibogaine being used to help people with wish to stop many different substances and ""legal grey zone clinics"" run in Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, New Zealand (where it's legal with prescription), Gabon, Guatemala (where it's legal for treatment in a center), and South Africa, where Ibogaine is unscheduled.

Brazil may be on track to legalizing Ibogaine treatment clinics for alcoholism if these trials progress:

> Cognitive deficits linked with early-onset MJ use were present within several years after MJ use began and may result from, predispose to, or share a common cause with early-onset MJ use. The DMN was affected by MDD, MJ and their combination, as well as by early-onset MJ use. BDNF carrier state may predispose to early-onset MJ use.

Feb 2016: [Impact of adolescent marijuana use on intelligence: Results from two longitudinal twin studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4747759/), [Science Magazine](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/twins-study-finds-no-evidence-marijuana-lowers-iq-teens)

> Marijuana is the most commonly used recreational drug in the United States. Some studies suggest that marijuana use in adolescence is linked to declines in intellectual functioning. Because of the infeasibility of studying this phenomenon experimentally, it is unclear whether the association can be causally attributed to marijuana use itself or is instead the result of confounding factors. We approach this issue quasiexperimentally using longitudinal samples of adolescent twins. Among twin pairs discordant for marijuana use, we assessed intelligence quotient (IQ) score changes while adjusting for the effects of genetic influences and other factors shared by members of the same twin pair. Results suggest that familial confounds underlie the association between adolescent marijuana use and declining IQ scores.

> Marijuana is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States, and use during adolescence—when the brain is still developing—has been proposed as a cause of poorer neurocognitive outcome. Nonetheless, research on this topic is scarce and often shows conflicting results, with some studies showing detrimental effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning and others showing no significant long-term effects. The purpose of the present study was to examine the associations of marijuana use with changes in intellectual performance in two longitudinal studies of adolescent twins (n = 789 and n = 2,277). We used a quasiexperimental approach to adjust for participants’ family background characteristics and genetic propensities, helping us to assess the causal nature of any potential associations. Standardized measures of intelligence were administered at ages 9–12 y, before marijuana involvement, and again at ages 17–20 y. Marijuana use was self-reported at the time of each cognitive assessment as well as during the intervening period. Marijuana users had lower test scores relative to nonusers and showed a significant decline in crystallized intelligence between preadolescence and late adolescence. However, there was no evidence of a dose–response relationship between frequency of use and intelligence quotient (IQ) change. Furthermore, marijuana-using twins failed to show significantly greater IQ decline relative to their abstinent siblings. Evidence from these two samples suggests that observed declines in measured IQ may not be a direct result of marijuana exposure but rather attributable to familial factors that underlie both marijuana initiation and low intellectual attainment.

Jan 2016: [Are IQ and educational outcomes in teenagers related to their cannabis use? A prospective cohort study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881115622241)

> There is much debate about the impact of adolescent cannabis use on intellectual and educational outcomes. We investigated associations between adolescent cannabis use and IQ and educational attainment in a sample of 2235 teenagers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. By the age of 15, 24% reported having tried cannabis at least once. A series of nested linear regressions was employed, adjusted hierarchically by pre-exposure ability and potential confounds (e.g. cigarette and alcohol use, childhood mental-health symptoms and behavioural problems), to test the relationships between cumulative cannabis use and IQ at the age of 15 and educational performance at the age of 16. After full adjustment, those who had used cannabis ⩾50 times did not differ from never-users on either IQ or educational performance. Adjusting for group differences in cigarette smoking dramatically attenuated the associations between cannabis use and both outcomes, and further analyses demonstrated robust associations between cigarette use and educational outcomes, even with cannabis users excluded. These findings suggest that adolescent cannabis use is not associated with IQ or educational performance once adjustment is made for potential confounds, in particular adolescent cigarette use. Modest cannabis use in teenagers may have less cognitive impact than epidemiological surveys of older cohorts have previously suggested.

Mar 2016: [Association Between Lifetime Marijuana Use and Cognitive Function in Middle Age](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2484906)

> Among 3385 participants with cognitive function measurements at the year 25 visit, 2852 (84.3%) reported past marijuana use, but only 392 (11.6%) continued to use marijuana into middle age. Current use of marijuana was associated with worse verbal memory and processing speed; cumulative lifetime exposure was associated with worse performance in all 3 domains of cognitive function. After excluding current users and adjusting for potential confounders, cumulative lifetime exposure to marijuana remained significantly associated with worse verbal memory. For each 5 years of past exposure, verbal memory was 0.13 standardized units lower (95% CI, −0.24 to −0.02; P = .02), corresponding to a mean of 1 of 2 participants remembering 1 word fewer from a list of 15 words for every 5 years of use. After adjustment, we found no associations with lower executive function (–0.03 [95% CI, −0.12 to 0.07]; P = .56) or processing speed (–0.04 [95% CI, −0.16 to 0.08]; P = .51).

> Past exposure to marijuana is associated with worse verbal memory but does not appear to affect other domains of cognitive function.

Mar 2013 follow-up to questions from [Rogeberg](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/11/4251.full) and [Daly](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/11/E979.full) regarding Oct 2012 paper: [Reply to Rogeberg and Daly: No evidence that socioeconomic status or personality differences confound the association between cannabis use and IQ decline

Oct 2012: [Persistent cannabis users show neuropsychological decline from childhood to midlife](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479587/), on [NIDA](https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/nida-notes/2013/08/early-onset-regular-cannabis-use-linked-to-iq-decline)

> Recent reports show that fewer adolescents believe that regular cannabis use is harmful to health. Concomitantly, adolescents are initiating cannabis use at younger ages, and more adolescents are using cannabis on a daily basis. The purpose of the present study was to test the association between persistent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline and determine whether decline is concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a prospective study of a birth cohort of 1,037 individuals followed from birth (1972/1973) to age 38 y. Cannabis use was ascertained in interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 y. Neuropsychological testing was conducted at age 13 y, before initiation of cannabis use, and again at age 38 y, after a pattern of persistent cannabis use had developed. Persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education. Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline. Further, cessation of cannabis use did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain and highlight the importance of prevention and policy efforts targeting adolescents.

May 2007: [The relationship between non-acute adolescent cannabis use and cognition](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/09595230701247772/abstract) [PDF](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b931/dc5231bed96d8c5105e78495264d2ee06532.pdf)

> Research indicates that cannabis continues to be a popular illegal drug internationally. Furthermore, adolescent rates of use appear to be significant. Whilst the non-acute effect of cannabis use on adult cognition has been extensively researched, there has been less examination of adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the non-acute relationship between cannabis and cognitive function in a sample of adolescents with a continuum of cannabis use, taking into account additional predictor variables (psychiatric functioning, general functioning, demographics and other drug use). Seventy adolescents were recruited from clinical and community sources as well as through newspaper advertisements. After 12 hours abstinence from cannabis, adolescents completed a two-hour interview covering: demographics; alcohol and drug use history; drug use in the past 28 days; depression; further psychiatric functioning (including ADHD and Conduct Disorder); and cognitive functioning as measured by computerised tasks (CANTAB) and traditional pen and paper tests. Adolescents who were regular cannabis users (more than once a week) had a significantly poorer performance on four measures of cognitive function reflecting attention, spatial working memory and learning. Cannabis use remained an independent predictor of performance on the working memory and strategy measures after additional predictor variables were included in a multivariate regression analysis. The results suggest that aspects of adolescent cognitive function are independently related to the frequency of cannabis use beyond acute intoxication.

Nov 2002: [Dose-related neurocognitive effects of marijuana use.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12427880)

> Very heavy use of marijuana is associated with persistent decrements in neurocognitive performance even after 28 days of abstinence. It is unclear if these decrements will resolve with continued abstinence or become progressively worse with continued heavy marijuana use.

Apr 2002: [Current and former marijuana use: preliminary findings of a longitudinal study of effects on IQ in young adults](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/166/7/887.full)

> Current marijuana use had a negative effect on global IQ score only in subjects who smoked 5 or more joints per week. A negative effect was not observed among subjects who had previously been heavy users but were no longer using the substance. We conclude that marijuana does not have a long-term negative impact on global intelligence. Whether the absence of a residual marijuana effect would also be evident in more specific cognitive domains such as memory and attention remains to be ascertained.

Feb 1996: [The residual cognitive effects of heavy marijuana use in college students.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8606472)

> Heavy marijuana use is associated with residual neuropsychological effects even after a day of supervised abstinence from the drug. However, the question remains open as to whether this impairment is due to a residue of drug in the brain, a withdrawal effect from the drug, or a frank neurotoxic effect of the drug.

"Depression treatment by withdrawal from drugs instead of being on them

The focus in general seems, as I wrote in the title, to be on therapeutic use of mind-altering substances. There will be speakers on treatment of addiction, depression and other psychological issues. I think that is especially interesting with the rapid increase of widespread depression in the western world we are currently experiencing. Also since psychedelics have been proven to decrease authoritarian views and increase peoples connectedness to nature, the fact that this takes place in such a restrictive place as Sweden gives me lots of hope for the future.

"Self Testing Selegiline to prevent MDMA induced neurotoxicity, an irresponsible experiment.
*TL:DR I experimented with a primer Selegiline dose to determine if it could an prevent MDMA damage and/or hangovers via MAO-B inhibition of classes of phenylethylamines theorized to cause damage though oxidation. I took MDMA at irresponsible doses and frequencies in an attempt to get a clear result. Since beginning the trial I have had no comedowns or side effects after dosing 150mg+150mg MDMA(all from the same, very good batch) for 4 weeks in a row, more attention should be payed to this interaction*

#**WARNING: Don't do this at home unless you know exactly what you are doing. There are dangers to irresponsible use of Selegiline(MAO-B inhibitor) combined with MDMA**

# **Background:**


After researching the causes of any damage done by MDMA use there seems to be no established pinpointed cause or mechanism but rather a gamut of causes including natural down-regulation of receptors, [α7-nAChR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-7_nicotinic_receptor) mediated excitotoxicity, with the main theory behind neurotoxicity as the result of the bodies' inability to keep up with the oxidative stress caused by MDMA and it's downstream effects. Overwhelming the bodies' natural anti-oxidants could be caused by a combination of neurotransmitter oxidation after massive release along with oxidation of MDMA, a MDMA metabolite, or dopamine itself reentering the presynaptic serotonin vesicles and oxidizing within the serotonin axon, either killing the axon or causing the neuron to remove the connection due to stress

Thus it is no surprise that temperature plays a huge role in damage because increased heat increases the rate of chemical reactions such as oxidation. These occur through natural mechanisms such as MAO breakdown of neurotransmitters, mitochondrial oxidation due to overexcitement, and perhaps even auto-oxidation. If the natural anti-oxidants such as [Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) are overwhelmed damage can occur in theory.

So how could one go about preventing or prophylactically priming oneself for such oxidative stress? [Memantine usage is advisable](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17980434) because of it's clear mechanism of action, relatively benign side effect profile, and the convenience 80 hour half life means that a 20mg dose Friday will result in 10mg still in your system come Sunday.

Current antioxidant supplement usage may be helpful but not a bulletproof fix. Alpha-Lipoic Acid has a very low half-life of 30-60 minutes, Vitamin C has a half life of only 7 minutes but personally I like putting vitamin C packets whenever I fill my camelback even if it has little to no effect.

With all of these precautions I still feel that there is some damage occurring or at least a significant hangover effect. I recently had stumbled upon an article about [Selegiline's usefulness in preventing MDMA neurotoxicity *independent of body temperature levels*](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/38/10203.full.pdf)

If one were to inhibit MAO-B it would reduce the overall rate of oxidation in the brain of the chemicals suspected of causing damage, leaving a longer half life of dopamine and maybe even MDMA metabolites while reducing the spike of ROS so that the brain can more easily cope over time. This is probably the mechanism for the damage reduction found in rat studies. There is a danger here however. Even though Selegiline is selective to MAO-B 14 times more than  MAO-A. [Normal daily doses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249059) over long periods of time may also inhibit MAO-A to some significant level. **MAO-A inhibition during MDMA use is a very very bad idea** MAO-A metabolizes all of the main amines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and most importantly serotonin. Inhibition of serotonin breakdown plus MDMA serotonin release could easily lead to [Serotonin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome), which depending on the severity, a potentially fatal condition due to the bodies' inability to clear serotonin that continues to build up with MDMA use. However because of the long MAO-B half life it is possible to target it relatively easy with only a few doses.

[Selegiline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selegiline) is an irreversible selective [MAO-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_B) inhibitor, MAO-B is monoamine oxidase enzyme that actively catalyses oxidation only of phenylethylamines like MDMA, dopamine, and trace amines. Because Selegiline is irreversible the permanently inoperative enzyme must be cleared from the body and new ones produced. The half life for MAO-B is a staggering long time ranging into weeks. So one or two doses of Selegiline could have therapeutic effects weeks after even one dose if they were to inhibit MAO-B significantly without high enough concentrations to even get near MAO-A. This in fact is actually the case! [""Within 2 to 4 hours of an oral dose of selegiline 10 mg, 86% of the platelet MAO-B activity was inhibited and it took almost 2 weeks for platelet MAO-B activity to return to the baseline values.""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9260033)



#The Experiment


On this evidence, for science, I decided to use my body as a test case. Here are my completely unscientific guinea pig trials. In order to test my theory I would have take MDMA doses that would be safe but otherwise irresponsible longterm to try to provoke a response to more likely get a non-null result. **All MDMA was taken from the same batch and tested extremely well. It is from a very reputable vendor who's MDMA was independently tested through GC:MS at greater than 90%**

* **History and confounding variables:**

Male, 6'3 late 20's 200lb. Since October of last year I have been rolling once every 6 weeks or less frequently. I could gradually feel the reduction in effects or perhaps I was just becoming more familiar with the effects. Before October I had not rolled in almost a year.

I also take 20mg Memantine, 2g ALCAR attack dose, and Chelated Magnesium several hours before every roll.


#The Hangover Semi Control
> * **Mid-March:**
> 
> This is after rolling maybe 6 times every 6 weeks(never two days in a row).
> I'll qualify this as a semi-control even though LSD was involved.
> 150ug LSD 3 hours in 150mg MDMA with a 150 MDMA redose 2 hours in.
> 
> Roll was extremely hard, second dose did much less than it usually would. The week after was a very hard comedown with strange dreams, cold sweats, and sleep disturbances typical of MDMA stress induced damage.
> 
> 




# The Trials

I decided to take at least a 3 month break after this, then I stumbled upon Selegiline. To test Selegiline I attempted to take a 150+150mg dose of MDMA each week for as many weeks as I felt comfortable doing, no 5-htp was taken in-between any of these rolls:

# First Trial
> * **2nd week of June -  300mg**
> * **Results: hard roll, no comedown, no hangover effects, afterglow**
> 
> Selegiline preload:
> 
> * 4 days before roll took 10mg Selegiline with food (food increases bioavailability significantly)
> * 3 days before roll took 5mg Selegiline with food
> 
> MDMA dosage:
> 150mg MDMA and redosed 150mg 2.5 hours in. Typical insanely good roll after 3 month break. I dropped first at 10pm and the effects lingered till 6am. 
> 
> * Results:
> 
> Safety wise, I informed my friends what I was doing and what to look for, I was self monitoring for Serotonin Syndrome and had Seroquel and Xanax on hand for all tests.
> 

# Second Trial
> * **3rd week of June -  300mg**
> * **Results: Light long roll, no comedown, no hangover effects, slight afterglow**
> 
> Selegiline preload:
> 
> * 4 days before roll took 10mg Selegiline with food
> * 3 days before roll took 5mg Selegiline with food
> 
> MDMA dosage:
> 150mg MDMA and redosed 150mg 2.5 hours in. 
> 
> * Results:
> 
> The roll was very light but lasted about 7 hours much much longer and at a low level than others' hard rolls that lasted quickly. Perhaps this was because my serotonin was mostly depleted from the week before and Selegiline was increasing the half-life of dopamine or MDMA metabolites. Serotonin effects persisted thought the entire roll and I felt no excess speediness. There was absolutely no comedown, if anything there was an afterglow that reminded me of the first few times rolling. The next week was very normal with no symptoms at all.

#Third Trial
> * **4th week of June - 300mg**
> * **Results: Light long roll, no comedown, no hangover effects, slight afterglow**
> 
> 
> Selegiline preload:
> 
> * 4 days before roll took 10mg Selegiline with food 
> * 3 days before roll took 10mg Selegiline with food
> 
> MDMA dosage:
> 150mg MDMA and redosed 150mg 2.5 hours in. Exact same result as previous weeks test. Light roll considering low serotonin levels, lasting very long, no comedown just gradual dissipation of effects and no hangover the next week.

#Fourth Trial

"Burnt vs vaporized marijuana differences perhaps more complicated than currently thought?
When discussing the differences between the psychoactive effects of vaporized cannabis vs combusted cannabis, the current consensus seems to be that the carbon monoxide and benzene produced by combustion are responsible for the ""doping"" effect of smoked marijuana, with some research indicating that some cannabinoids may not be vaporized at common temperatures, and so the presence of such cannabinoids exclusively in combusted marijuana is thought to also alter the perceived high.

I've always been skeptical that carbon monoxide or benzene play much of a role in the perceived high, based mostly on the fact that the first is cleared rapidly from the bloodstream as oxygen stabilizes CO into CO2 (fresh air is essentially the antidote to most cases of minor CO exposure). As such it only makes sense that the CO produced from combustion could influence the high for no more than a few minutes, and I wouldn't be surprised if it has little effect at all given that people are often exposed to far greater quantities for longer periods, without noticing (in terms of household accidental exposure). The only effect that I can reasonably connect to the CO content in the smoke would be the initial ""rush"" users frequently experience from smoked cannabis (but do often do not from vaporized cannabis).

It seems unlikely that differences in acute effects are caused by other toxic constituents of smoke either. I draw this conclusion most strongly based on the fact that cigarettes which produce the same toxic chemicals still have a very stimulatory effect. If that theory were correct (that the toxic byproducts of smoking cause the alleged ""fogginess""/laziness of smoking), it seems to me that cigarettes would also share the same problem. If that case is true, nicotine's positive effects on cognition (mild stimulation, small working memory boost, etc) would not likely be sufficient to ""cancel out"" the alleged negative acute effects of these toxins, as the two work in entirely different ways. Nicotine does it's work through agonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the toxins simply damage cells and impair various metabolic processes. Simply stimulating nAch receptors would not alleviate those actions. Essentially; if these toxins are responsible for the more sedative high, cigarettes would have the same problem, perhaps to a lesser degree given their stimulatory nature, but it should nevertheless still be noticeable.

I have a feeling that the difference in the high itself between the two methods of cannabis consumption is more related to the combination of cannabinoids and terpenes being received. Smoking probably gives some measure of all of the plants active contents (though possibly destroying much of certain more temperature-sensitive compounds), whereas vaporization probably misses out on certain cannabinoids that require higher temperatures.

In my own experience, I've noticed that quite often I experience a mild ""crash"" from vaporized cannabis; that is the high feels clearer as expected, but towards the end leaves me in a much more tired and cognitively impaired state. Smoked cannabis produces what seems to be a more inebriating high, but seems to end more ""gracefully"". My thoughts were that perhaps CBD is the major factor; as it serves to modulate the activity of THC (reducing CB1 receptor activity). It could be that having a greater ratio of CBD to THC results in a less ""intense"" high that is more rapidly recovered from."

"Heroin - I think I've ruined my brain.
I've been sober from heroin/opiates for 3.5 years now, and while life has improved greatly by 10-fold, my mind isn't what it used to be. I exercise daily, meditate as often as I can, eat nothing but raw fruits, veggies, nuts and all the proper nutrients, read and exercise my brain as much as possible, but I suffer bouts of short term and long term memory loss. I don't even smoke and the last alcohol I had was on New Years. 

I can't recall a lot of my life before my addiction, until something spurs my brain. Even then, there's a 50% chance I'm going to confuse the details. My vocational skills in person are poor now and responses take me some time to collect and to orate, so I sound mentally disabled- even trying to talk to a grocery clerk for small talk. My wit and sharpness has all but evaporated and this is confirmed with friends who knew me before. There's a unhealthy lack of empathy and an over abundance of sympathy for those I encounter, I wish I could explain it.

Could there be something neurologically wrong with me? I've been putting forth 99% effort into repairing myself and taking on new, healthy lifestyle, but I'm half tempted to end it all because I struggle with simple office tasks at my job. And no woman in this world wants a stay-at-home dad.

"Does anyone think we should be treating anhedonia with dopamine agonists/modulators?
I know Wellbutrin and Abilify have some dopaminergic action, and there's an [intriguing case report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4655898/) about Abilify treating a case of ""apathy syndrome"" (which I didn't realize was a thing). It seems to me that drugs like cocaine are so enjoyable because they make other things more enjoyable, and if you're anhedonic, the one thing you need the most is for things to be more enjoyable. I don't have studies to cite, but I believe that this effect comes from dopaminergic enhancement.

I realize that long-term dopamine agonism will likely lead to dependency. However, I don't know if this should be a disqualifier... taking a medication for the rest of one's life might provide a net benefit to the individual if the drug is affordable and has acceptable side effects.

Does anyone else agree with this? I also wonder how many cases of depression are fueled by anhedonia, and if this might be a good treatment strategy for depression in general.

**Edit:** Curious if COMT genetics might regulate how addictive dopaminergic drugs are... if a mutation resulted in weaker dopamine degradation, would that translate into a gentler comedown, or even a therapeutic afterglow?

"Neurobiology of psychedelic drugs

Neuroscience research has recently begun to investigate the acute effects of psychedelic drugs on the human brain. Brain imaging has been performed on participants in the acute drug state for LSD (e.g. Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), psilocybin (e.g. Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and ayahuasca/DMT (e.g. Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015), enabling researchers to piece together a possible model for the effects of these substances.

Studies of the psychedelic state typically show changes in the connectivity and activity of brain regions constituting the “default mode network” (DMN), particularly regions that are usually highly active, such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014; Raichle et al., 2001). The DMN is a network of brain regions that is typically engaged when the mind wanders, and is often thought to support metacognitive processes such as self-reflection, thinking about others, and thinking about one’s past and future (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014; Raichle and Snyder, 2007).

Although the connectivity of brain regions comprising the DMN appears integral to sustaining normal waking consciousness, it has also been pointed out that this may come at the price of restricting other possible brain states and thus limiting conscious experience (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). Indeed, while the integrity of communication between brain regions within this network appears to be decreased by psychedelic drugs, there are also increases in connectivity between what are usually more independently functioning brain networks, and these connectivity changes are correlated with the altered state of consciousness under the influence of psychedelics (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Hence, it seems that in the acute drug phase, psychedelics disrupt normal or even entrenched patterns of brain activity that characterize waking experience, enabling a greater range of activity patterns to surface (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014). This may explain the unusual insights and perspectives that frequently become available under the influence of psychedelics. In support of this possibility, Lebedev et al. (2016) found that reduced organization of brain activity during the acute drug phase predicted later increases in the personality dimension of openness, a dimension that includes facets such as intellectual curiosity and creativity. Higher magnetoencephalography signal diversity in spontaneous brain activity was also observed in participants experiencing altered states of consciousness after taking LSD, psilocybin, or ketamine, and preliminary evidence was found suggesting that these signal diversity measures were related to the intensity of the psychedelic state (Schartner et al., 2017).

Brain regions that appear most affected by the administration of psychedelics in humans overlap with sites that have a high density of serotonin 2 A (5-HT2A) receptors (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), corroborating animal and human research indicating that psychedelic drugs act primarily through agonistic activity at 5-HT2A receptors (Glennon et al., 1984; see Nichols, 2004; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010 for reviews). Recent research in humans provided concrete evidence for the role of 5-HT2A receptors in the altered state of consciousness brought about by psychedelics: ketanserin—a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist—completely blocked the subjective effects of LSD (Kraehenmann et al., 2017; Preller et al., 2017).

Such agonistic effects may underpin not only the acute drug state, but also longer-term changes as a result of psychedelic usage. For example, it has been found (in rodents) that repeated administration of LSD lead to the reduced expression of 5-HT2A receptors, particularly in prefrontal cortical areas (Buckholtz et al., 1990). These receptors are overexpressed in the brains of humans with depression (Meyer et al., 2003), are linked to stress resilience in healthy individuals (Frokjaer et al., 2008), and are also targets of antidepressant drugs (Yamauchi et al., 2006). Hence, changes to 5-HT2A receptor sites, particularly in prefrontal cortical regions involved in the regulation of emotion, could be partly responsible for long-term outcomes as a result of psychedelic use.

"Why are dopamine releasing agents euphoric, but dopamine reuptake inhibitors are dysphoric and aversive?
[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953830)

[pdf](http://docdro.id/AglOvMG)

Common stimulants such as dopamine releasing agents (Amphetamine, Methamphetamine) and DAT inverse agonists (Cocaine, Methylphenidate, certain cathinones) are euphoric because of their dopamine release - Releasing agents do it through TAAR1 agonism and DAT inverse agonism do that extra neuronally by reversing DAT's action, resulting in a firing-dependent retrotransport of dopamine into the synaptic cleft.


Dopamine reuptake inhibitors, which are competitive DAT blockers, are aversive and dysphoric. Mazindol, Nomifensine, Tesofensine, Sibutramine and GBR12909 are all dopamine reuptake inhibitors with DAT affinity equal to or higher than Cocaine, yet [they don't induce any stimulant effects or feelings of euphoria when given either orally or intravenously](https://gyazo.com/a7068b4135b3c2976fa92e2ffc63d134). 


GBR12909 has a 100 times higher DAT affinity than Cocaine, yet Cocaine injection results in a higher increase of dopamine in the synaptic cleft (even though it's DAT affinity is only 1/100th of GBR12909). This suggests Cocaine isn't a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.


Methylphenidate is a DAT inverse agonist like Cocaine. An 1997 study by Nira Volkow reported that for Methylphenidate to produce euphoria, it has to occupy >80% of all DAT sites in the CNS. What was surprising is that while a first injection of Methylphenidate produced 80% DAT blockade, this did not prevent the subsequent ""high"" induced by a second injection of Methylphenidate given 60 minutes later. That raises a question - if Methylphenidate blocked 80% of the DAT sites, how was it able to produce euphoria with a second dose after this blockade? The answer is that Methylphenidate's effect isn't dependent upon DAT's availability, therefore it is, like Cocaine, not a dopamine reuptake inhibitors.


As stated above, all dopamine reuptake inhibitors given to humans, regardless of potency, failed to induce feelings of ""high"" or euphoria.


Furthermore, Methylphenidate has no ceiling effect, and its effect on dopamine efflux is [extremely similar to that seen with Amphetamine](https://i.gyazo.com/e10369cad6ff09112bd946e73d4e6e2d.png).

Therefore, it would be logical to conclude that Methylphenidate and Cocaine, two highly potent stimulants, aren't dopamine reuptake inhibitors and even though they act on DAT outside the pre-synaptic neuron, they have a different mechanism than reuptake inhibitors.

*TL;DR*: Dopamine release is euphoric while dopamine reuptake inhibition is dysphoric and aversive (Cocaine and Methylphenidate are not reuptake inhibitors, as stated in the paper above).

**My question is** - why would dopamine reuptake inhibition be aversive and not produce euphoria? Dopamine release is clearly highly rewarding, but dopamine reuptake inhibition seems to be aversive and not produce any euphoria at all. But why? Why is dopamine that stays stuck in the synapse produce aversive feelings, but new dopamine being released results in euphoria?"
"Why are Reuptake Inhibitors so different than Releasers?
I've recently noticed that many users of Releasers report different effects than users of Reuptake Inhibitors, and vice versa. As we all know, Releasers (usually Amphetamines) work by reversing the reuptake pumps, while reuptake inhibitors just block them.

Why is there such a big difference between these types of drugs?

For example, Methylphenidate (better known as Ritalin) is a Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor used to treat ADHD. Many Ritalin users report increased feeling of concentration (dopamine->motivation->concentration), but at the same time feelings of being ""robots"" and ""zombies"" - weird feelings that make them feel bad.

On the other hand, users of Adderall (75%-25% d-amphetamine:l-amphetamine, respectively) report feelings of motivation, talkativeness, sociability and enhancements. Generally, most people that have tried both Adderall and Ritalin said Ritalin made them feel like zombies and just gave them awkward feelings, while Adderall is much better for them and has a very good effect.

My question is why? Both drugs boost levels of dopamine in the synpase in different ways, but the end result is the same - increased neurotransmission of dopamine. If the result of the same, why do people usually report better outcomes with Adderall than with Ritalin? Why Ritalin makes people feel bad, where Adderall works much better for most people?

It does not end here, though. If we take a look at serotonergic drugs, we can see that also there, Releasers are dramatically different than Reuptake Inhibitors. MDMA is a serotonin releaser and it causes feelings of empathy and sociability. SSRIs increase serotonin by inhibiting its reuptake, but the effects from SSRIs are not even close to the effects from MDMA, even though both of them increase serotonin levels.

**TL;DR:** Drugs that release neurotransmitters usually have very different effects from drugs that inhibit the reuptake of the same neurotransmitter, even though both categories cause the same end result - more neurotransmission. Why are their effects different, then?"

"William Leonard Pickard - Predicting Opioid & Fentanyl Crisis - Looking for further literature
There is a section in William Leonard Pickard's Wikipedia page detailing his predictions of the current opioid/fentanyl crisis:

""Pickard's 1996 Prediction of the Current Fentanyl and Carfentanyl Epidemic[edit]
Pickard was the first American researcher to predict an epidemic of fentanyl and carfentanyl. At Harvard, he was appointed as a research associate in neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, where he was a drug policy fellow in the ad hoc Harvard Initiative on Drugs and Addictions, under the Program in Mind, Brain and Behavior.[6] In a presentation at the Harvard Faculty Club in 1996, Pickard proposed that fentanyl and carfentanyl use would become epidemic, and suggested specific policies for preventing wide-spread abuse. Pickard's prediction was 20 years in advance of the current opioid crisis.[6]

In federal court on March 12-13, 2003, Pickard testified in detail on this prediction, based upon his research among more than 200 addicts in Boston and Moscow and his study of rare fentanyl use. Original overheads from the Harvard Faculty Club presentation were seized by DEA in a Boston locker in November, 2000, and retained by the agency until trial in 2003, where they were entered as defense exhibits. This testimony, as a public record, was more than 15 years before the actual epidemic occurred.[7]""

However, the sources provided give no further information on these predictions. I was wondering if anybody here could provide any information. Anything is greatly appreciated. "

"How can THC inhibit/damage the development of the adolescent brain?
There have been a few studies published lately that say that THC can inhibit adolescent brain development and even damage the adolescent brain^[[1]](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130827091401.htm)[[2]](http://rt.com/news/204311-usa-cannabis-brain-decrease/) . 

I looked for how CB1 activation affects other systems and have found that it inhibits Glutamate release - this  TEMPORARILY impairs learning (since Glutamate is the most important neurotransmitter for cognition), but is also neuroprotective (high concentrations of Glutamate are excitotoxic).

How can it be that THC could be damaging to the brain? It's just a partial agonist at CB1 receptors, so how can it even cause damage?

The endo-cannabinoid system is very important for mood, behavior, appetite and more. So why can THC, which is only a partial agonist, damage the brain by activating receptors naturally found in it?

I understand how Amphetamines could be neurotoxic - they flood the brain with monoamines, leading to oxidative stress which is directly neurotoxic.

But how does THC damage some parts of the brain just by activating CB1 receptors? Is the activation of the endo-cannabinoid system directly related to brain damage?"

Over the last year, a friend with permanent hearing loss in his left ear experimented with 4-fluoro-amphetamine on multiple occasions.

After taking 4-FA, he reported a consistent and temporary reversal of hearing loss in his left ear. I am witness to this happening, and I was able to confirm by using soft dialogue in his left ear and then having him repeat the words. He reported that it was the first time he had experienced auditory stimulus in that ear in almost a decade. The effects wore off within a few hours of the 4-fa dissipating. Lower doses did not have as profound an effect, but around 80-160mg produced the effect consistently.

"THC and nicotine
Hi so i enjoy high THC/CBD ratio cannabis (pure sativas) and nicotine for their stimulatory properties. Ive heard anecdotes that nicotine can ""level you out"" from a cannabis high but i havent noticed this personally, in fact i believe the opposite is true.

Ive learned here (http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/245tku/any_suggestions_for_countering_negative_effects/ch4u5cu) that THC depletes acetylcholine levels but you can take choline supplements to correct this, preventing grogginess and memory loss while still allowing you to enjoy the high. I know nicotine imitates acetylcholine, so could you use nicotine to supplement your acetylcholine levels while on THC?

Or does it simply enhance your stimulant experience?

Or do they combine in some reverse way that i am not understanding?

"What the hell does the sigma receptor do?
There seems to be an increasing amount of literature on sigma receptor binding and its promise in therapeutics. Pharmaceutical company avanir is even touting sigma-1 agonism as a primary mechanism for dextromethorphan as a treatment for schizophrenia and pseudobulbar affect.

I havent chanced upon any literature that definitively points to sigma-1 as responsible for any outward phenotype or disease. mouse KO's seem fine. haloperidol and cocaine both exert sigma-1 activity, and I don't see any therapeutic overlap between the two.

Agonism of sigma does confer some sort of antidepressant effect in mouse models, but that's probably the strongest line of evidence, and it could be more from a ""stim"" effect than an antidepressant one.

It's positited to have a role in everything from addiction to microglial activation to Ca2+ regulation to fatigue in pregnancy, or just ""many biological processes associated with neurodegeneration"" Things just sound so fluffy and BS-ey.

"Do you think there are still any good undiscovered psychedelics out there? Or are psychedelic RCs now scraping the bottom of the barrel? (x-post from r/Drugs)
Is it just me, or are psychedelic RCs these days fairly pale imitations of their counterparts? The majority of the 2C-x series is now illegal in most of the western world, only to be replaced by the generally worse received, and considerably more dangerous, 25x series.

Other examples include the recent release of Mescaline analogs such as Allylescaline and Escaline which have been reviewed by many as pale imitations of Mescaline, often with worse side-effects. 5-MeO-DALT and bk-2C-B seem to have also had a similarly luke-warm reception.

There seems to be a similar situation in the world of dissociatives as well - since the blanket arylcyclohexylamine ban in the UK there has been a rise in far more risky and potentially dangerous compounds, such as Diphenidine, MK-801, Memantine and more worryingly Amantadine, recreational use of which degrades the effectiveness of Amantadine as an antiviral.

Is the world of psychedelic RCs going to go the same way as the recent Cathinone analogs? Some recent developments that give me hope are the new ergoloids (AL-LAD, LSZ) and the 2C-x-5EtO family, which seem to go a bit more in a nootropic direction, 2C-D-5EtO in particular. Also interesting, though not necessarily from a recreational point of view, are Salvinorin A analogs, such as Salvinorin B Ethoxymethyl Ether.

What do you think? Is there still hope for interesting new developments in the world of psychedelics? Or are RC chemists now scraping the bottom of Shulgin's barrel?"

"A speculative look at whether occasional use of methamnetamine (MNA) could present unusual chronic toxicity risk to humans.
Some of you will be aware of work done in the past to [replicate the MDMA experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/224llv/the_mdma_experience_can_be_replicated_with_less/) in a way which hopes to mitigate toxicity and aftereffects. This was subjectively very successful with MDAI and 2-FMA.

With MDAI seemingly non-existent since the ban in China some time ago, some thought has been given to alternative serotonin releasers and [methamnetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamnetamine) has been proposed but the inclusion of a naphthalene moeity triggered some caution. 

I thought I'd do a bit of reading and consolidate my thoughts publicly for posterity and criticism.

The obvious mitigating circumstance is that adding anything to a simple aromatic hydrocarbon immediately and significantly improves the body's ability to dismantle it. This is further improved when a polar bond is present in the molecule, such as the C-NHMe bond in methamnetamine. In these cases the body can either deaminate, demethylate and/or conjugate rather than needing to resort to the much more difficult direct oxidation of the aromatic system.

And then excrete these metabolites, or even excrete the molecule unchanged. 35-55% of metham**ph**etamine is excreted unchanged,^[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12324487) so for a normal 150mg dose of metham**n**etamine it's reasonable that c.120mg of metabolites are produced in a worst case scenario.

It seems reasonable to treat this compound like methylnaphthalene  in a worst case scenario (no polar bonds), so if this was the only metabolite, would that present major concern when taken every three months? 

It's hard to find directly relevant studies since most look at the more dangerous napthalene and have to use daily exposure to give measurable effects.

Looking at [this review](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-03/documents/naphthalene_toxicology_profile_tp67_3v.pdf), there is no evidence of direct genotoxicity (DNA damage). Studies generally use napthalene itself with doses 2-3 orders (even after allosteric scaling) of magnitude higher than those considered here. With lower doses, studies report no adverse effects. 

The review explores the metabolic products from methylnaphthalene and suggests that 1,4-napthyl-quinone is not produced, which is thought to be the primary driver behind the indirect tumour promoting effects with napthalene.^[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio791)

The review concludes by recommending for *napthalene itself*:

> A *max recommended limit* of 0.6 mg/kg/day for acute oral exposure to naphthalene is based on a minimal *lowest-observed-adverse-effect level* of 50 mg/kg/day for clinical signs of toxicity in pregnant rats and a total uncertainty factor of 90 (3 for the use of a minimal LOAEL, 10 for extrapolation from animals to humans, and 3 for human variability). The acute-duration oral MRL of 0.6 mg/kg/day is adopted as the intermediate-duration oral MRL for naphthalene. 

This represents a huge safety margin for a compound we reasonably believe to be much *more* dangerous than the compound in question.

Finally, [Centanafadine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centanafadine) has a very similar molecular composition and has passed animal and early human trials to make it to phase 3 trials. This strongly suggests that an naphthyl-ethylamine doesn't share the same issues that napthalene does. 

In conclusion, it seems that the concern here is as valid as a concern that methamphetamine might fragment and produce the same long term toxicity concerns as benzene. That's not to say that ingesting any of these chemicals is desirable for one's long term health. Indeed, even the *intended* effects of these compounds come with significant risks, especially when doses are miscalculated (or not calculated at all).

"Full list of Datura stramonium alkaloids from a 2016 study.

I don't have a link to the full study, but I did purchase it for myself. I was too intrigued not too, after reading one particularly tempting line from the abstract....

> GC-MS characterization revealed the presence of atropine, scopolamine, **amphetamine**, 3-methoxyamphetamine, 3-ethoxyamhetamine, cathine, spermine, phenylephrine, and 3-piperidinemethanol, among others in the extracts.

So, I got myself the study, and sure enough, amphetamine is listed, along with a few simple derivatives and cathine, as well as a couple of even more unexpected things, including *a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-substituted amphetamine derivative!?* (In other words, a DOx drug!)

There are two separate lists in the study, representing the alkaloids found in the leaves and fruits, respectively. Fascinatingly, the leaf list does not include atropine or scopolamine at all, while it does include the DOx drug. Here is the leaf list first, with the things that stand out the most to me in bold, and how much of the extract those specifically make up in parentheses afterward.

It has some striking similarities to both DON and the Aleph series if you ask me, but of course who could say whether or not it's active? It also seems to be present in pretty small amounts, but it's still quite interesting.

So, there you have it. I just thought I'd share this because I personally find it quite interesting, and I'm not aware of these lists being available anywhere for free yet. I would also be willing to share more information about them if anyone has any questions, such as the percentages listed for the other molecules.

Does anyone else here have any thoughts on all of this? Or have you noticed some interesting chemicals in the lists that I've missed? There sure does seem to be quite a lot of pharmacological potential in there!"

"A simple method from a paper to separate cocaine and levamisole/tetramisole
Disclaimer: I'm not a chemist.

I just read a paper (The Separation of Cocaine and Phenyltetrahydroimidazothiazole Mixtures, Microgram Journal, Volume 10, Number 2) that showed working methods to separate cocaine HCl from tetramisole/levamisole HCl, two of the methods described are liquid-liquid extractions and thus can be performed by anyone!


Materials:

* Water (distilled if possible)
* Ammonium Hydroxide solution (paper doesnt say, probably 28% then) (only for method 1)
* Paper Filter
* Hexane
* Heating plate with temperature control
* Beakers
* Round-bottom glass
* Separation Funnel
* Cocaine+tetramisole/levamisole

The one that yielded best results: 

Convert material to base form by in a beaker dissolving the mixture in boiling water and adding dilute ammonium hydroxide until the solution is basic and precipitation occurs. [note: in the paper its not needed since there its definitely only a cocaine+tetramisole mixture, but with your material you will want to add the water, then if anything doesnt dissolve filter it to remove these impurities, then carry on.]
Allow the mixture to cool, then remove the water (pour in another beaker through a filter to hold the mixture, as freebase cocaine and levamisole are not water soluble). 
Allow the remaining base mixture to dry overnight. In a round bottom glass combine the mixture with hexane (5mL hexane for each 50mg of material)
Heat at 75ºC for approximately 5 min.
Once the solution cools, add 5mL water for each 50mg of material. Shake vigorously to mix, and then rotate for a while to start separating the two layers of solvent again. In the paper they just used a centrifuge, but hexane and water will probably separate again well if you just let it rest for a while.
Remove the hexane layer and wash again with water, repeat the washing process up to four times, more washes will yield purer product. 
After you have made the amount of washes you decided to, evaporate the solvent to dryness.
On the procedure descvribed in the paper, in the 85:15 and 70:30 mixtures, tetramisole was COMPLETELY removed (confirmed through FTIR and GC/FID analysis) from the hexane after washing with water five times due 

to its preferentiad solubility in water. In the 50:50 mixture cocaine 99+% was obtained.
They tried the same procedure with ether instead of hexane too but it was unsuccessful.

Table with the exact results for this method

	# Number Washes /	% cocaine base achieved	
	(85:15)	      (70:30)		(50:50)
	
	#1  94.4		84.3  		77.0
	#2  97.9  		93.5  		88.2
	#3  99.2  		97.3  		95.8
	#4  99.7  		99.1  		98.5
	#5  100.0  	100.0  		99.4

So generally 2-3 washes at the last step is good enough I think, your cocaine probably wont have more than 5-15% levamisole/tetramisole at start, but rather other cuts, so you may want to do a acetone wash before this procedure to remove those."

"Besides the standard SSRI's, MAOI's, psychedelics, and some disassociates, what unlikely mind-altering chemicals are in your toolbox to treat depression and addiction
Every month theres a link to a news story on ketamine, the miracle drug for depression, MDMA for PTSD, and shrooms for depression/cluster-headaches. Yes, its great that people are feeling better, but what else can help people?

I've heard a bit here and there (anecdotal and scientific) about salvia being a good emergency anti-relapse drug, and also somewhat of an anti-depressive. Personal experience agree's with this...

Also, IMO tramadol is a great mood lifter for a while, really gives your feel-goods and feel-happys a nice boost and turns those slumps around pretty well. It's a mostly a mu opiate agonist, but also a serotonin releasing agent, norepinephrine  reuptake inhibitor, and a weak NMDA antagonist, and 5ht2c antagonist. 5ht2c agonists and antagonists downregulate 5ht2c, and this sensitizes the reward pathways, so I think this is why I feel great the next day. Together it blends so well for a dreamy, energetic, and happy day. And as a bonus, it get metabolized into a stronger opiate that really kicks in around bedtime.

Also, Ibogaine sounds impressive, and  5h1a agonists seem to have potential....

"Is carbon monoxide an important anti-anxiety--and perhaps addictive--factor in tobacco smoke (and perhaps even marijuana smoke)?
*Edited forward: I just wanted to establish, to those likening CO to CO2, that CO is quite distinct from either O2 or CO2. It has 200 times the binding affinity for hemoglobin that oxygen gas has, and has a half-life of 4 to 6 hours, giving it a very different pharmacological profile from either O2 or CO2, both of which dissociate readily when the concentration gradient and blood pH are optimal.*

So I had recently read that [mild CO poisoning causes euphoric side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1726575/pdf/v022p00754.pdf) and I got to thinking; *""Could inhaling tobacco smoke, or even marijuana smoke, cause a sufficient dose of carbon monoxide to produce mood-altering effects and, if so, could this effect foster dependence or addiction over time?""*

It's certainly with chagrin that we have yet to find a reliable method to aid smoking cessation, and anyone who has tried and failed will tell you a similar story: ""It just isn't the same as smoking a cigarette."" The same goes for vaping marijuana, which many people will agree has distinctions in subjective experience when compared to smoking it.

I've been aware for some time that [carbon monoxide is an anti-inflammatory molecule produced by the body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10742149), and that it has [neuroprotective effects in the body as a result](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28655348). However, it's a difficult task to try and reverse-engineer the MAP-K pathway that CO uses to exert this effect to see if it has an addictive aspect.

I remembered MAP-K from somewhere else, somewhere relevant... and it turns out that [amphetamines increase MAP-K phosphorylation in rodent synapses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3546198/).

This MOA would explain why even when junkies smoke something that won't give them any benefits (such as crushed valium) they can still report a pronounced high--because the carbon monoxide has enough effect to trigger a powerful placebo. It also explains why just about anything, when smoked, will produce at least a calming side effect.

It also explains why current treatments to stop habits that involve smoking have such a high rate of failure--because none of them have the complete package. The MAP-K activity would make for a significant difference.

The only thing left is to determine whether there is a significant effect from smoking on carbon monoxide levels, and while I normally detest the moralistic overstatement that goes into just about every educational source on tobacco, I was pleased to find a sensational article that led me to research showing that [smoking can increase carboxyhemoglobin levels from as low as 1.9% to over 20% with enough smoking, and that these levels revert when abstinence is practiced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739872).

So there you have it. An at-least-substantive case, I would say, that our current approaches to combustion ROAs are lacking a key piece of the puzzle. On the positive side, occasional, mild CO exposure could prove a worthwhile exploration in the treatment of panic disorders. I would be very interested in any criticism/discussion to be had on the subject.

*Addendum: After a quick search I found another article on this sub about the pharmacological effects of carbon monoxide that describes several beneficial uses for carbon monoxide in animal tests. What [the article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.1015/full) also says, however, is that CO-releasing molecules showed much more promising results than simply inhaled gaseous CO. I'd be very interested to see if these benefits might explain the prominence of tobacco as a self-medication for schizophrenia patients, where neuronal loss is believed to be a major etiology for the disease and things like neuroprotection are of the utmost importance.*"

"Is there a consensus on this sub about the neurotoxicity of Marijuana?
I have read numerous studies on the matter, and have gotten interesting conclusions from each, which were quite volatile. First things first, I would assume the proposed IQ drop from the Dunedin study by Duke has likely been refuted in a consensual manner. Many studies larger and more precise have found no evidence of a link between Marijuana usage and IQ deficits, and in one of the few recent studies that did, this effect was limited to heavy usage and was not irreversible (deficits disappeared after 3 months). 

Now I have also read studies that claim of memory deficits, although it is still up in the air if these effects are persistent. Lastly, there has been research on possible alterations of the hippocampus from Marijuana usage, although in the thread on this subject there seemed to be loads of criticism. I was wondering if this community has reached a consensus on the neurotoxicity of the drug? It seems odd, given that THC is neuro-protective at almost all doses.

P.S I would be lying if I said I don't have a vested interest in this consensus. As a smoker myself, I would like to know if this is harming my brain in any significant way, as I would stop immediately. "

"The neurochemical distinction between and MDMA afterglow vs a hard comedown?
Excuse me if this is not the appropriate sub-reddit for this question, but I'm trying to understand what is happening at a neurochemical level during a 'positive' MDMA comedown versus a 'suicide tuesday' experience.

I enjoy MDMA probably twice a year, adhere to a strict pre- and post-loading protocol (along the lines of rollsafe) and tend to dose around 130mg plus 50mg within 90 mins of the initial dose (I'm around 85kg).

My comedowns are this easy, slow, steady, gentle return to my emotional baseline over a few days.

Not only are they not a difficult experience at all, I am actually in a more positive mindset than my usual daily mindset. 

So it's not just that I don't experience a 'hangover' but rather that I am actually in a more positive and open mental and emotional space for a few days, compared to my usual baseline.

So, yeah, the MDMA ""afterglow"".

But what is happening with my brain chemistry during this period? I'm assuming that this is all about serotonin levels but is that the be-all-and-end all of what is going on?

Is it that my serotonin levels are elevated during this comedown? Is this an after effect of the MDMA or the 5HTP post-loading (120mg per day plus EGCG plus small melatonin doses).

Any thoughts appreciated."

"Ways to reduce MDMA toxicity?
Excitotoxicity of the ion channels is supposedly avoidable, or at least we could reduce the damages done to the axons by the intake of some antioxidants that will protect serotonin reuptake transporters. In this case, Vitamin C or E could do the trick but isn't an alkaloid diet a bad thing when we talk about absorption of Amphetamines and so, MDMA might reach the urines faster?

Neurotoxicity is known not to be from MDMA or MDA directly, but once a part of the MDMA is converted to MDA, your liver metabolizes it into HHA, a neurotoxin responsible of a part of the neurotoxicity. This could be prevented by drinking some grapefruit juice or any P450 inhibitors, blocking a huge part of the MDMA -> MDA.

Past a certain point (possible around 2.5mg/kg), the neurotoxicity curve is known to exponentially increase, possibly because of a saturation of clearance by the liver. Anectodaly, past 3mg/kg, the hallucinations are always starting big time and I start to see chairs and doors in the middle of the scene so I don't think this hypothesis is dumb at all. This could result in a raise of the body temperature and it's known to lead the neurotoxicity to the top because a high body temperature is what's needed to increase the potential damages done by those deadly enzymes.

Could N-Acetylcisteine efficiently protect the liver from a full MDMA cession (dose + redose with the half, around 2.5mg/kg as a whole) knowing the fact redosing N-Acetylcisteine could increase the damages the same way it increases the ethanol induced hepatotoxicity if taken after drinking?

Could loading N-Acetylcisteine reduce the recreative effects of the MDMA?

Acetaminophen is know to be hard on the liver but could Ibuprophen be efficient against the rise of the body temperature or it's still hard on the liver as well? Or is there any body temperature regulation medications that would not affect the liver or be efficient in the MDMA scenario?

"Role of dopamine vs norepinephrine in subjective psychostimulant experience?
While researching cyclazodone and related pemoline based stimulants, which are objectively described as primarily dopaminergic, and yet anecdotally described as not at all to only slightly euphoric, I've found myself baffled given my current understanding of neurochemistry. I'm aware that more dopamine ≠ more pleasure, but I was under the impression that psychostimulant euphoria was mediated primarily by dopaminergic release and/or reuptake inhibition, whereas physical stimulation was mediated by norepinephrine, hence why (in addition to increased polarity, decreased susceptibility to MAO, prevalence of fast acting ROAs, and other mild differences in binding affinity, esp serotonin related) methamphetamine is considered more euphoric than dextroamphetamine, as m-amp's decreased affinity for NE allows higher doses to be used with fewer peripheral side effects in comparison to amphetamine. And somehow, despite lacking noradrenergic affinity, the pemoline family is more potently anorexigenic than the amphetamine family?

Okay, reading that back, I realize that's a poor example; m-amp has a million confounding factors beyond dopamine and norepinephrine affinity. So a simpler example-- ephedrine. An almost exclusively noradrenergic stimulant with little (but notably not zero) recreational value, and fairly potent anorexigenic effects. Low affinity for dopamine, little ability to cross the BBB, suggesting that norepinephrine does play a role in the recreational effects of stimulants... And yet, SNRIs like atomexetine are completely devoid of recreational value, even to the point of dysphoria for some people.

This is getting long and rambly now. I guess my point is, what are the subjective effects of the weight of dopamine and norepinephrine affinities in regards to the subjective psychostimulant experience? Why are pemoline based stimulants not the holy Grail of stimulant euphoria instead of mildly pleasant nootropic antidepressants? And why are they such effective appetite suppressants?"

A recent set of in-vitro and in-vivo human analyses regarding the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of Fluorophenibut (“F-Phenibut”) reveals the similarities and differences of the compounds’ pharmacology when compared to its existing structural relatives (ie Phenibut, Baclofen, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, etc).  Since VERY little actually exists regarding Fluorophenibut’s pharmacology compared to Phenibut and Baclofen, despite the compound becoming increasingly more popular and more common on nootropic and research chemical supplier’s websites, I thought that it would be pertinent to share our initial findings with anybody who may be using this compound, or considering using it.
 
Many of you who keep track of new ‘nootropic’ and psychotropic research compounds may have noticed that recently, several fairly well-known nootropic and research chemical suppliers have been selling a new compound labeled as Fluorophenibut or “F-Phenibut”.  Since it’s initial appearance on the scene about a year ago when it first started to be widely talked about, there has been thread after thread online, on sites like Reddit and others, trying to determine it’s effect(s), mechanism(s)-of-action, and its similarity to related compounds (ie. Phenibut, Baclofen, etc).
 
Over the course of the last several months, my team and I have investigated the in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacology of Fluorophenibut in a variety of rodent models, as well as preliminary human models, and can now definitively answer many of the questions that have been posed by many would-be psychonauts across the web, who are considering trying Fluorophenibut.  In addition to this, some of the past compounds developed by Oracle Laboratories integrate Fluorophenibut (as well as other halogen-substituted phenyl GABA derivatives) in their chemical structure, or have produced Fluorophenibut as active metabolites.  (As many of you know, I personally suffer from Panic Disorder and so I have always held a special place for anxiolytic drug development, and our team has extensive experience in developing experimental drugs based upon the GABA backbone structure (although also based on novel structure as well, of course).  However, one of our newer, junior neurobiologists requested the project of examining the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of Fluorophenibut specifically, as dosed by the users who are ordering it and using it.  Personally, I have been very surprised that such work has not been done yet - if only because the fluorinated Phenibut molecule is so simple to analyze as far as its absorption, target receptor selectivity, metabolism, etc.  (While not a priority at the moment, this work will be published, if only to put SOME kind of reference out there regarding the actual pharmacology of Flurophenibut, and its similarities to drugs like Phenibut, Baclofen, and Pregabalin.
 
 
One well-known nootropic research chemical supplier listed this in regard to Fluorophenibut’s activity and relative properties:
 
Quote
 
""F-Phenibut (Fluorophenibut) is a several-fold more potent derivative of Phenibut. Phenibut is an atypical anxiolytic and nootropic compound structurally similar to the well known inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, as well as to baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) and pregabalin (β-isobutyl-GABA)1. Phenibut was originally thought to act solely as a selective GABAB receptor agonist, similar to its much more potent relative baclofen, but has more recently been found to additionally act with somewhat higher affinity as an inhibitor of α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels, a mechanism of action shared with gabapentin and pregabalin.2 Phenibut is known to have a wider spectrum of effects than baclofen; for example Phenibut has been found to be more effective as a nootropic and neuroprotective compound than baclofen2,3, while baclofen has a more narrowly focused spectrum of effects and anecdotally shows a reduced tendency to induce habituation or tolerance to its effects upon chronic daily administration4. Preliminary (unpublished) research tentatively suggests that F-Phenibut (Fluorophenibut) has a behavioral potency of approximately five to tenfold higher than Phenibut in vivo, and may have proportionally severalfold higher affinity as a GABAB agonist than Phenibut, but may also retain comparable affinity and inhibitory efficacy at α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels, making F-Phenibut unique as an evenly balanced ligand for these two receptors. As an intermediary between Phenibut and baclofen, these findings hint at the potential promise that this p-fluoro relative of Phenibut might retain the broader nootropic, anxiolytic, and mood elevating characteristics of Phenibut, while simultaneously partially sharing the relatively reduced tolerance inducing properties of its p-chloro relative baclofen.""
 
First, this information states that Phenibut and Fluorophenibut are much more potent agonists than Phenibut itself, and while in one way that is somewhat true, the actual strength of the Baclofen and Fluorophenibut molecules are not much greater than Phenibut as agonists of the GABA -B Receptor, at all..
 
As far as binding affinity for the GABA -B Receptor, and agonist strength at the orthostatic (GABA) binding-site of the GABA -B Receptor, Phenibut, Baclofen, and Fluorophenibut are all pretty close, with the order of weakest to strongest (as far as binding affinity) going:
Phenibut (Ki: 112.02 nm) > Fluorophenibut (Ki: 99.04 nm) > Baclofen (Ki: 86.08 nm) 
 
And, their strength as agonists at the GABA -B Receptor from weakest to strongest goes:
Phenibut (w 82.11) > Fluorophenibut (w 161.12) > Baclofen (w 166.04)
 
So, why are smaller doses of Baclofen and Fluorophenibut so much stronger than equal weight doses of Phenibut? (After all, typical doses of Baclofen are 20mg, while typical Phenibut doses are 2000mg)! - This has everything to do with absorption, and very little to do with actual binding affinity for GABA Receptors or the compounds’ strength as agonists at GABA -B Receptor binding sites.  Phenibut is the endogenous GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) molecule, with the addition of a cyclic phenyl ring - which makes the molecule lipophillic (fate-soluble) enough to pass across the Blood-Brain-Barrier (which GABA itself does not).  However, the phenyl ring that is bound to the GABA molecule to form Phenibut is highly susceptible to metabolic cleavage via first-pass metabolism in the stomach and the gastrointestinal tract.  This cleaving of the phenyl ring off of the Phenibut molecule (yielding again plain GABA, which doesn’t cross the Blood-Brain-Barrier, and is simply excreted) ensures that only a small percentage or an oral dose of Phenibut is actually absorbed - where it possesses three major pharmacological mechanisms-of-action.  
 
1).  Phenibut acts as a highly selective agonist of the orthostatic (GABA) Binding Site of the GABA -B Receptor.  (While GABA itself has a plural-potentiality to bind at both GABA -A and GABA -B Receptors, the addition of the phenyl ring on the Phenibut molecule make the entire compound highly selective for the metabotropic GABA -B Receptor subtype over the ionotropic GABA -A Receptors).  2).  Phenibut binds to binding sites along a2o-suntype Voltage-Gated Ca+ Calcium Channels (like “gabapnetinoid” drugs, such as Gabapentin (“Neurontin”) and Pregnable (“Lyrica”) ) where it has an inhibitory action and calms the neurotransmission along these channels.  3).  Phenibut acts as an antagonist as TAAR1 (Trace Amine-Associated Receptors 1), where it blocks the binding of the endogenous, intermediate neurotransmitter B-Phenethylamine.  Phenethylamine is an intermediate neurotransmitter in mammals that is metabolized into the neurotransmitters L-DOPA, Dopamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Synephrine, and p-Octopamine.  It also serves as a chemical backbone for a class of synthetic chemicals known collectively as “the phenethylamines”, which includes amphetamines, substituted amphetamines, some cathinones, and some psychedelic, functional amphetamine substitutions - all drugs which agonize the TAAR1 Receptor, and induce anxiety.
 
In the case of Baclofen, we are dealing with the exact same molecule as Phenibut (the GABA molecule, with the addition of a cyclic phenyl ring), with only one tiny difference - the addition of a single halogen (in this case, a chloride) group on the para-position of the phenyl ring of the Phenibut molecule.  This simple addition of a single chloride atom significantly protects the Baclofen molecule from first-pass metabolism in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and allows much more of the compound to be absorbed intact.  Furthermore, the addition of the chloride atom on the compound’s phenyl ring negates almost all of the compound’s binding affinity for a2o-subunit-containing Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, and the addition of the chloride atom also negates the compound’s affinity for the TAAR1 Receptor.  This means that Baclofen functions almost solely as a selective and competitive agonist of the Orthosteric Binding-Site of the metabotropic GABA -B Receptor.
 
 
Now we have the emergence of another Phenibut derivative with the addition of a halogen group on the para-position of the phenyl ring (like Baclofen). However, rather than a chloride group, Fluorophenibut possesses a fluorine group on the para-position (^4) on the cyclic phenyl ring of the compound.
 
Now, theoretically, this should produce a compound that is much more similar to Baclofen than to Phenibut, and that is indeed the case.  Just like the chlorine group on the phenyl ring of Baclofen protects the compound against extensive first-pass metabolism in the gut, the fluorine atom of Fluorophenibut does exactly the same thing.  However, despite chlorine and fluorine groups both being halogens, a fluorine atom is slightly smaller (in terms of molecular weight, based on molarity) than a chlorine group (fluorine‘s atomic mass being 18.99 and chlorine‘s being 35.45), and possesses a slightly different polarity (fluorine groups possessing greater polarity than chlorine groups), which slightly changes the target selectivity of Fluorophenibut compared to Baclofen.  
 
Like with all three (Phenibut, Baclofen, and Fluorophenibut) compounds, the addition of the cyclic phenyl ring allows the compounds to be lipophillic enough to permeate the Blood-Brain-Barrier (and thus be centrally active).  The addition of the phenyl ring also makes all three compounds much more selective for the metabotropic GABA -B Receptor subtype of the ionotropic GABA -A Receptors.  In the case of Baclofen and Fluorophenibut (which both possess halogen groups on the para-positions on the compounds’ phenyl rings), the addition of the halogen groups negates the compounds’ affinity for a2o-subunit-containing Voltage-Gated Ca+ (Calcium) Channels to a large extent, and also negates the compounds’ binding affinity for the TAAR1 Receptors.  However, in the case of Fluorophenibut, which possesses a fluorine group in place of the chlorine group that Baclofen possesses, this compound retains some affinity for the TAAR1 Receptors (where it also acts as an antagonist, like Phenibut), and it also alters the overall polarity of the molecule enough that Fluorophenibut is the only one out of the bunch that possesses some degree of measurable affinity for the ionotropic GABA -A Receptors, in addition to its primarily action at metabotropic GABA -B Receptors.
 
The substitution of the chlorine group of Baclofen for the fluorine group of Fluorophenibut alters the overall polarity of the molecule because of the lessened molecular weight of the fluorine group (which in this case, functions as a hydrogen atom replacement) based on molarity, just enough to negate some of the GABA -B selectivity of the compound that is caused by the addition of its cyclic phenyl ring.  Although Fluorophenibut does absolutely function primarily as a selective GABA -B Receptor agonist, the drug also possesses some of the TAAR1 (Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1) that Phenibut possesses (where it acts as an antagonist, blocking the binding of endogenous phenethylamine).  In addition to this, the addition of the fluorine group on the Fluorophenibut molecule, which is lighter and has a higher polarity than Baclofen’s chlorine group, balances out some of the GABA -B Receptor selectivity that the presence of the compound’s cyclic phenyl ring affects the compound’s overall binding affinity - enabling the molecule to bind with some degree of weak affinity at the orthosteric binding site of the ionotropic GABA -A Receptor, which typical, much stronger GABA -A agonist drugs such as barbituates, methaqualone, meprobamate, and benzodiazepines, etc., bind to.
 
According to our projections as the result of our recent study, approximately 94.03% of orally-administered doses will be absorbed into blood plasma and make its way to the brain, and approximately 12.02% of the total oral dosage that is absorbed in humans will bind at the Orthosteric (GABA) Binding Site of the ionotropic GABA -A Receptor.  (Meaning that out of a 20mg oral dose, approximately 18.80mg will be absorbed into blood plasma and will cross the Blood-Brain-Barrier, and out of that 18.80mg that reaches the brain, approximately 2.25mg will bind at ionotropic GABA -A Receptors.
 
Because of these minor differences in Fluorophenibut’s target receptor selectivity over Phenibut and Baclofen, some degree of caution should be expressed towards anybody who is using or is considering using Fluorophenibut for any extended period of time, or alongside other GABAergic drugs which may produce a cumulative effect, or when used with other sedatives, regardless of action.
 
I have posted here several times regarding the use of Phenibut, and have designed and developed drugs that produce Phenibut as an active metabolite, are based on Phenibut’s chemical structure, or that function like Phenibut pharmacologically, and as I have said, although I do fully believe that Phenibut is a beneficial compound if used in a structured and controlled manner, and that it can absolutely be used responsibly, many users here have interjected their own experiences (either with what that have heard from others, or experienced themselves, regarding Phenibut withdrawal).  Although I know from experience that Phenibut withdrawal can be minimized and even all-together eliminated, based on my experience using Phenibut and similar compounds in clinical trial settings, if used excessively and/or stopped too abruptly, Phenibut (being a GABA agonist) can indeed cause a very unpleasant withdrawal syndrome, which can include rebound anxiety, depression, aches and pains, headache, insomnia, Restless Leg Syndrome, and a host of other symptoms. -  However, Phenibut, being a metabotropic GABA -B Receptor agonist, is not a drug that induces the severe tremors, convulsions, and even Grand Mal and Clonic seizures that many ionotropic GABA -A agonist drugs (such as barbituates, methaqualone, meprobamate, benzodiazepines, etc) can induce upon sudden withdrawal.  
 
However, in the case of Fluorophenibut, since some degree of ionotropic GABA -A Receptor activity is observed in in-vitro analyses, it should at least be speculated that some symptoms associated with ionotropic GABA -A Receptor agonist symptoms may be associated with the rapid withdrawal of Fluorophenibut, following regular, prolonged or excessive use.  
 
While we do not believe that Fluorophenibut possesses a physical dependency liability, or an abuse potential anywhere near the degree of the usual ionotropic, GABA -A Receptor agonists, and have concluded that like Phenibut and Baclofen - the main pharmacological action of Fluorophenibut responsible for its anxiolytic effect, is due to its selective and competitive affinity for the metabotropic GABA -B Receptors, where it acts as an agonist.  (As well as possibly due to some degree of antagonism of that TAAR1 Receptors, where Fluorophenibut, like Phenibut, blocks the binding of the brain’s endogenous B-phenethylamine.  Although, because some degree of ionotropic GABA -A Receptor affinity (12.02% of the oral dose absorbed) has been observed in in-vitro and in-vivo human models, it is worth mentioning that this activity may contribute to some increased degree of difficulty when withdrawing the drug following a regular dosage regimen, as well as potentially, an increased degree of risk when withdrawing Fluorophenibut following a regular, long-term dosage regimen. 
 
 
The following figures are the average binding affinity values and agonist-strength values for Fluorophenibut, compared to Phenibut and Baclofen, based on the recent set of analyses completed by Oracle Laboratories junior neurobiologist Adam Leustman (publication of these findings will follow, if only because almost nothing published exists regarding the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of Fluorophenibut), as well as previous studies conducted by Oracle Laboratories, regarding the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of related compounds and derivative compounds, that have previously been analyzed for prior projects.

I’m writing an English persuasive paper on treatments of mental illnesses using illegal drugs and other forms of non recreational therapy such as VR. I’ve found many resources on ketamine/depression, LSD, MDMA/ptsd and was wondering if the community had any other suggestion of articles or books that could be relevant to my topic. I’ve done a lot of research already but was just wondering if any of the community had any good topics or research studies I could look into. Thank you so much in advance for any guidance! "

"Paradoxical reaction of ADHD patients to stimulants
Patients with ADHD usually need a higher dose of a stimulant than a non-ADHD person in order to achieve the same effects.

It's true that stimulants have the EXACT SAME effect in both ADHD and non-ADHD people, but the effect is weaker in ADHD patients - for example, if X mg of a stimulant are needed to impair cognition, ADHD patients will require 1.5X mg of the same stimulant to impair their cognition (of course, the idea in ADHD is to use stimulants in [moderate doses that increase dopamine ONLY in the prefrontal cortex, where it's impossible for dopamine to create euphoria at all - the cognitive impairment comes from increases of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum which is only present in high doses of stimulants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16806100)).

So, for example, why does a normal person who takes 20 mg of a certain stimulant will feel energized, euphoric and his cognition will be temporarily impaired, while an ADHD person will feel only a very slight increase in energy but a greater increase in cognitive function? The ADHD person will have to take 30-40 mg of a stimulant to actually feel the same euphoria the normal person feels. 

Unfortunately, all I have for the subjective effects of the example doses is anecdotal evidence. If you've ever seen a person with ADHD on his stimulant medication, he'll tend to be calm and quiet - it is not an expected effect of stimulants and normal people who would take Amphetamine will usually become energized. Again, I got only anecdotal evidence here, as I've seen in myself and in others.

Now, shouldn't ADHD patients have a [higher D2High postsynaptic receptor density](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/20/12/4405.short)? The problem in ADHD patients is that dopamine is metabolized too quickly and therefore, postsynaptic dopamine receptors aren't activated long enough in order to focus on something (dopamine inhibits global brain activity in order to focus only on the strongest input, and that's exactly something that people with ADHD cannot do - they have ""noise"" in their brain. Dopamine kills that ""noise""). Since there is not enough activation of dopamine receptors, shouldn't dopamine receptors upregulate to compensate, and therefore the ADHD brain should be more sensitive to dopamine?

Indirect dopamine agonists (dopamine releasers such as Amphetamine and [Methylphenidate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953830)) are used to treat ADHD. Since they increase the amounts of dopamine, more receptor activation occurs, but still ADHD patients show a weaker response to these drugs than the normal population (and that is completely opposed to the fact ADHD patients should have more D2High receptors because they normally have low amounts of dopamine binding).

**TL;DR:** ADHD patients show a weaker response to stimulants than the general population, even though they are supposed to have a higher D2High postsynaptic receptor density because they normally have low dopamine binding (dopamine metabolism is too quick in ADHD patients).

Why does that paradoxical reaction occur?  "

""It is possible ALD-52 was the active chemical in the Orange Sunshine variety of LSD that was widely available in California through 1968 and 1969. The Sonoma County underground chemistry lab of Tim Scully and Nicholas Sand was Orange Sunshine's source. It was shut down by the police, and Scully was arrested and prosecuted. This resulted in the first drug analogue trial, where Scully claimed that he and his partners did nothing illegal, because they were producing ALD-52, which was not an illicit drug.""

"Fluorinated amphetamines (and phenethylamines): pharmacology of substances such as 2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA)
**PRELIMINARY NOTICE OF FORTHCOMING UPDATE** //12.8.14
*I apologize for my MIA status due to personal reasons, including an acquisition of a position at a research facility. I have some more information regarding these compounds, in particularly 2-FMA. I shall keep you guys posted in the next couple of days to come*

--------------

**If you have any questions or information (including anecdotes) regarding fluorinated phenethylamines (FP), such as 2-fluoromethamphetamine, then please contribute!**

--------------

Given the molecular simplicity of stimulants in general, the RC scene has been booming with a plethora of novel compounds that people have been experimenting with on a daily basis. Research chemicals should be tread with caution due to their inherent lack of information, however I want us to attempt plausible speculations on their pharmacological profile (particularly their pharmacodynamics) based on the information out there and personal experimentation due to the widespread usage of such compounds. 

*I find the fluorine substitution of existing drugs such as amphetamines in particular to be of great interest to me. 2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA) and 2-Fluoroamphetamine (2-FA) are two particular compounds that I want to reveal more information about due to their increasing availability, pharmacological profiles, and repetitive dosing for its functional use.* The majority of scholarly articles out there regarding fluorinated phenethylamines precede the current decade or discuss the effects of other halogenated phenethylamines that are in no way relatable to the substitution of fluorine due to its unique moiety. 

From the the abstract of the article ""Fluorine in psychedelic phenethylamines"":
*""It was shown that the introduction of fluorine into the phenethylamine nucleus can impact greatly on psychoactivity of these compounds, ranging from marked loss to enhancement and prolongation of effects. For example, in contrast to the psychoactive escaline (70), it was observed that its fluoroescaline (76) counterpart was almost devoid of psychoactive effects. Difluoroescaline (77), on the other hand, retained, and trifluoroescaline (78) showed increased human potency of escaline (70). Difluoromescaline (72) and trifluoromescaline (73) increasingly surpassed human potency and duration of mescaline (22) effects.""*

I just recently obtained access to this article and will be reading it soon, but from just reading the abstract I find such properties of fluorine substitution to be incredibly interesting. Personally, I've been dosing 2-FMA and/or 2-FA on a weekly basis since the beginning of this year to assist me in my academia and have noticed symptoms - of those that aren't specifically mentioned online - such as urinary retention with 2-FMA. Doses of 2-FMA around the 100mg+ range result in minor and temporary nystagmous (eye wiggles). 

**If you are consistently dosing yourself with fluorinated RCs, particularly with alkyl fluoride substituents, then I'd be careful because an excess of fluorine (from possible metabolites) that may lead to diseases such as skeletal fluorosis. Also, elimination of fluorine from body is a very long process!** Let's hope that the majority of fluorinated RCs out there don't result in acute toxicity as is in the case of methoxyflurane.

-------------


**Some information known so far regarding FPs and fluorine (may not be entirely correct):**

-Fluorination of a position on the phenyl ring leads to greater lipophilicity, which in turn is supposed to increase the bioavailability and duration of the drug.

-Despite the greater lipophilicity, FPs have been known to have a slower onset of action (e.g. 2-FA vs amphetamine, why is this though?)

-Aryl fluorides (hydrogen substituted for a fluorine on a phenyl substituent) are largely excreted unchanged from the body

-Aryl fluoride compounds are suspect to cardiotoxicity through the prolongation of the QT wave (3).

-Fluoride's retention rate: ""Approximately, fifty percent of absorbed fluoride is excreted renally with a twenty four hour period. The remainder can be retained in the oral cavity, and lower digestive tract. Fasting dramatically increases the rate of fluoride absorption to near hundred percent, from a sixty to eighty percent when taken with food."" (1)

-Methoxyflurane (*not an aryl fluoride*) is not in the class of phenethylamines, however this anesthetic has been extensively researched and concluded to result in a dose-dependent nephrotoxicity due to its metabolization into DCA and fluoride following O-demethylation. ""This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared."" (2) 

-Fluoride ions in the body can react with HCl in the stomach to form hydrofluoric acid (HF), which adversely interacts with the calcium and magnesium ions in the body.

-(will format and expand upon later)...

--------------

**Some questions that I personally have include:**

-What specific specific enzyme(s) metabolize FPs?

-Is there anyone with results to a urine test regarding the metabolization of FPs?

-Could these FPs metabolize into perfluorinated compounds (PFCs)? (Given that PFCs persist in the body for years and can induce nephrotoxicity) *with the exception of aryl fluoride compounds due to being excreted largely changed from the body*

-Are there any studies regarding the negative surrogate measures regarding the amount of FPs within the body?

-Is there any recent data regarding the binding site affinity of FPs for any receptors in the body?

-Bioavailability of various FPs?

-etc...

I can fully understand the desire to learn more about the substances you are, or want to take whether for safety or just general curiosity. However everyone seems to be hung up on the idea that you need to learn ""organic chemistry"". What you are in fact looking for is **Pharmacology**. Organic chemistry is the study of molecules involving carbon, with a lot of emphasis on their reactivity with the goal of synthesizing new molecules. In 99% of cases this knowledge will have no usefulness to a recreational user of a drug. No one who is having to read guides to organic chemistry online will be synthesizing drugs beyond a cold water extraction or a DMT tek.

Pharmacology however is the study of drug activity. This is the useful stuff. It certainly requires a very basic understanding of chemistry and biology but is far more relevant to recreational drug use. So instead of trying to name hydrocarbons, or wrap your head around nucleophillic attack go and read about neurons, action potentials, molecule receptors and cellular mechanics. "

"WTF is Baclofen? And why is it inducing constant hypomania/euphoria?
What the hell is this thing? I suffer from severe muscle spasms and as a result I got prescribed this Baclofen (tradename Lioresal).

I've been taking the two doses combined (50mg) for the past few days at night right before sleep time, that is to avoid any sort of compulsive sedation/drowsiness. The good news is that I woke up next morning fully refreshed, with my muscle spasms almost fully gone. Shockingly, I also noticed how scary good my mood have become, to the point that everything I had a glimpse over could only conceive as positive, intriguingly compelling, regardless of how silly or trivial it actually is.

I couldn't make myself think negative at all, I was overly fucking happy, that I frankly started to feel a bit concerned. For the most part, I felt that life has finally become so damn easy to understand, my understanding of logic and level of consciousness were very much heightened -- I thought I knew it all. Everything was totally smooth. Felt energetic, scarily smart, charming and exceedingly witty, with a genuine sense of sarcasm. Confidence was remarkably elevated. For what it's worth I was finally able to feel the positives of caffeine. Very weird.

I thought I could solve any problem there is. Anxiety was wiped out and switched by supreme optimism/calmness. The first day I was fully fucking aware that this isn't normal, and that all will fade out the next time. Well much to my surprise, the effects for the next three days were overwhelmingly pronounced, even more than what I described the first day, to the point that I woke up this morning and started uncontrollably crying of how happy I was feeling. WTF IS THIS? I had this random thought: why would someone try to get high of some obscure chemical if a stupid muscle relaxing medicine can make you feel that good?

"Sublingual Methylphenidate Tincture
I came up with this idea yesterday (and tried it) and while I’m sure it’s been done before I couldn’t find anything on the usual forums. I tried it out and it exceeded my expectations so I wanted to share it. Please let me know what you think.


Rational (it’s a bit rambly, so feel free to skip to the recipe):
I have been prescribed ritalin and concerta for about 4 years. Not long after i started taking it i quickly discovered the benefits of snorting crushed up pills (faster onset, more controllable dosing, stronger effects, the initial rush, etc.) In high school i only snorted ritalin occasionally when working on a particularly demanding assignment (or occasionally for recreational effects while drinking). 
I now attend an incredibly academically rigorous university 
 and soon after beginning I began snorting  ritalin every day. Inhaling large amounts of powder into one’s sinuses is not a sustainable habit if you wish to retain an intact, functioning nasal cavity, so i started plugging pills. While i found plugging to be even more effective and less physiologically destructive compared to snorting, it is obviously a relatively messy, impractical, and time consuming process. After two semesters of near daily plugging, I began to search for alternatives, as I no longer have a bathroom in my dorm room, and working in a lab 9-5 makes the timing more difficult. 
Aside from IV, the only other ROA i could think of was sublingual. Pouring several pills worth of powder into your mouth and trying to hold it in to allow it to dissolve before swallowing it is relatively difficult, and while some immediate effects are felt,  it is significantly less effective than snorting or plugging (in terms of quicker onset, increased BA, etc) due to swallowing. 
After reading that using mouthwash before sublingual ritalin increases absorption, i did some research and got an idea. Ethanol (21% of typical mouth wash) is quickly absorbed through the mucous membranes and seems to increase sublingual absorption of drugs ( https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.3030440710 ).
Ethanol is also a better solvent of methylphenidate (specifics below). These two facts gave me the idea to dissolve ritalin in ethanol (or vodka, as it was what was available, and pure ethanol is nasty stuff) and put the solution in an eyedropper to allow for controlled, quick, and effective dosing.


Recipe:

10 x 10 mg ritalin pills, finely crushed 
~ 5-7 mL vodka (40% ethanol) 

Mixed crushed ritalin with vodka and filtered through paper towel (bad idea, too absobant and easily torn, will use coffee filter next time). Rinsed filter with a little more vodka. Poured solution into empty, clean eye drop bottle.


Back of the envelope calculations:

Methylphenidate HCl is more soluble in ethanol (29 mg/mL) than water (18 mg/mL) so i roughly calculated the solubility in vodka to be ~20 mg/mL and went for a ratio of 5 mL vodka for 100mg methylphenidate. The actual concentration is probably a little lower than that because i rinsed my paper towel filter with an extra couple mL because it was so absorbent. An eyedropper (e.g. visine) dispenses about 0.05 mL per drop so each drop should contain ~1 mg methylphenidate. 

Results:

I was surprised at how effective this actually was. Applying 5-10 drops at a time under my tongue and holding it in my mouth (not swallowing) for a minute or two felt incredibly similar to plugging (better than snorting) an equivalent amount. Obviously I repeated the process until i reached my desired dose. 
Surprisingly, the initial rush was stronger than anything i had experienced with ritalin. An immediate wave of euphoria hit me with the first few drops, dare i say reminiscent of smoking a small amount of crack (admittedly my experience with crack is quite limited and i am a bit biased, but the onset was incredibly quick).


Conclusion:

Sublingual use of an ethanol based methylphenidate tincture is definitely a practical, effective, and (relatively) safe way to consume methylphenidate with an onset, rush, and BA comparable, and imo better, to those of snorting and plugging. It is likely possible to do the same wikth amphetamine and other recreational pills. I highly recommend this ROA. "

"Testosterone, estrogen, ketamine, lateral habenula (anti-reward center), and depression relief
This is preliminary, and based on personal experience and a hunch, though I do relatively strongly believe that there is something to it. Hunch is based on a preliminary study that ketamine relieves depression due to suppression of brain anti-reward center, lateral habenula. So, a hypothesis I want to share: **both estrogen and ketamine might relieve depression via suppression of lateral habenla**.

To do away with testosterone, it is known to relieve depression for some people, but it's only relevant in this hypothesis because it elevates estrogen levels in the body via aromatization. That's the only reason why it's relevant here. 

Now, here are two relevant studies:

* https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25509#acknowledgements - Ketamine blocks bursting in the lateral habenula to rapidly relieve depression
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082062 - Estradiol suppresses neuronal firing activity and c-Fos expression in the lateral habenula.

And here is some more information about estrogen and depression, which I think is extraordinarily interesting. It started me thinking about all this. It's about link between higher than in men rates of depression in women, and several pretty compelling studies which show rapid relief of particular types of depression with estrogen in women. 

* https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1c7i6g/doctors_of_reddit_can_you_explain_why_the_medical/

To end this post, I want to share my own experience. For me testosterone replacement therapy is the only intervention that works, albeit not completely. Though I have persistent cognitive and other issues due to years of antidepressant drug usage, so maybe it's the reason why TRT doesn't work fully. Anyway. I tired to use small dose oral estrogen formulation (estradiol valerate, because in studies bioidentical version was shown to be most effective), to test the hypothesis that it's estrogen which is important, and it worked. I noticed that most of the effect is short-lived, but if I take more estradiol valerate, it repeats. It looks like this has something to do with changing levels of estradiol in blood, not only total levels. Also for several hours after taking an estrogen pill, I get very powerful emotional effect which feels really good. I was able to repeat it by taking more estrogen.

---

P.S. there was recently some information that it's actually ketamine metabolite hydroxynorketamine what relieves depression, and that it's not an NMDA-antagonist, and that can be used as an objection to the study about ketamine and lateral habenula. But this is not true. I've just looked into it, and well, HNK action is *not* NMDA-independent:

>In summary, our data demonstrate that (2R,6R)-HNK inhibits
synaptic NMDARs, which subsequently triggers intracellular signalling
previously proposed to underlie the antidepressant effects
of ketamine as well as (2R,6R)-HNK. These data argue against
the premise that (2R,6R)-HNK acts in an NMDAR-independent
manner and instead shows that (2R,6R)-HNK is an open-channel
blocker of NMDARs. These data indicate that blocking NMDAR is
the likely effect of (2R,6R)-HNK in antidepressant action. Ketamine
has a relatively short half-life and yet can exert long-lasting
antidepressant effects2
. We propose that (2R,6R)-HNK, through
inhibition of NMDARs, may explain the longer-lasting antidepressant
effects of ketamine that are not observed by other NMDAR
blockers. https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2017210

"CBD is apparently a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Thoughts on safety of taking it with irreversible blood thinner Apixaban, which is partially metabolized by CYP3A?
[I was surprised to learn it's an inhibitor of these enzymes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189631/)

I assume that at low dosages of 10-20 CBD per day, it would be safe given that Eliquis (apixaban) is metabolized by (according to a few sources I found, and averaged out):

 - CYP3A4 (Main pathway: ~25%)
 - CYP3A5
 - CYP1A2 
 - and others
 - Urinary excretion (~30%)

[According to DrugBank.ca CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism, and 25% of the drug is excreted unmetabolized.](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB06605)

Anyone have any thoughts on this? 10-20mg of CBD is a rather low dosage, and there are additional modes of metabolizing apixaban, but CBD inhibits at least one of them too.

Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** Some additional info. P-glycoprotein is possibly the method for urinary excretion of apixaban, and CBD does not appear to inhibit it at relevant doses.

Apixaban dosage is 5mg 2x daily, which is the standard dose. FDA recommends dosage reductions to 2.5mg with concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors which makes me think it's quite possibly unsafe, even at a low dose."

"Formulas for calculating drug elimination times to negligable levels. (Xpost: /r/drugs)
I like math and drugs so I am going to tell you guys how to precisely and simply calculate when it is safe to dose dxm on SSRIs for example, figure out how long your withdraw will last, and if you can safely consume a drug before a drug test

So many of you guys are probably familiar with the concept of a half-life. That is, the time it takes for half of a dose of a certain drug to leave your system. A false assumption to make would be that multiplying the half life by 2 will give the time it takes for a drug dose to completely leave your system, or elimination time. This is wrong because the function for drugs leaving your body is not linear, in fact it decreases exponentially.

The law of natural growth/decay, and in our case decay is given by

D(t)=Ce^kt

Where D(t) is dose in your body as a function of time t. e Is euler's number, k is some positive constant, and C is the starting dose. You can see why because when t=0,

D(t)=Ce^0=C*1=C.

For our case however we are going to regard it as the law of natural decay and change the equation to,

D(t)=Ce^-kt so it decreases exponentially.

Now all you need to understand this and calculate what you want is algebra that I am going to teach you, but I am also going to talk about concepts of calculus and it is ok if you don't know.

This equation D(t) comes from the general solution to the differential equation,

dD/dt=kD

where dD/dt is the instantaneous rate of change of drug in the system with respect to time elapsed. This equation says that the rate of change of the drug in the system is proportional to the current current amount of drugs in the body. We know that the solution is D(t)=Ce^kt because, taking the derivative of D(t),

D'(t)=k(Ce^kt)=kD

So at this point perhaps you are wondering what the hell k is and how we figure it out. The answer is we have to solve for it to find the ultimate answer to our question. Perhaps we know the original dose, adjusted for bioavailability, which is how much of the drug actually gets used in the body. You can easily find bio-availability percentages online, if a research chemical you might have to extrapolate one from scholarly data if they even have that. Perhaps we also know the half-life, which again can be found on google. And of course we know the time t since we took the drug. Or for ultra sensitive calculations at the peak plasma level just as the drug levels start to decrease, but you probably won't need to worry about that. From this we can form an equation.

C/2=Ce^-kt

This makes sense because the half life is the time it takes for approximately half of the starting dose C to deplete from the body, so we set D(t)=C/2. Dividing both sides by C we get,

1/2=e^-kt

Where we make t in this case equal to the half-life.

Some of you may recall that the inverse of the exponential function ex is it's natural logarithm, ln x. A logarithm is ""the number you have to raise the base of the logarithm to the power to, to get to the subject of the logarithm."" A natural logarithm (ln) is base e, so what number do you have to raise e to the power to to get ln(e-kt)? Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,

ln(1/2)=ln(e^-kt)

ln(1/2)=-kt

Dividing by -t,

ln(1/2)/-t=k

Using a calculator, k, like I said will equal some positive constant, probably a really long decimal, but now that we know k, we can figure out the rest of the equation D(t). We simply have to plug back in k into D(t)=Ce^-kt, and that will give you the amount of drugs in your body at any time t.

 In order to figure out at what time the drugs are gone, at least to a negligable level, we have to set D(t) close to zero, but not at zero because the equation doesn't work then. I will let you investigate why if you want.

For example lets say we want our amount of drugs to be 0.1. Making use of the constant k we just solved for,

0.1=Ce^-kt

0.1/C=e^-kt

Ln(0.1/C)=-kt

Ln(0.1/C)/-k=t

So t will be the time when the drug amount is at that level.
One thing to note is that the function changes for continuous dosing. Say you dose an SSRI daily and you are wondering when it will complete its elimination time when you stop taking it. You would first need to question whether or not the doses stack after each day in the case that the complete elimination time is longer than the interval between each dose. Fortunately, mathematics can provide us an answer. In biology/ecology there is a concept called carrying capacity, which says that after a certain population limit of a species, the rate of growth will approach zero. This is a similar concept in pharmacology, where the amount of drugs in a system after a certain time of continuously dosing approach a constant number, which is akin to saying the rate of change in total drugs in the system is zero because d/dx(c), where c of some constant, is 0. Most medically prescribed drugs and probably a lot of illicit ones have data showing the limit or carrying capacity so to speak, of total amount of drugs in your system and after how many days of dosing it takes to get there.

If you do dose daily and you can find these statistics then you will set C, starting dose, equal to not how much of the drug you take a day, but equal to the ""limit"" or ""carrying capacity"", of your drug. Time t=0 will represent when you last took the dose.

I hope you all enjoyed and learned something and I hope you find use for this next time you need it. If you have a question or need help with a calculation please leave a comment and perhaps I can clear it up for you.

"Psychedelics: a review by David E. Nichols (2016)
"
"Why are reuptake inhibitors usually not neurotoxic, but releasing agents are?
Monoamine releasers, specifically Amphetamine, is known to [damage dopaminergic pathways when given in high doses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17606768).

Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, such as Methylphenidate, [lack the neurotoxic properties of Amphetamine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9365033). Methylphenidate is actually neuroprotective.

From what I've understood, the main mechanism of neuron damage caused by Amphetamine is because Amphetamine leads to a massive release of monoamines, which then get oxidized by MAO enzymes. The oxidation of the massive amounts of these monoamines then leads to oxidative stress which harms neurons.

Why doesn't that oxidative stress damage happen with NDRIs such as Methylphenidate? If Methylphenidate is a reuptake inhibitor, then it means the neurotransmitter cannot return to the vesicles through the transporters when Methylphenidate acts in the brain. So since these neurotransmitters cannot be reuptaken, the only thing that can be done to reduce their amount is oxidation by MAO. Logically, their oxidation will lead to oxidative stress which would harm cells.

This works logically, but still, Methylphenidate is not neurotoxic at all while Amphetamine is. Why, if both of them force oxidation and cause oxidative stress, Amphetamine is the only one which is neurotoxic?

**TL;DR:** Amphetamine's main mechanism of neurotoxicity is the oxidative stress caused by the massive release of monoamines. Methylphenidate also leads to high concentrations of monoamines but still isn't neurotoxic (even though they have to oxidize because DAT & NET are blocked). By this logic, Methylphenidate induces oxidative stress - so why isn't it neurotoxic in the same way Amphetamine is, then?

"Just found out sponsee od'ed and died
I had only worked with her for a short while and due to various circumstances we had just met once or twice and talked on the phone a few times. Mostly I am shocked and sad. She was young, early twenties. I hadn't heard from her in about two weeks and suspected that she had gone out again. Went on Facebook to try and track her down and that was when I saw the news in comments on her profile. I do know that she had struggled with feeling like she could have one last hurrah before committing to sobriety, which had led to multiple relapses over the past year before I met her. What I don't know is why some of us get this and others don't, and while I usually can sit with the uncertainty of not knowing that, tonight it's a little harder to accept.

"18 years of saving my life, 1 day at a time.
18 years ago today I walked into a room of recovery. There was a man sitting at a table, doing some paper work. I told him why I was there and he proceeded to to share with me his experience with alcohol. He gave me a list of 20 questions and told me to answer them to myself....said he did not need to know what my answers were. After glancing over them, it looked like I was in the right place.
I have not had a drink of alcohol from that day. What I have done is participated in a set system of directions that has helped me to form a new way of thinking...I changed my mind about some things. When I was able to change my mind, I became able to change my behaviors......imagine that.
There are to many people to thank. Many more have now passed away. Many are just lost to time and distance. No matter where they are, I will tell you that I did not recover from a trashed out liver and a hopeless state of mind without them. 
I humbly asked God to remove my obsession for alcohol. I tell you that God answered that prayer. I am a walking miracle. I also tell you that he used recovering drunks and drug addicts as the tools to save me. He even used some that had to die to get clean. 

This post is dedicated to those who have carried me until I could walk, and then helped me to trudge the path of happy destiny. For you I am grateful.

"6 months today!
I finally reached the half-year mark. Haven't been sober for that long ever since I began using. The intriguing part of this is that I had an extremely vivid using dream this morning. In it, I had relapsed right before reaching my 6 month mark and chose to keep it a secret even from my sponsor and even picked up the chip knowing I didn't deserve it. I continued working the program but kept using occasionally until i returned to my full blown addict lifestyle while still keeping the whole thing under wraps, afraid of what would happen if others had found it I was a sham. It was so realistic that I woke up terrified, thinking I had legitimately relapsed only to realize that it was all just a dream after a good 15 seconds. Then it came to me that today's my 180th day clean and I felt rejuvenated. Can't help but think that there was some sort of significance to that dream, some sort of message from my Higher Power that I can't comprehend very well. Anyways, feeling quite glad despite the scariness I experienced this morning and excited to pick up that chip, knowing I deserved it. Thanks for reading."

One year clean on nov 14. I wake up so happy every day to begin a new day. I’m constantly smiling at work and outside work. This feels really really good to be clean. My first time clean since 07.  Cleaning up the wreckage of my past is getting easier and easier and most importantly it’s getting done. Pink cloud or not, I feel so happy. The fellowship is my way of life now. 

On the flip coin, my life is still unmanageable. I want to sleep very little so I get more time to do all the things I want to do. I account for every hour of the day. I can never watch an TV. I have an inherent fear of going back to active addiction. I hit the gym 6 days a week and I obsess about missing one day.

I'm still facing consequences of my using/drinking but I know that this takes time.  Things don't happen over night but I know that this is the only way for me.

I went into an outpatient rehab program that eventually got me plugged into AA. Since then, I went back to school and finished my degree, found a steady job, met the girl, and got engaged. My life is completely different now than when I was drinking and using. I'm very grateful to be here and to be sober. I have responsibilities in places I didn't even know existed. People can depend on me. My family can rely on me. 
I just want to say that if you're new, keep coming back. Things do materialize if we work for them. I hope everyone has a safe and sober 2016! May the blessings be. "
"3 years sober today
Today I have 3 years sober. 3 years ago I was drinking alone watching a movie (Unguarded - Chris Herren Story) which changed my life. In that movie a man was living selfishly through drugs, alcohol, women, etc. At one point he was passed out with homeless men, I said (to the TV), “That’s pathetic”, then I paused and said “Oh wait, that’s you Justin”. A feeling of disgrace came through my body at 2am, I cried from shame, but then a feeling of relief and joy because I told myself “You don’t have to live like that anymore”. I haven’t had a drink since.
From that day, I decided to become the man I admire. It’s been hard work, very hard, but the old me had to die for the new one to live. Some of you know my journey and I’ll tell you from day 1 in sobriety it has been therapy (to fix the issues that caused the drinking), being around other sober and positive folk (people, places, things), volunteering (my humility led me to give back), mentoring (giving one on one yields the best gratitude). From the 1st day I created my own rules and I do not negotiate the integrity of that ethos. I don’t go to bars, because I don’t belong there...it's simply not interesting to me.
3 years later what do I have? An amazing wife (before I was incapable of love or being loved), 2 amazing twin daughters (I can give them the love I never received growing up). My financial status is great (before I was borrowing money to support my habits)- I’m now closing on a new beautiful house next month for my family (when I was drinking I sometimes lived in a garage). Also in 3 years, I’ve learned a language, become a published author, been syndicated as a writer, dedicated myself to boxing, over 300 volunteer/mentoring efforts, and most importantly held my head high and proud of the man I see in the mirror (my drinking helped with self-worth, social anxiety, and many things that related to me not accepting me - that's because I didn't like who I was).
If you felt humility through this thread, that’s’ because it’s there, and I feel it every day. I changed my behavior that changed my life. The life I have now is way better than the life I had before, therefore my old ways are simply not interesting to me at all…and I think that is the secret to change/recovery…create a better life than the one you had. My life is simple, I do only a few things, but I do those things exceptionally. Some might believe addiction is a disease, but I believe the mind is powerful enough to re-wire and learn new behaviors if one is willing to put in the work - this is because I believe in the essence of the human spirit and our capacity to be amazing people. You are amazing, did you know that? If not, read this thread again. The chill you feel in your body is your potential..follow that, it's honest, it will guide you correctly.
Share this with anyone who might feel inspired to become their better self. Today is my “re-birth day” I'm not perfect, but i'm perfect for the people I'm meant for...and they love that I'm recovered....one day at a time.

hi guys i don't know if i've ever made a topic here but my sober date is 12/19/12 and life has been pretty decent since.

i spent some time with my friend who had been sober a month or two before me but relapsed last month and has been struggling since. tonight he called me. said he used today. agreed to meet him for coffee. on the phone he said he was considering going to a long term treatment. 

we get to talking and all i hear are the reasons why he cant go, 'what he'll lose' and all of this stuff. it's easy to sympathize with but i had to remember, this is the disease talking. this is the disease trying to keep this guy right where he is, trying to keep him stuck from taking action. trying to keep him in his thoughts to figure this thing out. 

we hear so many slogans and cute little catch phrases and over time i learn what they truly mean.

the disease talks to us and to others in our own voice. it tells us all the sound logical reasons why we cant. it tells us how we're going to figure this out and be ok. it tells us that goddamn lie that we can still go on doing what we've been doing.

I'll share a little of my experience in recovery.

Some people see the light and other people feel the heat. I felt the heat. I started going to NA meetings not because ""I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired,"" but to get a piece of paper signed.

""The miracle"" or ""spiritual awakening"" they talk about I always thought would be some burning bush epiphany. In fact it's more like a tree growing. At some time a seed gets planted and with enough water, it slowly grows. I can't point to the day on the calendar when I became honest or when I decided to work steps. I look back and the change was slow. That's why it's so important for me to keep coming back.

For a while, I was getting the probation slip signed and leaving after the meeting but what people were saying had an impact on me. Then a group I was regularly attending held a home group camp-out/float trip. I went on the trip and was amazed. It was the first time being clean that I had fun and made friends. That trip was the catalyst for my personal program of recovery. I was going to meetings for myself and because I had friends there and was comfortable.

I got a sponsor who is really big into unity. We'll go to meeting in East Bumfuck and he knows multiple people there. They guy's base and network is huge. The relationship I have with my sponsor today was created with a foundation of honesty. I share everything with my sponsor and my sponsor has given me more guidance in my life than anyone ever has. I have started working steps and the program has changed my life.

Home group, fellowship, sponsorship, and steps. Those are the tools of my program and I only get so far not utilizing them ALL.

Blew all my money. Lost job. Homeless, Stole from friends and family. Lost everyone and everything. Finally fed up and did not want to die. Checked self into rehab. While in rehab friends and family pressed charges for stuff I did. Turned self in after completing rehab. Spent 6 months in county jail. Finally got GED in jail (did not even need to study, and IDK why I never did, just afraid of failure I guess). Dodged 5 years in DOC. Now I made the decision to follow a dream apparently years in the making. I start school the 2nd week in March. Bachelor of Science in Counseling with an Emphasis in Addiction, Chemical Dependency, and Substance Abuse. Friends and family are all coming back into my life. Super proud of me. Everyday I hear from someone that they knew I had something special inside of me and how happy they are that I am finally at peace.

I am super excited because I genuinely want to help more people at a different level than I am now. I am currently a Peer Support Specialist for the same halfway house that helped me after treatment. But I want to get deeper into helping others lives. I want to help them and their families.

If anyone can learn anything from my story is that it IS POSSIBLE to come back from the depths of despair. The main reason I became Peer Support is because I felt that I threw my whole life away and became a loser and would never amount to anything ever again. One person helped me see that my life was not over, I just needed to want to build that ladder to pull myself out of the hole I dug myself into. He really helped save me and I will forever be grateful.

TLDR: addiction helped me lose everything; Now going to school to be a counselor to help other addicts find their peace.

"65 days sober from IV heroin addiction
I’m working a 12 step program, have a sponsor, and regularly attend meetings. BUT I’m quickly losing that feeling I had in the beginning. I’m feeling so fucking empty and spiritually bankrupt. Things in my life are going great and getting better day by day. I just for some reason can’t get right in my head. I do everything groups, sponsors, others tell me to do, I practice the principles of my 12 step, I maintain a daily conscious contact with my higher power, yet I still feel like I’m doing everything wrong. I feel like I’m completely backtracking in my recovery in every possible aspect. I KNOW I can’t go back to using, and don’t intend on it, but fuckkkkk this feeling, I can’t shake it."
"3 months Clean Today!!
First 3 months clean since I started using. I feel like I have been 'reborn'. I'm able to feel life again. Still battling mild symptoms. Getting through it all. I'm cleaning up my life and it seems really tough at times but I'm doing it CLEAN. It's a lot easier this way. And I have hope, one of the many things I never had while using. "

"[Feeler]- Looking to start a young peoples AA/NA recovery subreddit
I did a search on reddit, expecting to find a young peoples AA group exploding with people...but I couldn't find anything.

So I had the idea of starting a young peoples recovery subreddit for us to have general discussion, and new young people that want some information on how recovery works, mainly AA and NA based.

I'm a 26 yr old male, been in recovery for years now. My friends and I just started a local young peoples meeting with fellowship in our biggest nearby city. Within the first meeting we had around 35+ people! We were really not expecting that! It was the first young peoples meeting in that city, and we go out each night of the meeting and have planned activities. We get to have fun and experience recovery at the same time.

I want to try and bring that to reddit. Us young folk are on computers and cell phones all the time. I was fortunate enough to get into several rehabs and sober houses, but lots of new guys/gals don't have the resources around them to get an accurate view of recovery and AA/NA, so I would like to be able to bring that to them.

Still building up karma to start the subreddit, and I still want to do planning before I open it. If you are interested in helping set up this subreddit, please PM me so we can talk about it. I can provide my cell phone, email, and what not. I would like the subreddit to be a wealth of helpful discussion and information**


#Edit:

"Today we share 3 years clean.
I just picked up my keytag at a meeting and went out to dinner to celebrate this miracle with some close friends. My heart is full of gratitude... I hear it said often in meetings, but if I could have written down what I wanted my life to look like at 3 years clean when I first came around, I would have been selling myself way short. I'm so blessed to have been given the opportunity to recover from addiction and to find a new way to live through working the steps of narcotics anonymous. I am so grateful that our predecessors have shown me how to suit up and show up, and they loved me until I could love myself. In the Living Clean book it says, ""what we find is not that our higher power spares us the hardships of life, but that it gives us the grace to walk through them clean."" That is the single most important thing that I've learned in my recovery... life happens, and it always will, but I don't have to be a victim anymore. 

Thank you for my recovery."
"32 years of gratitude
32 years today, quitting drinking and joining AA was the best decision I have ever made. The best lesson to date is; if alcoholism doesn't leave us in 30 years, why would it leave us in 30 days. Don't drink, trust God, clean house, help others p. Thanks all."
"I turn 21 tomorrow. Sober.
Welp. HERE IT IS! The day I have been dreading since the day I put the plug in the jug and took the pipe out of my mouth! 3 years and 9 months have lead to tomorrow. 

It has always been a big ""Problem"" for me in recovery And I am realizing now, that it will just be another 24 hours.

When I got sober at age 17 I considered my life to be over and that there was no hope of ever living a normal life. Yet, this year I purchased gifts for everyone in my family. Most ""Normal People"" do that, right? I hold an amazing job and show up ever day. Normal? I am working on Christmas Day. A lot of normality here! For me it is so out of the Norm and it feels so good to be living in the LIGHT. 

I always dreaded my 21st birthday wondering ""What am I supposed to do?"" ""I have to drink!"" But today I don't want that. I am gonna do what I want to do! My first sponsor always told me that I have the world by the balls and I can make what I want with it. So, I will be attending an Improv Show in Boston with my family because that is where I want to be...with my family that loves me no matter what. After the show it will be dinner and Coca-Cola's on the rocks. And then it is off to NECYPAA in Rhode Island to see old friends and meet some new ones. Now that is a 21st Birthday!

If you are struggling with alcohol or drugs and feel alone today just know that I am here with you. Love.

P.S I work as an EMT and find it kind of ironic that I was thinking about this post this morning on my way to work and the first call we had was a intoxicated old man. Different sides of the spectrum and really made me grateful for where I am at today.

"You know what's more important than cakeday?
Today I celebrate one year sober thanks to the program of AA and figuring out how to tap into a Higher Power that works for me.  Through that year I've dealt with the suicide of a close friend, the dissolution of a marriage of 16 years, the sale of a house, and setting up a whole new life and lifestyle.  I am 44 now and used alcohol and drugs since I was 16 with never more than a few days break under my own willpower.  For me the trick was attending meetings, following the steps, working with a sponsor, working with sponsees, and learning true humility and gratitude.  I loved to think I was the center of the world and the boss of everything in it.  Giving that up to follow the program of AA and the advice of my sponsor while adopting a willingness to believe in bigger things than myself have saved me from certain death, at least for another 24 hours.

I share this with you all only to add another voice to the chorus that if you are looking for a way out, you CAN do it.  You don't have to live in addiction even one more day.  There is a solution."

I haven't had a drink in 2 weeks, and it feels good. **I** feel good. I hadn't gone 2 *days* without drinking in at least ten years, so 2 weeks is huge for me. Tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and not drink again. Thanks for letting me share."

"It works
Today I have been clean for 28 years. DO NOT BE IMPRESSED. 

I am a habitual fuck-up. Its my gift, my skill, my calling in life. Inthe last 28 years I have been arrested, I have been fired, I haved destroyed more relationships than I can count, I have fucked up my life and I have fucked up others lives. I did everything wrong except one thing. I didnt use.

Reflecting back, 28 years was no harder than 27 years or 26 years. You want to know whats hard? Whats hard is 90 days. 90 days is a long fucking time. I was acutely aware of every minute of those first 90 days, if not every second.

28 years just happens. It happens by doing the same shit you did to get 90 days. Don't use - just for today. The 27 years and 364 days prior to this one are history and don't mean a fucking thing if I should use today.

I didn't do this by myself. All of you who ever gave recovery a shot helped me. By helping you to stay clean, it helped me to try and stay clean. Bysharing our shame, our fears, cleaning up our messes, I showed you some shit and you showed me some shit. So thank you. Thank you for walking through all of this shit alongside of me for the last 28 years.

"Celebrating 90 Days Clean & Sober Today..
It's so awesome, but it's so crazy. I'm seventeen years old, and I was using oxycodone, psychedelics, marijuana, and pretty much *anything* else I could get my hands on since I was 11-12 years old. After countless overdoses, arrests, charges, and all this other garbage, I finally decided to get clean ninety days ago after suffering an OD that I still wonder about because it's a miracle that I'm not dead. Being a full fledged heroin/oxycodone addict at sixteen years old is not cool, but I am so grateful to be clean today. (:

If anyone is familiar with NA, now that I have 90 days, I can sign the meeting list! If anyone ever needs support/help/just wants to talk, PM me and I'll be happy to help. (:"
"21 days off heroin and hopeful.
I thought this would be no fun. I thought people who didn't use were no fun (despite the fact that I was no longer having fun using, just ruining all my relationships and my life). It's actually dawning on me that I really never have to shoot up anymore. I never have to be dopesick again! Over the past few years of using I would say ""I used to be a musician"" because getting high prevented me from caring about writing music. Since I quit I have written 3 new songs. In fact, I'll post them soon!

EDIT:  Keep in mind that these are shitty recordings of super-duper rough drafts of these songs. I'll be fleshing them out over the holiday weekend in a much higher quality home recording with more than the basic chords and rhythm guitar. Still, you can get the gist of it, I think. Any feedback is appreciated!

I know you're better off without me. Goodbye friends, goodbye my sweet doggie, goodbye Portland. Southern Cali, looks like I'm back for good.  I will stay clean."
"I only wanted one day sober.
Sept 3 is my son's birthday. I wanted to try to not fuck up at least one of my kid's birthdays, so on Sept. 2 I spent my first day in a long time, sober. The next day I was able to bake him a cake, get him presents, and also get to a court date completely sober and not hungover.

I only wanted one day sober, but figured I might be able to make it up to two weeks, because that seemed to be about how long I could go before I was dying for a drink. Five days after I got sober, I went to my first AA meeting that wasn't court mandated (had been sentenced to two a week), and heard someone share something that snapped me awake. I never intended to stay sober for very long. If I had, the last thing I drank would definitely not have been 2 bottles of $2 Walmart wine. If I knew how AA was about to change my life, I probably would have built a shrine to Jack Daniels and did a proper goodbye. Instead, I decided to really give this AA thing a try, even though I knew it wasn't gonna work for me. Even though I couldn't stand the thought of a ""higher power"", and hated the word God. Even though my life was worse than yours, because if you had my life there's no way you could be sober either. 

I got a sponsor, attended a shitload of meetings, and worked the steps even though I was just going through the motions. I figured that if I gave it an honest shot, I could really say I'd tried everything, go back to drinking and tell everyone to leave me the fuck alone, because it didn't work. I worked the steps simply to prove them wrong. The only thing proven to be wrong....was me. 

Today is my AA bday. That one day I wanted has now turned into two years. I know that's hardly any time sober, but to go from where I was, to where I am now, is absolutely amazing. I am currently going through an extremely tough issue in my family. One of my children had a crime committed against them a couple of weeks ago, and I should be at the bottom of several bottles by now. However, thanks to the tools I've been given in this program, I am able to be present to help do the next right thing, even though it's one of the hardest things I've ever done. I don't have to fuck the situation up anymore by trying to kill my pain through a drink. I've had some awesome times in sobriety, but I think I especially appreciate being sober when life throws me some shitty curveballs. Just proves to me that this program truly does work.

Thank you to everyone here who shares their stories, asks for help, reminds me of where I've been, and shows me where I can get to. I never believed this program would work for me, but what I didn't know was....I didn't have to believe. I just had to do."

I don't know how hard I'm going to make it for myself but I'm glad that today something I did (or in this case didn't do) actually made it easier.

Well aren't we a fine looking bunch eh? All of us. Yep, you too. We're reminiscing about New Years past, or New Years last night. We're either cringing at our past behaviours, congratulating ourselves on staying strong, or hoping/wishing/planning for a sober life. 

This coming Wednesday will mark two years since I had my last drink. I hadn't planned on quitting before I did - New Years Eve two years ago was a hot mess of peach schnapps and cocaine (wtf - schnapps? lol). I just kept on drinking until I blacked out real good January 5th, and found myself utterly unable to continue. I'd lost control a LONG time before that - but January 5th 2014 was when I finally admitted it. 

I won't bore you sort the story of my recovery. This post is about NYE! My first clean and sober NYE was last year. I still had the ""gotta get out and party"" mindset, so I went out partying (sober of course) and it SUCKED. As it turns out, I have no desire to party with drunk people anymore. 

So this year, I stayed in with my new fella (he's been in recovery for 5 months) and this morning, we volunteered at a homeless shelter before coming home and having steak and eggs for breakfast - no hangovers here!

Now he's napping and I'm reminiscing about NYEs past, along with all of you. 

Happy 2016, yeah? It's our year, good things are coming out way, I can feel it!"

"The story of how my brother died today.
First please excuse any grammatical or spelling errors, I am still emotionally shaken to my very core.

I woke up this morning 9/5 and it was just like any other day. I recently moved back in with my parents, it’s been about 2 weeks now. I groggily rolled out of bed and went down stairs to grab myself something to drink. My mother was up already, bouncing around the house with more energy than I will ever be able to muster at 7 am. I asked her if she was coming into work today, to which she replied “yes as soon as I wake up your brother”. He was sleeping on the top floor of our 3 story home. I went outside for a cigarette and came back in to hear her slamming on the door to my brothers room trying to wake him up. I yelled up and asked her what was going on. She said she had been trying to wake him by slamming on the locked door for about 10 minutes. I said he is probably just still asleep, but I suppose her motherly instinct could tell there was something wrong. I brushed it off and said he is fine, he will get up soon. I went into the bathroom and a moment later I heard the most blood curdling scream I have ever heard. It almost seemed like it was coming from somewhere else. She was hysterical, repeatedly screaming “CALL 911!!” I ran halfway down the stairs and realized my cell phone was still in my pocket. I pulled it out and called 911 not knowing what to say. But somehow I just knew what was wrong, deep down in my heart, I just knew the worst had happened. I gave the operator my name and address right away and was then asked what the emergency was. I said “I think my brother is dead”, the operator needed me to confirm the situation but the door to the bedroom was still locked somehow. Apparently my mother had climbed up to the third floor bedroom through a loft from the master bedroom. I begged and pleaded with her to unlock the door but all she could was scream “Wake up! Please wake up!’ I proceeded to smash that fucking door down like it was made of matchsticks. Nothing was going to keep me out. I fell through the threshold and saw what I know will haunt me for the rest of my life. There he was, my mother cradling him rocking back and forth on the floor yelling in a mix of Korean and English. His face was swollen and blue, in his boxers and a t-shirt, there was an odor of fecal matter in the air. He looked like a poorly made mannequin of himself. I could tell right then that he was gone. But I was going to fucking resuscitate him if it was the last thing I ever do. I told the 911 operator he was blue, not breathing and unresponsive. She told me to start doing chest compression, which I did. I have never had any formal CPR training but I knew that you had to push pretty hard and possibly break the chest plate iirc. I started pounding on his chest with all my might, at which point some blood began to come out of his mouth. I mistook this for him spitting up blood so I said told her I think he is breathing! She told me to roll him on his side and clear his airways (mouth and nose) which I did. My mother was hitting him on the back beseeching him to take a breath. But nothing happened again after that. Living literally a quarter mile from a fire department the EMT’s were coming up the stairs just as this was happening. They came up and took me and my mother out of the room. I foolishly thought that maybe he was going to be okay. I prayed for the first time in my life, wishing that everything would be alright, that I could just wake up from this nightmare. It’s funny how I've been an “atheist” my entire life until I selfishly need a “god” to help me. Sadly my prayers weren't answered, which pretty much reaffirmed my lack of belief. After what seemed like an eternity the paramedics came down stairs, before he could say anything I meekly and softly said “he is gone isn’t he.” I knew that he had been dead the entire time but I just could not accept it yet, not until I had a professional tell me. The paramedic looked down and nodded his head, this is where I totally lost control of myself. I dropped onto my knees and started screaming his name, embracing my mother in my arms, uncontrollable tears, and sheer sense of terror, a loss of reality. He was gone….
My brother had just come out of rehab after kicking heroin. He was clean for about 4 and a half months. He had shot up sometime that night and overdosed. I loved him with all my heart, everything seemed to be going so well for him these past few months, however, over the past few days there were warning signs, he was getting out of work then disappearing until 1 or 2 in the morning and not wanting to say where he had been. I wish with all of my being that I had intervened when I noticed this happening. I am a recovering addict myself and I thought I knew how to appropriately deal with the warning signs of a relapse. But I failed to act, I failed to save my little brother…
 Now I am left with a myriad of emotion and no one to say anything to. I never want anyone to experience what I have today. I don’t care if this reaches everyone, but if just one person would listen to my advice then I am satisfied. Please please please don’t ignore a sign of someone who could potentially need your help. You might just save someone by pulling them aside and having a simple conversation with them. To anyone who is in recovery be strong for yourself and for the people who love you. You are worth it, more that you will ever know.

TL:DR – I found my brother overdosed this morning and I feel like it is my fault because I ignored the warning signs. If you ever see someone acting differently than they normally do, just try and talk to them about it. You might be able to save someone, maybe a simple conversation can change everything.
Edit- I am 28 and my brother was 27.

"Three years sober (and my rules for serenity).
I'll officially be three years sober tomorrow. I did it with the 12 steps as suggested in the Big Book of AA, my sponsor, my home group, and groups around the country when I travel.

I'm most grateful that my Son is fully in my life and has not seen me take a drink in three years. I'm also grateful that I have begun to live my life with vigorous honesty; to be the best me I can be. 

I'm far from perfect. My ugly defects and insecurities come to the surface often, but over time I've trained myself - among other things - to keep a running list of my rules for serenity. I don't want to come across as preachy. These particular rules apply to *ME*, and me alone. They are personal reminders and stolen sayings I've collected and keep handy whenever I get restless, irritable, and discontented. I add to it whenever a profound thought resonates with me.

I'm posting these in case they might help with someone else out there that still suffers - even if it's only one person (and PM me if you want). In no particular order...

* When you see something or someone being hurtful, cruel, ugly, vain, conceited don't react to it. Walk away from it and look for God.

* Let fear go.

* When in conflict with another, address the issue not the individual

* When you are coasting you are heading downhill, do something that requires effort.

* You have turned your life (body) and your will (thinking) over to the care of God as you understand him. So relax!

* Be here now.

* Always be teachable.

* Steps 6 and 7 are to be repeated often and whenever necessary.

* Love yourself!

... And if you have an adage that helps you in time of need, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks for reading.

"Two years today.
Two years ago I was an entry level employee for my organization, and I had embarrassed them, gotten sent home early from a work trip and was thinking I'd be fired.  I went to AA, worked the program and now--two years later--I'm one of the directors of the organization, and I'm addressing a major civic group on our behalf tonight.  They have me running two offices at once right now!  The Steps got me sober, helped me stay that way and most importantly kept me sane and useful as I surrendered the one tool that had solved my problems before--drugs and alcohol.

For those still struggling, or in early sobriety I gotta say that getting a sponsor, doing the steps in order, going to a meeting every day and getting involved in helping others has made all the difference.  If you do nothing else, get a sponsor and do whatever s/he says.

Thank you for all your encouragement and wisdom!  For the last 731 days I have had to do something every day to keep sober, and some days it was just leaving a few comments on r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY.  Great community here, and good luck on all your journeys!  "

"3 years clean today. Here's a quick story about my Dad.
I shared this in an Ask Reddit thread and thought this story was as good as any to celebrate getting here. Please share anything you can relate to.

When I was 17 I got thrown out of my house because I kept drinking and using drugs. A couple years later I was allowed to move back in and after a while the same result. (This may have happened another time or two, my memory is a little fuzzy).
My oldest brother also lived there through most of his 20s, and being the self centered, finger pointing ingrate that I was I couldn't understand why he could stay and I kept getting kicked out. Probably had something to do with the fact that he wasn't a drug addict and could be trusted, but I didn't see it that way. To me, they were playing favorites and it wasn't ""fair"" to me.
My Dad and I met for dinner one night, and I asked him why. Why can he stay, why can you just throw me away? Now my Dad was the best kind of man you'd ever want to be your father, so I don't know why I expected him to throw a laundry list of my faults as a person in my face as justification for kicking me out. That's not the man he was, but I expected it none the less.
""Because I know that, no matter what, you'll be OK. You can take care of yourself.""
I was still in my active addiction when he died too young, but those words helped me when I began my recovery journey. The best part is that, as seemingly always, he was right. It took another 10 years or so, and he didn't live to see it, but today I have 3 years clean from drugs & alcohol. I've still got issues to deal with, but I can honestly say that today, no matter what, I'm OK."
"I'm a 24 year old female, clean from heroin since June 4th of 2010, and I really fucking need a friend.
I've been hopeless submitting my frustrations to a few subreddits this evening reaching for any kind of support or conversation. Someone mentioned this subreddit.. here's hoping I'll get my internet therapy buddy.

I'm terribly exhausted and depressed, but basically I've been addicted to opiates since 13 when I got a back injury. After 10 years, and stepping up to IV drug use, I finally went to a neurosurgeon and have an appointment tomorrow to schedule surgery...

Because of becoming a drug addict so young I've been through a lot.. I was brutally anally raped and I can only type that, I've never been able to make those words audible. I've been a prostitute and a drug dealer, I'm a survivor of some of the most extreme forms of domestic violence.

I feel so very alone and so very sad today.. I can't imagine many things that make life worthwhile at the moment..

If someone put a bag in front of me, I can confidently say that it'd be all over right then and there.

UPDATE: I am here... I became too lethargic and withdrawn to continue with this. I'm reading the comments now. Thank you all very much for your concern and experience."
"I just added another 24 hours... and that makes five years of continuous sobriety for this ""newcomer""
Congratulations to everyone who just added another day to their continuous sobriety!

Today, I'm celebrating five years clean and sober. It has been a bit longer than that since my last drink, but I don't think that is exactly the same as being sober. Also, I began today like I start every day: by re-committing myself to another 24 hours of sobriety.

Parts of the past few weeks have been intense, as my best friend is being treated for cancer. He's handling it with incredible grace and continuing to think more about others than about himself. (His 28 years of sobriety certainly helped him learn to do that.)

I'll go to one of my favorite meetings tonight and pick up a five year chip. I don't really like getting them, because it's like having a spotlight shining on me that I don't really want. But it helps people to see that AA is either the answer or at least can be a major part of the answer if they're alcoholic like me, and that it can work for them too if they put in the needed effort.

I also feel like a ""newcomer"" in AA, and I hope that never changes. Part of what works for me is remembering that sobriety is like walking down an elevated railroad track; if I keep centered and try to remain mindful about what I'm doing, I'll be fine. If I stray too far, there is a steep drop-off on either side.

And there are many more people with longer periods of sobriety than what I have. I saw a guy pick up a 33-year chip a couple of weeks ago. He was asked how he did that, and he replied, ""One day at a time.""

And a guy who I had never met before picked up an 8-month chip yesterday and he said that's how he is staying sober too."

"10 years clean this weekend. My story.
Got inspired to write this after commenting in another thread. 

At 17 years old, I went to college. I immediately began drinking heavily and soon began experimenting with drugs. I barely made it a semester (Although, if you fail that semester, does it count?) and dropped out. I continued partying and taking drugs and doing an amazing amount of stupid shit along the way.

The worst period of my life (although I didn't see it that way at the time) was when I encountered my friends father one day when I went to pick up a supply from my dealer. I had known my friend for about 10 years at that point and I had known for a while that her father was a dealer, although I was still surprised to see him there. 

Anyway, we talked for a little bit and he told me that he'd give me a discount if I bought from him, since I was his daughters friend, and in exchange for doing him the occasional favor. 

Turned out that the ""occasional"" favor was to ""entertain"" him and his friends on weekends. We'd have benders on the weekends, where I fucked and sucked him and his friends in exchange for drugs. 

This went on for a while until he decided that I could be more profitable to him if he extended my ""favors"" to people outside of his inner circle, so that he could get better deals from his suppliers, and at bigger parties as entertainment. 

I started out as a plaything for him and his friends and eventually he began pimping me out to others and this went on for around 4 and a half years. 
His daughter had been away for school the entire time and I had avoided her every time that she went home during school breaks. 

It was her that eventually got me to get help. One day, after years of no contact between the two of us, she found my address at the time and showed up at my front door... I was living in a really bad area and sharing an apartment with a few other people, all of which were also addicts. She'd had no idea how bad things had gotten and broke down just inside of my door and convinced me to go to rehab not long after that. 

Partway through my stay, she came to visit, and I came clean about everything.... She sat there, crying, as she listened to me and when I finished, she got up and walked out. I've tried to reach out to her since then but she has never replied. 

From what I heard, she confronted her father soon after our conversation and broke off contact with him. She transferred schools farther away soon after that, moved, and hasn't had anything to do with either of us since then. I don't blame her, not in the least. If I were her, I'd have probably done the same thing. 

I just hope that she's doing well and that she knows how thankful I am that she saved my life."
"Celebrating an anniversary today...
I woke up another day clean today. When I got a voicemail from a friend in NA, I remembered that today was my anniversary. I opened my clean time calculator to verify I had 21 years and my math was apparently wrong...

I actually have **22 years** clean today. Yay me!"
"Pothead in recovery
So I just shared this on someone else's post, but I need to write this here myself. I don't know why I'm up in my head about this right now. My sponsor says I need a chip on my shoulder or something, but I still struggle with this no matter how much step work I do.

My DOC was weed. That's it. No coke, crack, heroin, pills, not even alcohol (although I would drink if I had nothing else available). I've never broken a law worse than driving under the influence. I've never been arrested. I've never sold drugs. I've never been homeless, or broke, or any of that.

As a kid, all the way through High School, I was as straight laced as they come. I was also truly socially awkward, and was bullied like crazy. I hated my life, and wanted to be ""popular"", so I turned to alcohol and weed in college. I quickly found that weed was all I really wanted, and ditched the alcohol after a while.

At first, weed let me feel cool at parties. But for the overwhelming majority of my active addiction, I just sat at home, alone, not having any human contact, getting high. I was lonely and miserable. The few people in my life, like my parents, I pushed away to protect my getting high (they staged an intervention for me at one point). Lies and manipulation of the people around me was my way of life.

I worked throughout most of my addition, it was how I justified everything. On my 26th birthday some big shit went down, and I had a total emotional breakdown and threw away my career. I spent the next 8 months with nothing, feeling like a failure, trapped in a bubble of misery I didn't think I could get out of.

Then I went to NA. I cried, I begged for help, I didn't feel like I belonged, and everyone there loved me and picked me up and helped me to recovery. Today I have been clean 2 years, 3 months, and 24 days. I'm so blessed for that.

Yet sometimes I still feel the need to play this tape through, I still sometimes struggle with feeling like the only person in the room with a story like mine. There's no Marijuana Anonymous where I live, unfortunately. I love NA, but in early recovery I lived in an area with MA, and those meetings helped keep these thoughts at bay. 

I hate /r/leaves, everyone there seems so casual about quitting. ""Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna stop now."" Well good fucking for you, some of us didn't have that luxury.

Anyway, I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I know I belong here, and I'm never giving up my seat."
"It's 1:57 a.m, i just woke up out of a dead sleep and poured my entire stash of h. into the toilet
I can honestly not give one rhyme or reason as to what made me do it. It was like i was sleep walking, before i even knew what i was doing i was already out of my door standing in front the toilet. 

So i thought, fuck it! Might as well [dump it!](http://imgur.com/a/9iMWY)"
"Does anyone else here just hate the way alcohol is accepted and promoted in society?
Might be a little bit of a rant here but here goes.

Been in recovery for a few months, just had a three day binge on alcohol, eff it minor setback. But I've done pretty much every other drug on the market, getting addicted to quite a few in the process and none of them have been as hard to kick. Which in my opinion is due to the social conditions that not only make drinking an accepted habit, but actually promotes it. Alcohol is as hard a drug as heroin, crack and meth in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned it's actually worse than crack. No parent in their right mind would ever dream of giving a young child a toot of crack, a dig of heroin or a line of meth. So why the fuck is it almost commonplace that you get a glass of wine with your dinner in some places? I first got drunk at 8, me and some friends stole a crate of beer from my house and got wasted. Now to us it never really seemed to be such a bad thing, my parents were drug addicts and dealers but I knew that wasn't normal. 


Everyone's parents seemed to drink alcohol though, never really thought by doing it over and over from a young age I'd end up with a worse addiction than the drug addicts that came begging at my house every night, that I'd end up completely screwed up blacking out randomly and waking up in the police cells again from being 13 plus on a regular basis. Now we had DARE at school, had all the drugs are bad m'kay bullshit and learned about how weed will kill you (lol) but they never really made such a big thing about alcohol. 

I'm struggling like hell to get through social events these days because everyone I know seems to meet up at the pub and get wasted whenever it's time for a reunion. But that's ok because it's taxed by our government. Yet where I live people beat the shit out of heroin addicts randomly when they see them because they are ''dirty scumbags'', even though the end result of addiction to either of them is just the same thing, a lot of the people who act like this are worse addicts than the heroin users. None of the people doing smack, crack or other hard drugs that I know would ever even think of using in front of their kids (Barring a few idiots) but every weekend you see masses of parents with their kids in the pub getting wrecked in front of them. What I'm trying to say is... WHY THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN ACCEPTED BY SOCIETY AS A WHOLE??? 

Rant over."
"NA meetings update
So I don't know if y'all remember me or not but about a year and a half ago I reached out and asked this sub for some information on starting up a narcotics anonymous meeting in our area. It took us awhile to get it off the ground but it's been having steady attendance, and since we've had such success not only are we opening up another meeting in the next town over, but we have managed to coordinate an H&I meeting in the county jail, this will be the first time NA has ever had a meeting inside this particular facility.

"My boyfriend died today.
I've never posted here before so if I do something wrong I'm sorry in advance. So,  I'll start by saying that I am a grateful, recovering alcoholic. I went to rehab December 5st, 2015. There, I met the most wonderful person I have ever come across in my 25 years of life. Cute, funny, intelligent, interesting, open and honest, a good listener and we had loads of stuff in common but just enough so that we still had other interests that we couldn't wait to show each other. He and I were inseparable, we were head over heels and everyone knew it. He got out of treatment exactly 3 weeks before I did and by the time he had left, we had decided to find a place of our own in San Francisco. While he was waiting for me to get out, he found us an apartment. Our own little place to start our new life together. It's perfect. The size,  the view,  the building. All perfect. We moved in on February 3rd. We've since fully furnished our place and adore everything about it. Nothing in the world feels better than holding someone close in a place you've both put together to call home. A place to feel safe and speak freely. A safe place for us with nothing to trigger us, no drugs or alcohol available. Just each other. Until today. My boyfriend overdosed and died. He'll never be there to comfort me when I'm feeling like I'm going to break. Yesterday, he told me that I am his soul mate and that I'd make a beautiful bride. Today, my whole world ended. 


Edit- thank you all so much.  For your condolences and empowering words.  I still feel like I'm drowning but the support I've been shown has heat me afloat. "
"I just celebrated 6 months sober
How exciting, I just celebrated 6 months sober. My drug of choice was heroin so in the past I would try to get better by substituting other drugs. I now realize that that just DOES NOT work. The addiction always surfaces again. Tried suboxone, and that is some bad bad shit. This time I just...stopped everything and it really is amazing how much better things are now. I'm currently working on the 4th step which is a grind but I can see it will be very worth the effort. Peace & love to all my people"

"9 Years Today
Hi, recovered alcoholic and meth addict here, just wanted to say hi and let anyone who wants to know that this recovery stuff works.

When I finally realised through 20 years of bitter struggle and multiple attempts to control my drinking that I could not control OR stop altogether I just wanted to know one thing: 


Can I have a cool life sober?

The answer is yes.


Through a good 12 step sponsor, working the steps in the book 'Alcoholics Anonymous', helping others to work the steps,
consistent meditation and prayer and doing service ie: carrying the message at meetings, prisons and detox facilities, I found happiness fir the first time in my life.

Sobriety is real cool for me. 

It has given me more power and peace than I have ever known, as long as I stay in the trenches I believe I will stay sober AND happy.

Thanks for being here, its through people like yourselves that I have recovered, and to *stay recovered*, I just gotta keep giving it away ;)

"I made it a year!
A year ago today I was scared out of my mind not knowing what was ahead of me on the journey to getting sober. Well it sure as heck was not an easy thing to do but I did it with the support of those who love me and for that I am eternally thankful. It really is amazing to try to imagine yourself at your absolute worst and the difference a year can make. While by no means am I 100% cured of addiction nor will I ever be I have accepted the fact this is something that I will have to live with for the rest of my life and you know I'm okay with that it's not shameful to say I've made mistakes because now I can take these experiences and help others. Thank you for reading :)"
"Today I am two weeks sober and I just went to my first AA meeting last night.
I wish that I was able to admit to myself long ago that I had a problem with alcohol.  It was not an easy thing to admit.  I always thought that I was the exception.  As it turns out, everyone thinks that way who is an alcoholic.  I thought that I could control my drinking if I really wanted to; that I had a right to drink.  I am an adult and I can do as I please.  I thought it wasn’t hurting anyone but me.  All lies.

Well I have finally taken the first step, given in and admitted that I have a problem with alcohol.  It’s been two weeks since I have had a drink and I went to an AA meeting last night.

Here is a little background on that.  I had gone to a few meetings in the past, but I didn’t go with an open mind.  When I went, I hadn’t truly admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic.  I went for the wrong reasons. I felt that I didn’t belong and that the people there were not like me.

Yesterday I went in to the AA meeting knowing I had a problem, knowing why I was there and I was willing to give AA a chance.  I couldn’t be more pleased with the results.  It turned out that the group was a great fit for me.  The people there had the same problem as me; they were no different from me.

I knew if I went in and even if it didn’t work that I could find another group and eventually find a place to fit.  I am going to a few other meetings this week.  I had been against AA in the past, but that was a huge part of my problem.  It took humbling myself and sacrificing my misconceptions and misbeliefs and opening my heart and mind to what it could be.

I am an atheist and I don’t know what my higher power can be or will be, but I do know that saying I don’t want to go because its “spiritual” was a bunch of BS.  I had to let myself have an open mind.  I don’t have to believe in God or religion.  I just have to go, find a sponsor and do the steps.  I have nothing to lose by doing this.  I have EVERYTHING to lose by drinking…. Including my life.

Thanks for reading my post.

"I'm totally fucking heartbroken. Now I get why they say don't sleep with anyone in early recovery.
Luckily, I didn't sleep with him.  I ran into this guy I went to high school with at a meeting and was really attracted to him.  The feeling was mutual.  We are both early in recovery so agreed to take things slow.  We weren't hanging out a lot, but hanging out after meetings.  We made out once.  

On Thursday he tried to get me to sleep with him and I almost did it.  I told him I really wanted to but thought it was worth waiting for.  I wanted to be sure it wasn't just about sex for him.

Apparently it was, because tonight we all went out after a CA meeting and he was hitting on chicks left and right, culminating in a huge flirtatious conversation and getting a girl's number 2 feet from where I was sitting.  

I'm so glad I didn't sleep with him because to be honest, this shit makes me want to use.  I'm not going to, but still.  This whole thing has been awful for my sobriety.  I learned my lesson and won't make this mistake again.

"3 years sober today.  The promises are real.
I have 3 years of sobriety today.  The promises are real.  

About 9 years ago, in the spring of 2002, I realized I had a drinking problem.  It had progressed from weekend social drinking, to weekend benders, to light drinking during the week to heavy drinking every night.  I usually blacked out, and would wake up with no sense of what time or day it was, or where I had been or how I had gotten home.  I got into arguments / fights with friends, was kicked out of school, and destroyed my career.

My family and friends packed me off to a fancy 28 day rehab in the mountains.  I fought and argued with the program, thinking I could do it myself if only these stupid people would leave me alone.  I stayed sober for 3 days after leaving.

I gave up on trying to salvage my friends and career and let myself drink full time.  I burned through $8000 in savings in about 4 months of constant intoxication.   When I was completely broke and despondent, I entered another rehab, this time for 2 months.  After leaving I moved to another state.  I stayed sober another 5 weeks.  

My friends moved on with their lives and my family mostly wrote me off.  I worked odd jobs and pawned most of my possessions to support my drinking.  I was arrested several times , spent a few weekends in jail, got into fights in bars and on the street, was evicted from my apartment, and was taken to detox more times than I can remember.  I tried to kill myself and was found by a neighbor in a pool of my own blood.  I spent a month in a psychiatric hospital, and was loaded to the gills with various medications.

I spent about 3 years as a ‘transient’.  Not quite homeless, but moving from one cheap motel to another, staying with other people.  Everything I owned fit into a duffel bag and small backpack.  I worked day labor, picked up random construction jobs, etc.  Typically I would work when I could find work, for as long as I could put off the compulsion to drink.  Never more than 5 days in a row, but I would occasionally be able to sober up enough to show up to work on Monday for several weeks in a row.  More often I would work for 3 or 4 days, buy a few packs of cigarettes and a jug of cheap vodka, and spend the next two days in a semi-comatose state in a small, squalid apartment.  I only went outside to buy more booze.
After a good 4 or 5 day bender I would be out of money.  Usually I would not be in any condition to work or even leave the apartment.  That was when I would have to go through withdrawal.  I would get the shakes to where I couldn’t trust myself not to collapse on the sidewalk.  I would run fevers and sweat profusely, and then suddenly my inner thermostat would change and I would be shivering in my now wet clothes and sheets.  I don’t know how many times I pissed my own bed because generally I would pass out for so long and so hard it would dry before I woke up.  I would be ravenously hungry, but my body couldn’t handle more than a bite or two of solid food.  I would drink juice, or stir some sugar into tap water to keep me going until my digestive system straightened out.  The first 12 hours of withdrawal I would vomit so often I kept a jug of water on the nightstand and a towel folded on the floor next to the bed.  That way I wouldn’t have to get up and crouch over the sink or toilet.  It was mostly water anyways, mixed with stomach acid.  This helped absolutely destroy my teeth.  After a day of this, I usually felt well enough to rinse the stink off me, put on some marginally clean clothes, and find something to eat.  If I could scrape together a dollar or two I could buy some noodles or something from the convenience store.  If I got steady early enough (by noon) I would go to the soup kitchen.

That was my life.

On July 8 2008 I was coming down from another bender.  I was trying to stave off withdrawal by nursing what little vodka I had left.  I had maybe 3 dollars to my name.  I remember it wasn’t enough to get drunk off of or to buy any cigarettes.  The landlord had told me that I was behind on the rent and he wasn’t going to put up with my shit anymore.  I knew the DTs were only a few hours away, and that this hellish process was going to repeat itself again.

I opened the phone book and began calling different clinics and social workers.  Finally I found a hospital (not a rehab) that was willing to take me on the state Medicaid type insurance I had.  I checked in late that evening, and woke up sober on July 9th, 2008.

Today my life is very different.  I wake up full of energy and go to a job I enjoy.  I have a supervisory position with a fair amount of responsibility and influence.  I’m not a CEO but I’m well paid and happy.  

I’m 6 ft tall and went from 170lbs at admission to 195lbs now.  It’s mostly muscle.  I got my teeth fixed.  I look great if I may say so myself.

Most importantly I have a beautiful girlfriend who loves me.  I have friends – not drinking buddies – friends.  My family returns my calls, they invite me for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  I have a car for the first time in 8 years, I have savings.  I travel, I go out and do fun things.  I’m HAPPY.  

**TLDR**
The Promises are real.  No matter how low you are, how fucked up you think your life is or how hopeless you feel, you can get sober.  You can overcome addiction and reclaim your life.  And it’s worth it.  You’re worth it.

"5 Years
5 years ago today, I was making plans for one last party. I'd been strung out on benzos and opiates for a solid year. My health was shot, basically not taking care of a few minor illnesses in order to keep milking prescriptions. I was tired and I was done, so I had gathered a ton of drugs, coke, e, hash oil, xanax, ativan, oxy... going to have one last bash with a few close 'friends'.

I took a nap, and when I got up, my living room was full of people. My first thought, honest to god, was 'I don't have enough e for all these people'. My second thought was, 'of course, my intervention'. I started laughing. I laughed and laughed until I had to sit down. No one knew what I was laughing at. My sister thought it was the irony of me, the ultimate party guy, finally reaching that point. My wife thought I was being an asshole. I was laughing because I was relieved. I told them, 'Let's go, you don't have to read any letters, let's go'. They worked hard on those letters though, and wanted a chance to vent. I don't remember them, not then. I kept them, and read them after my first birthday. 

The first three days of detox were a nightmare. Even with the benefits of modern pharmacology, I was a mess, paranoid, talking to myself, muttering threatening things under my breath. I tried to disable the security cameras. I tried to get my best friend to kidnap my son, so I could leave and meet him somewhere, flee the country before my wife could finish arranging to keep him from me forever, which is what I was sure was her plan, her reason for having me locked up in a rehab, with no wallet and no transportation.

On day three, I was empty. I was done. I surrendered. I got on my knees and I asked a universe that I was certain was empty, for help. If there's anything out there, please, I don't want to live this way anymore. Up until this point, as long as I could remember, going back 35 years, there had been a hole inside me. A gaping black place that I could always feel. I had tried to fill it with a million things, going back to childhood. My grandmothers christianity, occult dabblings, games, then drugs and women. Nothing ever filled it. Three days without drugs, the longest I had gone in more than 15 years, and that hole was so vivid and painful it was the realest thing in the universe. 

I asked any gods that were listening, for any help they could give.

And in that moment, I felt something. A tiny grain of something, hope? Faith? I believed for a second that I could get better, that I was not going to die this way, and that tiny speck of hope felt like a mountain, in a place so empty.

I haven't had the desire to use drugs or alcohol since. I joined a 12 step recovery program, I got a sponsor and I did everything they asked me to do. My life today is better than I could ever have imagined. 

Everyone out there who's my brother or sister in fellowship, thank you."

"One year today...
It's official.

I hit my one year sobriety mark just half an hour ago.
Looking back on the past year and I have to admit that there have been a lot of positive changes that I don't believe are coincedental to being sober.

Better grades in school, more focus, enjoying life more, less depression. It's been a tough ride, but totally worth the trip.

Now I just need to make sure I don't let it all go to waste with an ""Eve"" in the garden (women/relationships/love has always been my Achilles' heal)

Anyway, just wanted to chime in and say that if I can do it, anyone can.

Stay strong!"
"7 days clean from speed
Today I am 7 days clean from amphetamines. I have also been taking wellbutrin for 7 days, as I've done well on it in the past and it is often prescribed off-label for recovering stim addicts. It seems to be helping with my energy levels, although it's definitely making me a lot more bitchy. 

I feel okay today. I've been taking everything slow and have reduced my expectations for myself with regards to being productive. I just feel so slow and stupid. When I was using, I could crush out homework so quickly with no problem.

My biggest fear is that I'm always going to be slow and stupid without the drugs. I justed started studying my masters in a STEM field after graduating from undergrad with distinction. I'm terrified that the good grades and scholarships and awards were only possible because I was using amphetamines. I'm scared that it was only the drugs making me smart.

I kicked benzo dependence several months ago, but I was never truly addicted to the benzos. I was dependent, but I never took them to get high or hide from my problems, only because I wanted to sleep after too much speed. Amphetamines are a whole different league because I actually love the high and, more importantly, what I am able to accomplish academically and productivity-wise when I'm using. 

I'm really just banking on my energy levels and cognitive ability improving with time. Also, my desire for closer and more genuine relationships is a big motivator for me getting clean.

However, I admit I am proud for making it this far. I haven't been clean for this long in many months.

Edit: I just want to add that I would love to hear stories from other recovering speed addicts and gain insight into what I can expect as far as concentration and cognitive ability recovering after getting clean. I have lurked for a long time but I've never posted until now. Would love some support or insight. Thanks. "
"In 8 hours I’ll be 21 weeks sober from opiates.
Hello fellow Redditors in Recovery, 

First time posting here. Hope you’re all staying strong and well, and for those suffering, hang in there and trust the process. Everyone is different and I don’t wish to drop anymore mindless motivational platitudes... just if you really focus on fixing one domain of your life at a time, things will improve, and they’ll start to improve exponentially quicker than you think. 

I don’t have too much to say, just that I’m on the brink of 21 weeks and I’m feeling back to normal. That is to say, my body has reached homeostasis, I’m sleeping well, and I’m not assailed by wild and volatile mood swings. Just the normal kind, good and bad days, all that. Summer is here and is the time of my greatest happiness and comfort, and I am grateful for every day that I’m not enslaved to 30mg Oxy pills.

One of the greatest things that’s helped me get through these past few months has been to engage myself in learning something. I play music as a hobbyist, and while I’m comfortable saying I’m pretty good, there’s always something I can improve upon, and to get lost for hours and to start seeing positive results from your efforts yields a very enduring sense of satisfaction. Time slows down, and also speeds up. It’s weird. But as long as I’m learning something, music, some philosophy, math, whatever it may be, I never regret the time spent. It makes me feel renewed I guess, like I’m in a process of Becoming something new. 

With great affection,

Sevil Drib"
"I’ve stopped lying to myself
I never thought it would be me, but it is. I am an addict. My use may not seem like addiction to some, but to me it is. I am an addict. I’ve wasted so much time.  I was lying to myself about what amphs do, I thought they helped me do what I needed to do. I thought they gave me experiences with others that I couldn’t have otherwise. In reality, they are just taking from me.

Amphs are taking my time. Most of it.

Amphs are taking my mental health.

Amphs are taking my sexuality.

Amphs are taking my muscles, my back, my legs, my neck and my eyes.

Amphs are taking my money.

Amphs are taking my friendships.

Amphs are taking my girlfriend.

Amphs are taking my family.

Amphs are taking my education.

Amphs are giving me nothing.

It’s been a day since I stopped lying to myself.  I’ve won today. I will win tomorrow."
"meth and sex addict in recovery for ~2years, sober for ~1 year (x-post /r/addiction)
tldr; meth and sex addict doing the thing and living free and happy now, get with me

new to reddit, wanting to reach out to a wider community. i don't meet a lot of people successfully recovering from meth addiction, and i meet very few people recovering from meth addiction AND sex addiction like myself. I'm sure there are people out there doing it, because I'm doing it, so lets get together c:

I've been sober for over a year now. I'm gay, and when i found meth in the bathhouse it was perfect for what i wanted - crazy, destructive sex on crazy, destructive drugs with friendly welcoming people (just kidding they were all crazy and destructive, like me). i was 19.. that was seven years ago. i was diagnosed with hiv four years ago, tried to kill myself later that year.. i really didn't expect to live to see another year, let alone four. life is totally different for me today, its absolutely surreal. i have friends (i had none), a job that pays rent and bills (and is legal), I'm going to school and have so much joy in my life.

one reason I want to reach out is that recovering for meth can be extremely demoralizing. i think its something chemical about that drug, but i felt like i had lingering effects for 6months or more. i felt like i would never stop having cravings... i would get the taste of shooting up and it would last for ten, twenty, sometimes thirty minutes. it just.. gets better over time. and the literature on people with a fusion of meth and sex does not have very optimistic statistics on the possibility of recovering... but stastics don't apply to the individual, and I'm living proof of that. 

i want to reach out to those of y'all suffering out there, give whatever support and hope i can because it can be done. early recovery might be total hell, but there is a life of joy, freedom and ease on the other side of that hell. we just have to stick together and take it one day at a time. "
"If you've suffered childhood trauma, you're 4600% more likely to become an injecting drug user than if you haven't. We then go on to treat addicts in a way that seems designed to keep them hooked - Yohann Hari
“When we look at addicts, if we are honest – and I feel it too, even though I have loved many addicts in my life – it’s hard to keep out voices of moral judgement. We look at somebody who is chronically using alcohol or drugs, and we say with a shake of the head: “Well, I wouldn’t do that.” By the end of my journey, I had realized that makes as much sense as looking at somebody who has had their legs amputated after a car crash and saying: “Cutting off your legs is weird. I would never do that.” Addicts have been in car crashes of the soul.”

"A lesson I learned early in recovery.
I was about 6 months sober and the AA international convention was coming to a city near me. I was asked to volunteer and accepted because my sponsor told me to always accept commitments. My mind was always playing tricks on me though, so I was scared to buy a ticket to the convention because I was uncertain I could stay sober long enough to make it through 6 more months. I told a friend and he asked me the following question, ""did you stay sober today?"" I replied, ""yeah,"" and he said, ""well what did you do to stay sober today?"" I replied, ""I prayed, went to a meeting, called my sponsor, worked on steps, and tried to help others."" He responded, ""well do that shit tomorrow and you should be fine then, too."" Since that moment nearly 4 years ago, I've never worried about my ability to stay sober long term. Work on your sobriety one day at a time and ""one day at a time"" easily turns  into ""one day at a time in a row.""  "
"Alcohol is a drug.
I’m glad weed and pills were my drug of choice bc I would have never got sober in AA if it was alcohol I would still be in denial and I probably would have kept using alcohol never finding this better easier life.  Alcohol is only useful when your using it.  Then it’s a depressant only depending on you using more for the effect.  I learned I can raise my bottom in AA.  I learned I can have an easier life without the pills and weed.  All I had to do was come to terms that I’m an addict no matter the drug and celebrate life with others who suffer.  It’s awesome."

Got with a new therapist today and he is really fantastic.

""  I could die tomorrow, so why not get clean and sober and enjoy life instead of wasting my time on drugs.  Why not live my life and have a good time, instead of risking my life on drugs. 

And idk, that just really hit me hard. After words, he pulled out one of those cups you pee in and he was like, if you're comfortable i would like to test you and make sure you're still on track and i passed!

Hi I'm new to this. My sister told me this could help me out. Just reading a few posts I realized that it can. So I decited to tell a little story.

I lost respect from people I love. 99 percent of my family doesn't know about my addictions untill now. I told my sister and that's something I thought I would never be able to do.

She accepted me for who I am now we are in a process of getting me back out into the world

"You can't ""Save"" anyone
Today I had to confront my Roomate about using in the house. I've had my suspicions but last night it all clicked. 

My best friend asked me who I brought to the meeting and I said my roommate, he responded with, he's clean? I said yeah he's got over a year.....

 Then I started backtracking on his behaviors the past week or two.

Today very long, stressful, emotional day all around. From having to confront him, to finding his needle, to trying to find him treatment for hours, to knowing he didn't have a place to go, to hoping he was going to be  alright. All I could do was be there for support, hug him and wish him well. Luckily he was scholarshiped into a detox 

It's extremely tough to not try and ""save"" someone, especially one you care for. This is a program of ATTRACTION , not promotion. The best thing I could do was take a step back, and let him hit his bottom, and become willing.

But I am grateful this happened, not only could this have saved his life, but i was reminded just how shitty life is in active addiction. 

This too shall pass"
"7 years sober, and I'm sick and tired of AA
Anyone else get like this? I've been through the 12 steps and have sponsored a few people, but something is definitely wrong with my life right now and AA/the program just doesn't seem to give me any juice anymore. I'm actually hating going to meetings and if I reach to my friends and sponsor, I just get the same old cliche fucking responses that are driving me up the wall. I honestly think I'm depressed and need some outside therapy - I recognize that AA is a way of getting me away from drinking and is not a cure-all. Is it terrible if i just take a break from it and focus my life on recovery from depression? Fuck.

EDIT: thanks for all the help everyone, I'm going to seek out a therapist for sure. furthermore I'm going to start getting a few other things in my life that are lacking...like a new creative endeavor, some traveling, and some other spiritual practices that I've been watching help others (there's a few meditation/buddhist groups in my area, and I know some AA peoples that get a lot out of attending that stuff). But yeah, some therapy is needed for sure."

"How waffles help me understand ""god""
When I first started recovery I realized that I could not understand god, and I did not need to. Here is how I understand today.

Assume for a minute that something created me, cares for me, loves me, and has a plan for me. These are the characteristics of a higher power implicit in the 12 Steps, right? ""power greater than myself"", ""care of god"", ""god's will for us"", that sort of thing, right?

While I was using I thought I was the center of the universe, so the next bit of this thought experiment came pretty easy. What would it be like to **be** a Higher Power? I know, I can make waffles. I love waffles. I have a plan for waffles. Heck, they can help me carry out my plan, right? OK, so I am my waffle's higher power.

Do waffles understand me? Nope. Do they need to? Nope. They just have to be waffles. 

And from my perspective it is a good deal. I get yummy waffles that fuel me all morning, giving me the power to do good, or whatever. 

From the waffle's point of view though, it kind of sucks. To the waffle this ""higher power"" is going to chew him up and use him and in the end he is just poop. 

So, do I, as god's waffle, focus on the fact that I am dying a little bit every day, that life is hard and painful, and just not fair? Or do I rejoice in the fact that I get to be covered in sweetness for a short time until I can help fuel the love of the cosmos in some small way?

Today I will try to be of service to my fellow waffles."

"Just hit 21 days clean
I woke up 21 days ago and decided I had enough.  I have smoked pot since I was 16, regularly for the last 10 years since I was 18, and drank daily in varying quantities for the last 8 years.  I was drinking 750ml of bourbon or rye every 4 days in addition to beer and wine for the last two years.  I had the shakes at night for the first week and they have gone for the most part, but I have been having a terrible time getting good sleep.  I am not bothered in the daytime by symptoms but all night seems to suck for several nights a week.  I have the stoned feeling in my limbs, tingly and twitchy, hoping that goes away soon.  Even with that, I have had no desire to go back to booze or weed, so I feel very happy with where I am at right now, and I have dropped 10 pounds in the first three weeks without the booze and the snacking.

"5 and a half years sober and I'm miserable
I was one of those guys who was head over heels in love with the program. I went from a heroin junkie who had been in and out of jail and prison for 10 years, to a homeowner and addiction counselor, and my life just seemed amazing. I became a person I really liked and got married and had a little girl.  A couple years ago my marriage fell apart due to my mother-in-law committing suicide. My ex just lost it. Sadly, after 8 months of trying to fix the marriage, I was through with being lied to and cheated on. We got divorced and my ex relapsed.  She ended up abusing and neglecting my daughter several times pretty severely. Luckily I documented everything and was able to get full custody of our daughter.  My ex lives in another state now and has a new baby with her new boyfriend, and they both actively drink and use. Thankfully, my little girl is doing extremely well after several months of therapy - almost like nothing happened.  She is very smart and I get amazing reports from her teachers.  I am back in school full-time trying to get my Master's so I can provide the life I want for us.
After I became a single parent, my life changed drastically. Friendships fizzled out and eventually died, my social life is non-existent (obviously), and my meeting attendance and program involvement has stopped totally. I still keep in touch with people I care about from meetings but it's fairly superficial.  Every night she goes to bed around 7:30 and I clean the house and make her lunch for the next day and eat my dinner. And then the loneliness sets in. There's a woman I've been seeing for about a month who I care about immensely, and our relationship is great, but the times when I'm alone are so hard.  I find myself choking up and wanting to cry for no reason, or breaking down in tears at vaguely sad Facebook videos.  I feel very alone. I used to feel like I had dozens of people I could talk to, but now I feel like there's no one.  My group of close friends has been steadily drifting apart since one of our group relapsed and killed himself last year, and we don't talk much anymore. I don't feel like I can speak to my family about my feelings because I don't want them to worry about me relapsing. I have a lot on my shoulders and I just feel so isolated. I have told the woman I'm dating about a lot of this, but I don't want to constantly just emotionally dump on her because I have no one else.  It's a shitty feeling. After the extremely messy divorce, there was an adjustment period where I had to figure out how to do life as a single parent of a young child. It's possible that I just became very action-oriented at that point to avoid processing the pain of what had happened. And maybe now that things are smoother, the feelings are coming out. I don't know. I just know that I'm tired of feeling so sad all the time. "
"One year!
A year ago today I got home from a drug fueled festival and realized that throwing a month of sobriety away had totally not been worth it. Then a few days later when I had a crisis around almost using but overcame the urges, I realized that counting time was something that actually mattered to me. This date marks a year of doing the next right thing, and all of the magic that's come from that. It's still hard to believe that I'm happier without drugs, but looking back the evidence speaks for itself.

Last week I spent some time with my family, and got an update on my uncle. He's someone from whom alcohol has taken a lot. Lost his career in law, multiple DUIs, lots of time spent in jail, and finally a wife who had stuck with him for years before he burnt the bridge forever. Didn't have any relationship with his two kids for years. Anyway, he's finally gotten his shit together and started to turn things around. Speaking to his kids again, taking care of his body, and stringing together time. I asked my parents how long it had been and I was blown away to hear them reveal that it had been over \*5 years\* since he's drank. What the fuck!? It feels like this dudes time feels like it's been a blip on the radar to me because he hasn't been actively involved in my life, and yet it turns out he's got as much time as my biggest role model in recovery. I think that revelation was my own journey's way of reminding me to stay humble.

As some of you know, back on May 10th, 2018, I got the Naltraxone pallet inserted in me for my opiod and Kratom cravings which were unbearable. 

Today I had to run a few errands and was driving past the smoke shop where I would get my Kratom. Because I needed cigarettes, I pulled into the parking lot, got out of my car and walked into the store. My eyes went directly to where the Kratom was. Because I've been a customer of that shop for a long time, the clerk asked me where I've been and said ""one?' as he was reaching for the Kratom extract. I said ""nope, just a pack of Marlboro red."" The cravings were almost non existent. It was amazing.

"Last Saturday was my 10 year anniversary of quitting World of Warcraft cold turkey
I was browsing my [Facebook ""On this day""](https://imgur.com/a/GpBkg) and stumbled across a status I made 10 years prior, celebrating ""beating the addiction.""  I know some think video games can't be an addiction, but at the time I was playing 12-14 hours per day, 7 days per week.  WoW cost me my fiance, my job, many of my friends, and even relationships with some of my family members.  I racked up student debt because I was completely living off of it, since I would skip work, or leave early to participate in raids.  I put on 60 pounds and topped out at  Even on the rare occasions that I would go out with friends, I would often be texting with other people I knew who I played WoW with (even though I didn't know any of them in real life).

I can distinctly remember my 23rd birthday, my fiance got a bunch of friends together to go out to BW3s for my birthday.  My guild had been bashing our heads on Vaelstrasz (second boss in Blackwing Lair) for almost two weeks, and were finally about to beat him.  All I could think about that night was how much I wanted to be there, raiding with my guildmates, and the loot I wanted to drop.  By the time I quit, I had right around 450 days played between all of my alts.  To put that in mathematical perspective, WoW had been out barely over three years by the time I quit.  That's just over 1100 days.  In other words, I spent around 41% of my life, for three years, playing that game.

Older, wiser me knows that you never truly beat addiction to something completely, you just win each battle one day at a time.  So here I am now, 10 years and two days clean.  Since then I've finished my bachelor's degree, become gainfully employed, I'm happily married, and have lost all of the weight that I put on, and been a part time CrossFit coach for the last three years, in addition to my full time job.  I still play video games, just far more casually now, and no more MMOs.  The itch to play WoW is still there; it's always calling to me, but I've made promises to my wife and to myself that I'd never pick it up again, and I intend to stay true to that promise."

I had gone around 8 months without smoking meth. Last time I had done it was around New Years, 2016. In these 8 months I have drank and I have smoked weed about 3-4 times, in social settings. A few beers doesn't seem to hurt, and I've scared myself straight (stupidly) with a DUI. I do tend to get depressed and drink to feel better, but I understand it's a temporary fix, so I now refuse to get out of control with that. Unfortunately, I feel as if I don't have a reliable group of friends. They all DO smoke constantly and drink constantly and it is very hard to be around them and feel like I fit in. They say they enjoy my company, but honestly I just feel like a shell when I'm around them and it's not my place to tell them that their habits make me uncomfortable. I should simply not be around it, but it is hard when I feel as if I don't have anyone else to be around.

But this is about the meth, mostly. I am losing my train of thought... I only had one hit tonight when I met up with some people to do the whole gay-pnp stuff. It is a ritual. I don't smoke otherwise, and it seems I have more than one addiction and now it looks like porn is really becoming an issue. Heavy porn use has probably contributed to this, but as well as not feeling like I am ""enjoying"" my sexuality as much as everyone else. I feel very sexually stunted. It just seems to stem all from such a young age. There's so much here that I don't feel comfortable posting but I have had an extremely strange and regretful sexual adolescence, to say the least. I just feel so alone. I'm looking for ways to put the blame on others but I am the only one to blame for the situation I'm in. I just feel so much regret. Suicide really is just a daily thought. I feel bombarded with negativity all around me on a daily basis and just the unforgiving nature of reality. I really wish I didn't relapse tonight, I wish I could have gone a full year. I wish I had felt enough satisfaction from quitting for 8 months that I would not have done it tonight, but apparently, I that wasn't enough for me.

"659 days clean.
I've never been on this reddit before but I just wanted to give y'all some hope. I was a severe cocaine and Xanax abuser who stole, robbed and fought for money to keep my addiction fed. I was 22 years old living at home and had dropped out of college, and had been in and out of jail. I had lost all my friends and and family except for my father. I finally took his last straw by selling his prized watch for quite a bit of money. I had the option of rehab or some lengthy jail time, and I chose to get help. I remember think people with 30 days were nuts but it's possible. I've lost many people since I've got clean to overdoses and suicides that could have easily been me. My life has made a complete turn around in such a short time and it's a blessing. I am back in college, just moved into a home with my girlfriend and I am working for a new start up rehab facility that is a big name in my neck of the woods. I get some people come off the street at their lowest point and see them leave feeling more happy and hopeful than they have in years. It never ceases to amaze me the amount of change that happens in recovery.
    There will be long hard days but there will be twice as many days that you wish would last longer so you could have more time to take in all the amazing thing that happen after getting clean. If you need help or are struggling while in recovery talk to someone, or open your big book and read, it has saved my life many times. Thank all of you for uplifting posts about how things have changed or gotten better for you. It truly brings joy to my heart. "
"Day 12 Still sober!! Still tired. But better today.
5am is still not a bedtime. But I was up at 130pm. Much better. First cup of coffee down. Time with baby was awesome. I'm actually excited to get to a meeting today. My oldest daughter called. She has this beautiful little boy she wants to take to the fair. So she called me. She called me for money so she could go. And you know what I told her? I told her, sure. I'll send you $40 now and after my meeting and grocery shopping I'll send you more. Do you know how long it's been since I could freely seems cash to my kid?

"Christmas Day 2016 is my 2 year sobriety anniversary. I made a short list of things I learned along the way.
1. There is no such thing as rock bottom. I can always end up somewhere worse, unless I'm dead.

2. If I think to myself ""If x happened, I would get clean"", then I'm not really interested in getting clean.

3. I became a better liar, a better manipulator, and a better thief, when my addiction was on the line.

4. The first time I told someone, I didn't feel relieved, I felt scared. That fear never went away.

5. I didn't even trust my own promises, so how could I expect others to trust in them?

6. Recovery. Is. So. Goddamned. Slow.

7. Celebrate each day as if it were a 1 year anniversary.

8. A bad day sober is still 10 times better than the worst day high.

9. Planning for the future helps me forget about the past.

10. If they are still my friend, hold them close, thank them as often as possible, and never let go, because they loved me more than I loved myself.


I hope this helps you guys, even a little. My experience was different though. I was addicted from 2008-2014, on and off, where I would have 6-7 really bad months, then a month clean. I ran out of money, lost jobs, lost family. I ended up with a criminal record. The moment I decided to get clean was prompted by something you might see as silly... a moment with my aging and arthritic dog, where I couldn't help him get up the stairs because my arms were too weak. I know it sounds stupid, but it was in that moment I realized that I couldn't care for anyone, least of all myself, and I needed to change. No matter what your reason is, stick with it. Remember it."
"Days clean!
Today is 5 fucking hundred days clean. There is always hope for us guys! Take it one day at a time!"
"If my recovery had a slogan, it would either be ""Okay"" or ""Fine.""
""You have a problem, you need to go to treatment."" Okay. ""No, you probably shouldn't leave rehab after just 3 days."" Fine. ""Wanna try this program? Maybe get yourself a sponsor?"" Okay. 

Ive managed to stay clean well over a year on basically a series of okays, fines, sures, and why nots. It started with a scared, intense, and honestly skeptical willingness, but turned in to this loving laid back idea. My willingness to do this originally was like a 6 year old screaming with his eyes shut, *finally* doing his chores because he had run out of all other options. Now my recovery looks more like a welcome shrug and a ""sure, why not?""

If you're new to recovery, and you're not sure if you want to do this, that's okay. If you're not sure if you even *can* do this, that's okay too- I didn't think I could either. But when I had worked myself in to a corner, and I had NO other options, I found myself willing to dip my toes in the water. And man, I'm glad I did it. The water's warm in recovery, come on in."
"One year!
So today is my anniversary and I've finally hut that one year mark. I try hard to be humble but holy shit I can't help but feel really good about myself today! I've never been one to feel proud of myself until today. I can't stop smiling at work. 

To everyone and anyone that might be struggling, IT IS POSSIBLE. I didn't believe it for the longest time, and it took a ton of failures for it to finally hit me. I got a therapist week I see every week, checked in to IOP and went in with an open mind and decided not to defend myself in any accounts. I used to hide and numb my feelings for my entire adult life, so when I actually started to feel emotions it was overwhelming and a complete shock to sit with those feelings all the way through. But I kept being self aware and kept talking to myself knowing not picking up was the only way I can live the life I know I'm capable of. 

Please, don't ever give up, I'm no first time winner. I've ""lost"" too many times before, but when I look back with a clear head I realize now how each ""failure"" taught me something new. If anyone has any questions, wants to talk, or even vent without an answer, please don't hesitate to pm me. I love you all, let's work together to stay sober ❤"

"The promises do come true!
I have been in recovery for 26 months from an opioid addiction that lead to my being terminated from my dream job/career. My addiction was devastating on its own, but losing the job that was supporting my family was one of the worst repercussions of using. I'd gone to graduate school with the support of my husband (he literally paid for it and worked while I went full time) so that when I finished he could retire. And retire he did, 6 months after I started working. Things were going well for several years until my actions caught up with me.

The reason for my termination has followed me for the past 22 months. Every application I've filled out, I've had to list the exact reason I was let go (a requirement of disclosure in my profession) and that has led to nothing but rejection. It's been disheartening. We went into debt so I could go to treatment and we're still paying it off little by little. I had to cash out my retirement. I've been without health insurance (I was also covering my husband through my employer)--the list goes on, the absolute mess I made.

Finally--last week, an employer decided I was worth it. A second chance. I will finally be on the road back to success in my career. I've been steadily working on recovery during these past 26 months and every area of my life (marriage, family, kids) has improved so much--the only thing missing was a job. I was almost ready to give up.

I feel like I've been smiled upon at last for continuing to do the next right thing. I wanted to share a hopeful experience for others who might be thinking that recovery isn't worth it. It absolutely is."
"My Drug Abuse Story
I have been getting caught up in psychedelics drugs recently, Shrooms, LSD, DMT, anything to keep me in that good vibe. I used these drugs as an outlet for my problems, issues, relationship troubles, anything that hurt me. I know that drugs are bad, and I continue to do them, I don't understand why I can't stop or get some help from someone, usually people ward me off, telling me to just continue and not worry about it. I know Reddit is the last place I should go to for help... I've had suicidal thoughts recently, and I just need help. You don't have to comment, just Upvote so I can know you care at least."
"Six months clean and serene.
And today marks 6 months clean from IV meth, heroin, and alcohol. My longest clean time yet!

If you're wondering if recovery works...Today, I never get hangovers, dope sick, or psychosis. I have a home, car, job, and friends that actually care about me. I'm no longer degraded and used, I have dignity today. I live a life of serenity and hope, not of violence, sickness and insanity. I have a baby on the way who will not be born addicted to drugs, and will never see mom under the influence. I think the biggest change of all is that I have hope for the future. My obsession to use has been lifted. I take part in my recovery today instead of taking up a space in NA while I waited for my next bag. Miracles happen!"
"The Craving is a memory, and The Memory is a Trick.
Heard this from a drug counselor who ran group sessions for cocaine addicts for many years, and has seen every story or heard every excuse a hundred times over. 

He told me that no craving ever caused a relapse. Cravings are normal human behavior, and there is no way to stop them. It's the ""permission-giving thoughts"" that cause relapses when we give in to the craving. But you don't have to let cravings overpower you when you understand what they are. 

Cravings for food or shelter or sex are natural, and hardwired into our human brains. Those needs are necessary for survival and will always be there. The craving for cocaine is artificial, we have inserted it there, and it may never go away completely, but it will lose strength over time. 

Do not fear a craving, for they are bound to happen. Consider a craving to be a Memory, a recollection of how good it was to fill a need. And remember that for all needs, all cravings, the brain remembers that fulfillment by highlighting the pleasure, and downplaying the pain. This is an important survival instinct for humans, to remember, for example, how good the prey tasted while forgetting how dangerous it was to hunt for it.

The Craving is a Memory, but your brain remembers it with bias, telling you it was mostly good, and not much bad. For the human needs and natural cravings, this is good. For the artificial cravings for drugs, this is a trick. Because the pleasure of being high is not worth the damage to our bodies and the pain of losing our relationships. Remember that.

Do not fear the Craving. It will come, sure enough. But it's just a Memory of how it used to be, and the Memory is distorted to favor the pleasure and forget the pain. 

The Craving for drugs may turn up in a week, or 2 months, or 5 years, or 30 years. But it's just the Memory of an artificial need, and your brain is tricking you to forget the pain. Now that you can see how the trick works, you can stop falling for it."

"One Year
I never would have thought that it was possible for me to live a clean life. One year ago I thought I needed drugs/alcohol in order to survive. To say that my life was controlled by drugs is an understatement.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I have been seeing shrinks since I was 9 and been on different medications for such things. I did not think that it was possible for me to be happy, much less without the medications or drugs.

A great big thank you to NA for my life, family, and happiness I never knew was possible.

"One Year Sober,
And while I feel overwhelming gratitude and accomplishment for this anniversary, it also feels just like any other day. 

I'm just hanging out at my apartment, which I rent with my best friend I met out here in the midwest. I'm hanging out with our new kitty on the couch, before heading to a job I love. I just went to a meeting a block from my home, a first step meeting, which is always humbling. 

I can't begin to describe how full of joy I am for all the gifts sobriety has given me. My family loves me and trusts me- they want to be a part of my life. I have wonderful friends, both ""normal"" and in recovery, and I can't thank them enough for everything they've done for me since moving across the country to get sober. 

I had to change *everything* to have what I have today. And today, everything seems so... normal. It's just any other day. I'm taking care of myself, I work the steps, I work full time, I go on adventures with friends, I try to love with all my heart and let go of judgment, etc. etc., and when I romanticize the chaos that addiction brings, I remind myself that nothing compares to how good things are today. 

22 years old, never thought sobriety would be a way of life for me, let alone a fun one. Changed my people, places, and things, and the gifts of sobriety followed. And they continue to follow me.

"A moment of silence for those that still suffer, and those that suffer no longer
A little more than 4 years ago my family decided they were tired if watching me commit slow (but rapidly accelerating) suicide with drugs and booze. They had no idea what to do, so they called a rehab. The rehab gave them the name of a man who could help them get me to get some help. He was an interventionist. They couldn't pay him up front his normal fee, but he said not to worry, they could pay him what they could, when they could. He was scheduled to come do it on a Sunday, but they were so worried about me dying they begged him to come a day early, so he did. He got it all organized, helped them write their letters, got it all ready a day early. After they read them, he sat with me out back while I smoked and thought about the choice I had been offered. He told me he had been addicted to heroin and booze, and that there was a better way. He let me listen to Pink Floyd on the way to the hospital and helped me check myself in.

I ran I to him a few times, as I began to get my life back together. Then when I went to a meeting to take my 6 month chip, at an AA meeting at the hospital I had gone to for rehab, I saw him, wearing a patient bracelet. After 9 years sober, he had relapsed, only a three day run, but it had ended with him overdosed on a bus bench. 

I rarely heard from him after that. I'd heard from mutual acquaintances in the recovery community that he was struggling.

This morning my sponsor called me. He told me Jeff, my interventionist, was found dead in a flea bag motel in Tijuana. 

I don't know what else to say about this. I tried to share it on my Facebook, but those people don't really get it. They're all saying things like ""be strong"" and ""we're their for you"" as though this is a threat to my sobriety. They couldn't be more wrong. This man gave me the two greatest gifts to my recovery. First, he shared his story with me and convinced me that maybe, just maybe, there was a way out, and with his death he gives me a reminder that I must be forever vigilant, because no matter what, I will never be completely cured, it will never be safe for me to use drugs or alcohol.

Thanks for letting me share."
"Picked up my 2 month chip today!
Hi, I'm Matthew and I'm an addict/alcoholic.

I am very grateful to have sixty days clean and sober today! It definitely hasn't been an easy road, especially with my step three, but I am very excited to move forward with my newly found relationship with my higher power whom I choose to call God. I'm currently on my fourth step and I am excited to continue on with my journey. I couldn't have done it without prayer and meditation, and all you folks who fill the rooms every night. Somebody shared something in a meeting today that I really got down with- Our common peril and common solution allows us to speak to each other heart to heart, a language that only only we can truly understand. As hokey as it sounds, I think it's very true and I'm very grateful for the fellowship I've found in AA/CA.

"I'm not giving up
I've written here before during one of my worse relapses. I'm sober this time. An hour ago I walked home from a nightclub. Left my boyfriend and friend to enjoy themselves and allowed myself to do what was best for me. See, I didn't want to drink. Hell, I didn't even want to do drugs. I definitely didn't want to be in a crowded place. I was already dissociating badly and feeling incredibly anxious to be there. My boyfriend told me I could get any drug I wanted, he thought that'd make me feel better. A week ago I would've been ecstatic about that. I would have fooled myself thinking that drugs could make me feel better. They don't actually make me feel better. All drugs have truly done for me is destroy me. That's what I wanted. It's all been for the most part to be self destructive. Even when it's been fun. Thing is I'm done hurting myself. 

I want to be sober. I've done cocaine, speed, MDMA, weed in the past month though. I've been continuing using just because I felt like I had to, if that makes sense. It took some time to understand that I actually don't want to use anymore. A couple of months ago I went on yet another crazy and long speed bender where I really messed up. Almost to the point where I lost everything. But I didn't. I was forgiven and given another chance. That changed something in me even though I'd done it all before. I guess this was just the last straw for me.

Last time I was high was last weekend. Smoked weed again after a long break. I've only smoked a couple of times this year. I used to smoke chronically. I wanted to know what it was like again. And oh boy, it was just too much and yet not enough.

Every time I've been high lately it's been either overwhelming or disappointing. I guess I'm over seeing drugs with heart shaped glasses, you know. Every day I've woken up sober again I've been happy and relieved to be sober. Even if I'm dealing with severe mental illness and my life is a mess I still am happy to be sober. I can't believe that this just happened on its own. I tried to force this change and turns out it just happened when I wasn't trying to force it. You know, for over a year I've wanted nothing but to be high. I used to be convinced that I couldn't deal with being sober. That it's awful to be sober. Well, turns out it's freaking amazing to be sober. To be in control of yourself is the best thing there is.

Walking home I realised that drugs can't give me what I want. I don't even know what I want. I've been looking for something my whole life, something to fill the void. And now I'm starting to accept that I don't need to fill it. Not like this, chasing madly after something I can't even define. All this time I thought I was chasing happiness, sanity, whatever. Now it's clear to me I've been chasing the exact opposite. I've been hurting and hurting myself, wondering why I feel so empty and broken. I've been breaking myself and continuing this awful cycle. I don't want to do that anymore. Be it drugs or other things, I'm done doing that to myself.


I don't want to fool myself with the idea of casual use. I can't do that. When I use I want to keep going until I pull myself inside out. Until I get to a point where I slowly but surely slip into another psychotic break. I get there even without drugs so it's time to stop doing things that push me there quicker. I don't want that anymore. I don't want to fall apart. I don't want to hit the bottom because I've already sunk lower than I ever thought I could and  I know now that I can always go lower. And I just don't want to do that anymore. I'm climbing back up every day. I'll probably stumble on the way but I'll keep going on. Even if I fall down badly I'll keep going on.

I'm not giving up. I'll be frank. A couple of weeks ago I had yet another suicide attempt planned. Been there, done that way too many times. This time it would've been successful 100%. Figured out a way. Ah but something changed. An opportunity to start a new life was offered to me and that was enough to make me fight against that urge to kill myself. It's not easy and I'm not really happy most of the time. I don't think that matters though. What matters is that I live. Every day I fight against this suicidalness in me. I know it will go away again. And come back. But I have control over myself as long as I stay sober and that's truly amazing to realise. 

I just wanted to share these thoughts and this change in me and this is the best place for it, I think.

Keep fighting.

But I always go to my home group. I am still the treasurer and the secretary. I still have a sponsor, and although slowly, I still work the steps. I keep coming back, because I know, if I stop, I will use. 

It works. I was in and out for 4 years before I finally realized , I had to stop. So I did 90 in 90, I got a sponsor, I got a home group, I dumped all my problems on people after the meeting. I would tell war stories with other newcomers until I felt it in my body. I went to a ton of meetings. I was determined.

"Four Years
Four years ago I overdosed for my third time. Four years ago I watched my best friend overdose and die. Four years ago I decided that I was sick of sitting in the back of cop cars, of spending time in jail, of burying my friends, of waking up in the hospital, of wasting away.

I wasn't sure I could ever get sober. I had spent two years trying. I had a year sober once upon a time and had relapsed hard after a failed relationship - a petty reason in the grand scheme of things, but I wanted any reason to return to my best friend. I decided I'd likely die with a needle in my arm. But four years ago I put that needle down and said that last goodbye to my friend heroin.

I did the impossible - or so I thought - and got sober again.
I stayed sober through long days at work, rejection from friends, fights with family, the loss of a job, mental health issues, loneliness, the loss of my first child. I never thought I'd stay sober. But here I am.

Today is my four years clean and sober.

"Three Weeks Clean Today!
I know it may not seem like a lot compared to other people's milestones, but I am so proud to say I've been completely sober for three weeks!

It all started with weed and drinking, which then lead to a benzodiazepine addiction and frequent usage of DXM. I was combining multiple drugs daily and was never sober for more than a day. 

Recently I overdosed on diphenhydramine (benadryl), and had to be hospitalized. This was when I finally realized that my drug use was not just hurting myself, but people close to me. I was lying and hiding things from my friends and family. I isolated myself from most of my family members and disappointed them immensely. 

This Subreddit has helped me so much in realizing that you really need to want to be clean to get sober. Like I said, three weeks is not a lot compared to others but I feel great. It's like a huge weight has been lifted. I just wanted to remind everyone to never give up! Although things may seem tough, you will turn out a better person in the end."

"To those of you who were sober today, thank you.
I'm not an alcoholic, but I'm in love with one who's almost at one year of sobriety. We are an amazing team, an amazing couple, but could not be without sobriety and people out there like you in meetings and in recovery. Thanks to AA, AlAnon, and the support of family and friends we are healthy and healthy to each other. Whoever is out there and is sober today, even if today is the first day, I want to say thank you for being a part of something so amazing: the readiness to change; to let go of the fear of what is and embrace the wonder of what can be. 

To J.E.H., you are my other half and all I could ever hope for, with all of your imperfections I love you and I'm so happy you are sober today. "
"Something I realized today...
Something I Realized Today;

About 10 years ago (what seems to be like 100 years ago), i finally admitted to myself that I had an addiction to alcohol and drugs. It was to the point that I almost couldn't function in society for a single day without drinking or putting something into my body to alter my mind.

It took a long time to lead up to me admitting this to myself. I spent countless nights drinking myself into oblivion, would wake up at 3:00am or 4:00am and reach for an opened can of beer that I would keep on my floor right next to my bed just to take a sip of the warm flat liquid which was my life, scraping up change to buy my next 12-pack, so, that while I was drinking it, I would sit there thinking about where I was going to get money for my next 12-pack, getting up early for work so I was able to slam a couple of drinks just to get the courage to go out in the world and face everyone,....etc..etc . And this went on and on.

I finally got the help I needed and put myself in a rehab. I was in a rehab during the 9-11 attacks on the world trade center. So, my life changed in more ways than one. It wasn't easy at first, and, it took me some time to find myself and to try to make a plan on what i was going to do for the rest of my life. I (for the most part) was doing the ""baby step"" approach. Step 1 - A place to sleep at night. Step 2 - Attending my AA Meetings. Step 3 - Holding a job (this was a big step as I was never able to do this before). Step 4 - Move out of my fathers house and get my own apartment, and so on and so forth.

So, 9+ years later. Here I am. My wonderful wife stayed with me through this entire ordeal (At the time of my rehab, we weren't married, but, she was with me). We have a good life today. We bought a home. She has a good job. I have a good job and (very often) get awards for my performance at work. I've always wanted to work in the I.T. field (With Computers), so, I put my mind to it, and, that is the position I am in today in a very large corporation.

Just last month, a person that i worked with (A Director of Customer Services) left the company. She wasn't happy working here. So, she made a phone call to me asking if she can use me as a reference for a new job. This is the entire purpose of me writing this note.

What I realized : Almost 10 years ago, I was barely able to walk to the store OR hold any kind of a job because of the alcoholic/drug addicted mess I was, and, now, A director of a large company that I work for actually wants to use me as a reference. Not to mention that my company also sent oe to Amarillo Texas for 2 weeks because they trusted that i can do a great job while there. Trusted ""me"".

To the average person, this may not seem like much. But, from where I was, this is a huge accomplishment for me.

I just wanted to remind everyone out there that is in recovery that there is hope. You just have to stay strong and take things 1 day at a time.

"My husband, former IV heroin user wants to use painkillers recreationally
I need advice. 

My husband was an IV heroin addicts for years (maybe 7? I’m not sure) he was on suboxone when we got together and he was on it for a total of 3 years. 

He got off the suboxone 16 months ago.

Since then he has talked about wanting to do opiates (Percocet, Vicodin, hydrocone etc). His friend offered him some today and he is planning on picking them up today after work. 

The only reason I know this is because I was working on the computer when the messages popped up from his Facebook account. 

Every other time I have pleaded and begged him not to because I am so worried about him relapsing and ruining our lives. He has been to prison as a by product of his addiction and went to rehab something like 8 times.

I cannot imagine him being in the throes of addiction because I cannot imagine him hurting the people that he loves. I love my husband so much. There is so much about addiction I do not understand. 

I have done lots of reading and research. 

In my opinion, he should not use opiates recreationally because it has the potential to be catastrophic for us. I would never put our family in the position to hurt us and I can’t understand why he is willing to take that risk. 

 I think he need to put US First and not his wants and needs. 

He says it will be fine because he is different now, and he isn’t as weak as I think he is. 

I think he shouldn’t be putting his recovery in jeopardy. He insists that he just wants to feel good. I insist that he needs different and better coping mechanisms.

I would go to the literal ends of the earth for my husband. Everything I do in life I do for us to have a better future. 

He says he hates that I won’t let him be himself by using opiates recreationally. I know his addiction is something that will have to be managed forever and I knew that coming into this marriage. 

He is acting so flippant about using again because “it will only be once in a while”. How can I get him to see that is is wrong and that he could ruin our relationship?

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with a spouse going through this?? It’s like I can’t reason with him and he thinks that he’s just cured of his addiction now so he can do it again. That because he’s had a steady life since we’ve been together that he’s better now. All those things have only happened because of his sobriety. How can I help him??? 

I’m so scared. 

I’m sorry if you think I am being dramatic but this is a big deal to me. 

EDIT:

Thank you for all the advice. He DID NOT go pick it up. 
We have a lot of work to do moving forward. I would ideally like to get both of us in therapy both separately and together. We are going through a stressful time right now as we are moving entirely across the state so that I can begin law school.  I think that fear of the unknown can be a big trigger.  I would also like to say that I would not have left him if he did go pick it up. However, if he chooses his addiction over me I do realize there will come a time when that choice would need to be made.

"24 hours... 30 days, 60 days, 90 days... 6 months, 9 months... 1 year!
Today I hit 1 year! I don't have many people in my life who understand what a big deal it is... But I know many of you reading this can.

PS - it's truly amazing that the day I chose to seek sobriety, and begin the fight for freedom from my addiction, coincides with the day so many are celebrating their freedom. "

"Eight years of Xanax and finally had enough
I was 18 when I decided to get medicated for my anxiety. Boy was I naive. I thought Xanax could cure it all when in reality I really didn't need it as much as I thought. I am an addict and the reality is that it was just another thing I could abuse.

I had ramped up to about 7mg a day rather quickly (all this being prescribed. my psychiatrist had extensive research into using xanax for relief of anxiety) . I have been on that regiment for around 7 years until recent. Reflecting on this time, people didn't know the true me anymore, emotions were sparse and I didn't even realize or care to realize even. I never had to deal with problems because I never saw anything AS a problem. This proved difficult with relationships for me. I was an emotional ""zombie""

In the past year I had slowly been weening off my 7mg a day down to about 1mg. I admit, I stayed in this range because I was afraid of what the world is like without this medication. The fear was too strong. I had become weak from not knowing what it is like to deal with everyday problems because I had become a zombie .I even got completely off it over the summer for about 3 weeks and had a pretty brutal panic attack and that's all it took to get me back on it. Back to 1mg and all that work was gone.

This year is a turning point. I had finally decided that enough was enough and I didn't need to rely on this medication any more.

I dropped my dosage to .5 for a few months before and finally quit all together on February 3, 2017.

The past 2 months have been a blur. A mix of depression and anxiety clutter my thoughts. Being completely off Xanax has been one of the toughest things ever.

Mainly large amounts of regret, seemingly stuck on remembering embarassing moments or regretful decisions. This is the hardest. It seems that I must relearn everything again, how to feel and react in situations. The inner monologue is ever more present.

My sense of smell and taste has dramatically changed. I notice a lot more details in every smell... every food. Some beers I've had I cannot drink anymore because of the intense flavor.

I notice things about myself I never noticed before, certain ticks come out. I am very sensitive to external stimuli, bright lights make me jolt. Sometimes I have jolts just out of nowhere. Loud / sharp noises startle me more. I attibute all of this to the withdrawals but am left wondering if maybe it is an unrelated issue I have.. I am irritable and my thoughts are everywhere (as seen in the writing above even, how much I jump around from thought to thought). Feeling crippled by anxiety I wonder if I'll ever get to a point where I do not have to let it control my present mindset. I practice being mindful and letting myself know that what I fear / regret will not help me in the present but just to try to learn from my experiences to better myself.

I will say that my anxiety spikes a lot when smoking THC. I have been smoking since I was a teenager and I guess I am now realizing what it really does to me. I am not sure if this will pass in time, but I guess I am slowly breaking away from my excessive smoking habits because of the negative effects of it. I get stuck in my head more than ever, finding it harder to break free of the spell of panic. I was reading another post and saw that someone had success with CBD so I think I will try that. I have had moderate success in the past with it.

I dont know what I'm looking for by writing this, or if anyone will even make it to this part. But I guess I just wanted to share my experience thus far. I just discovered this subreddit and, until now, I didn't have any way to relate to how I am feeling. I generally do not post at all about anything, but I am stepping out of my comfort zones in hopes that this helps me...or even anyone else for that matter. I am happy knowing that there is a place where I can relate to others on this road to recovery. I am leaving giant holes in my story but will fill in any gaps if anyone is interested enough. It's a long road ahead of me, but I just need to keep being patient with myself and remember to live in the present. Thank you for listening to my story.

I've just come home from my weekly meeting, and I'm feeling so lost.
We read step one from the green and gold tonight, I chose the reading myself. I'm three years clean and I haven't worked step one, or two, or three, or... you get the picture. 
Partly my problems with working the program have come from the lack of recovery community in my area, it's one small meeting a week and I'm almost the only woman, no ladies with more clean time than me to ask to sponsor me...
But mostly my problem has been a lack of commitment to what I know I should be doing I suppose.
I'm three years clean and I'm scared. I'm thinking about using. My addiction is rearing it's head in other areas and I can see that my relationship with food right now is mirroring how my relationship with drugs used to be. I'm trying to control my feelings and unmanageability with restricting food or overeating. 
And I can't share. I can't talk to my friends in the fellowship. I realised toight I have never really honestly shared and spoken about myself or my feelings.
I'm so scared and I feel like I'm falling. 
I realise this probably isn't the right forum for what is probably just a meaningless rant, but I wanted to talk to someone tonight, and I just couldn't open my mouth in the meeting, I hopes it's ok that I came here. I'm not asking for anything exactly, I really just wanted to share, and this was the only way I felt able.

"this day in 1989
on April 10 1989 I came to feeling as miserable as I had ever felt.
I had been to treatment a couple months before and had stopped using drugs. I had been going to my meetings, but I had been vainly trying to drink between meetings thinking ""I know I cant take drugs, but surely I can drink with control"". 

I remembered my intentions of the night before to drink one rum and coke and get a nice buzz and stop. But a half a fifth of bicardi 151 later and sick and miserable I realized I had no more control with alcohol than I did with narcotics.

I did something that I had never done before in my 24 years of life.

I got down on my knees and prayed. I asked God as I then understood him to keep me clean and sober for that day. 

I have been drug and alcohol free since that day. It has not always been easy, but life has been better by far than it was back then.

I have been allowed to experience something somewhat rare. I have now been in recovery for more than half my life at 48 years old. I have been in recovery and clean and sober for twice as long as I used drugs and alcohol.

All by Gods grace the principles, steps and fellowship of the program."

"AA works, if you work it!
I have not seen a lot of new posts on here so I decided to make one just to see something new. 

I guess I'll share a little about my story and recovery.

I am 21 years old and started my sobriety almost 6 months ago (March 20th I will have 6 months), and this time has been the best time of my life. AA has given me new real friends, the ability to be useful in the lives of others (I have a commitment at my home group) and a sense of belonging for the first time in my life.

Ever since I can remember, I have felt different from everyone around me and always sought to fit in.  When I found alcohol and drugs at the age of 14, i thought I found acceptance and had the ""i had arrived"" moment many members talk about.  I was never a ""normal drinker,"" I drank for the effect and always drank to become drunk.  I did this until I was 20 years old (a short, but destructive career) and found my own bottom. I lost enough in my life to make the decision to surrender myself to AA and allow them to show me how to stop my drinking and work on my thinking.

Today, I am in a completely different place I was when I was still out running. Today, I am happy, joyous and free from the shackles of alcohol and drugs. I live one day at a time, call/work with my sponsor, go to meetings (and even lead one), makes calls to my network of young guys, and try to be a better person then I was the day before.  I look forward to growing in the light of my Higher Power and doing what I am suppose to do, not what I want to do.

"Forgot to write this saturday was 3 years clean for me :D
I had been sober from 16 to 22, then I relapsed and were drunk from 22-23 and during my relapse I also abused pills, anti-anxiety, anti-depressants and also sleeping pills.
So december 15th, 3 years ago, to get rid of the pain, I overdosed on a loooot of pills together with about a half a liter of vodka or so, I woke up about 2 days later covered in vomit, so I guess I didn't choke on it.
And well, from that day on I've been sober again, first time I was sober I did it on my own and this time I took help from my local addiction clinic.

I had been treated for depression since I was 18, but it was just 1 year ago I was actually diagnosed with bipolar and have the correct medication.
So I think this time will be different. 1 year to go, then I'm on a record spree.

Hope I inspired someone. :)"

"A feeling only addicts can know...
I'm on vacation, and visited my first home group ever today.  I haven't been in the area for about 6 years.  As I walked into the meeting (which was in a new venue), I ran into a buddy that I met in my first meeting ever.  He's celebrating 27 years next week, and I celebrated 11 years in May.  We chatted, and looked around the room together...

There were maybe 3 or 4 people that were in that group of about 40 that were there when we both attended meetings together every day.  There was only one other guy in the room that was there when I got clean.

If you don't remember anything else about your fellowship or Recovery in general, remember this:  It's not a social club.  It's not a way to meet people simply to make friends.  IT'S ABOUT SAVING YOUR LIFE one day at a time.  The disease of addiction kills... and sometimes we're lucky enough for it to only be actual bodily death.  For many of us, our spirit was dead for a long time before we made our first meeting.  I don't ever want to be back in that spot again.  So I remember.  I remember tht I'm allowed to fuck up in recovery.  I remember that there's ONLY ONE THING I HAVE TO DO PERFECTLY, and that is to accept, balls to bones, that I am an addict.  That first part of the first step, the acceptance that I am an addict and knowing what that means.

When you stay in recovery long enough, you will see people die.  Some simply from age.  Some from misfortune.  Some from relapse.

And some simply disappear.

So, in that moment, my old friend and I looked at each other and were thankful.  Thankful that we had been beaten down enough to be willing to do whatever it took to not pick up again.

It was a powerful feeling."
"Ninety-two days sober, made conscious contact with my higher power before I did my third step, have had the obsession gratefully removed, and just punched my fourth step in the face in two days. 
Just wanted to share that. 

I actually had a day that, in the past, would have driven me to drink or use as well as flip the fuck out, but the thought to drink didn't even cross my mind until I realized I didn't even need/ want to well after the hectic shit had passed. 

The day was like some kind of hurdle relay: I had one thing work-related come up and I'd start stressing and figuratively hit my knees, and the stress left me. Then something else came up, started stressing a minute, pray, gone. Then ex-wife stress, rinse,repeat. Something else, same deal. 

I was being tested like a motherfucker today, and I have been given the tools to beat that shit. 

Thirty-four days of program and I really am living a life beyond my wildest dreams and I know this is nothing. 

Something else I'd like to share: 
I've been a very codependent person and have been a serial monogamist. Last night it dawned on me, and I don't know when the change happened, but I realized that I want a little goofball sponsee more than I want a girlfriend. That is an amazing place to be for me.

"Celebrated ONE YEAR CLEAN yesterday, and cried like a baby. Has anyone else gotten super emotional when getting to milestone?
Just discovered this subreddit thanks to my bf who is also in recovery. Love the stuff I have read so far!

Yesterday marked one whole year from my clean date. (I can still hardly believe it.) Went to a noon meeting to celebrate, and after getting my lovely glow-in-the-dark keychain and hug, and introduce myself, I slowly dissolved into a crying mess. I had already been congratulated by several people close to me, which made me happy, but I don't think the full reality of what I had accomplished hit me until that moment. It's so weird because certain time periods really dragged on for me. For example, I'm pretty sure the time period when I had four months clean actually occurred over a two and a half year period. Overall, I feel like that whole year went so quick!

Has anyone else been overcome with emotion when hitting a big milestone?"

"IT DOES WORK....I am living proof.
Hey everyone my name is randomlurker82 and I am an addict.

You know what though? I am an addict with 5 years clean. 5 years ago today, right around this time, I was taking my first shower in a month, at a detox in the south end of Boston, where I had been lucky enough to get a no-insurance bed in the dead of fuckin winter. I was tired, cold, filthy, dopesick, and had hit the bottom. I was 23 years old and it was my 3rd time going to detox. I was only going because my SO had gotten locked up the previous morning and I had promised him if he ever got locked up again I would go into treatment and wait for him so he would know where I was and so I could get an apartment and job so we would be able to be stable when he got out of jail. (I know, what a deal...he wanted all the benefits while I got all the work.) 

Anyhow, I went from that detox, to a holding, to a halfway house in a city I had never laid eyes on. I thought I was only going to be there for a few months. 5 years later I am still here. I have a job, a place to live, a great network (albeit a small one), and I am totally overwhelmed. This was my first try living the program and it works. I went from a 23 year old gutter junkie, to where I am now.

Sometimes I question what is it that I constantly desire escape from. Coming up on 9 months of sobriety, I'm still battling with my addictive personality. Relentlessly seeking out and exploiting any external thing I can derive even a modicum of pleasure from. Whether it's my newfound girlfriend, video games, incessant listening of music, food, pornography, sports, sex, etc. all of it provides a distraction. A means of temporarily alleviating some sense of discontentment within my life. Albeit substances have now been eliminated as a source of escapism, the familiar thought patterns and behaviors still persist. 

8 and a half months, I got expelled from school. 4 months of sobriety vanished within an instant as soon as an acquaintance offered to smoke a joint on school grounds. The same day, I was asked to leave the school and within 10 days was back in rehab. Since then, I diligently worked a 12 step program and managed to obtain some sense of stability in my life. I now live in Singapore and study psychology in a private uni, the equivalent of a community college. 

The last month and a half, I began slipping. Not in the sense of relapsing but small and not-so-small cracks in my program. When I first got out of rehab, I took the ""rigorous honesty"" aspect of the program to heart. I refrained from saying anything that can remotely be considered a lie and in the odd times I caught myself saying something that wasn't true, I possessed the integrity to admit it. Nowadays, my dishonesty has become much more predominant in my life. Here's a list of things I've recently lied about:

-Told my sponsor I had stomach problems to avoid going to my home group meeting
-Lied to my sponsor about making a certain amount of calls to other people in the program
-When asked how many girls I've been with by my gf, I lied by stating a significantly higher number to seem more experienced and fit the cocky/charming persona I've adopted around her
-When telling people stories, I'd recite something relevant I read off Reddit but pawn it off it as personal experiences
-I'd lie about how much time I spent playing video games 
-Lied to my parents about my recent exam scores, saying I got 2 As and a C when in fact I got 2 Cs and an A. 

There's plenty more that loom below the surface at the moment but that should suffice. Just pondering some of these lead me to believe I have the same tendencies of a pathological liar but majority of these lies are made out of fear. Fear of repercussions, fear of judgement, fear of losing something that I value. 

Over the past month and a half, I've been a horrible student. During many of the lectures, I'd be on my phone, hardly paying any attention. I'd take excessively long smoke breaks and miss out on a huge portion of the class and sometimes just blatantly leave the room. I procrastinate the fuck out of doing my work and most of my assignments were embarked on last minute. I'd hang out with my girlfriend up until 4 am, knowing I had a class at 8:30. 

This brings me to the next topic, which is my recently acquired need for female attention. Since arriving to Singapore, I've gradually developed a proclivity to pursue an abundance of romantic interest in my life. In the first week I've arrived to Singapore, I hooked up with a girl from my class. I became slightly attached to her but because our intentions didn't align, we went our separate ways although the craving for affection persisted. This unsatisfied yearning drove me to download tinder and since then, I've become involved with 3 girls', one of whom I'm currently dating. I see her on a daily basis and it's not as sex fueled as one might think. Her parents are home most of the time which makes sex a pretty uncommon occurrence. I'm reluctant to say it's lust that drives me to do this but it definitely does play a role in it. I speculate that it's the need for affirmation that fuels this behavior, to derive some sense of worth from the affection these girls provide me with. Shows to say just how low my self esteem is to this day. 

I'm not particularly sure where this is going to be honest. What I'm trying to say is that although my life seems to be on track and is a hell of a lot better compared to what it was like a year prior, I still feel restless, irritable and discontent when left with my own thoughts. Each day, I try my hardest to keep myself occupied. Reading Reddit, listening to music, playing video games, working out, playing sports whatever it is that keeps my mind busy. But once I stop for a minute and just think, I feel that sense of desolation looming within me. That sense of gloom and distress constantly gnawing at me. I try to keep it at bay but it never fully goes away. I still feel so directionless. My life still lacks purpose. Although I go to 4 meetings a week, chair one of them, work as a secretary for another, keep in contact with multiple people in recovery everyday, and am currently in the process of obtaining my degree, I still have no clue where I'm headed in life. Just like during my using days, I still live life on a day to day basis. Nothing planned ahead, no ideas concerning where I'm going, what career path I'm planning to choose, what I'll do once my course ends, nothing at all. I can't even think of what I'll be doing a year from now. All I can hope for is that I'm sober because I've had enough of that life already. I turn 18 in the following month and I still can't fully comprehend what it's going to be like being an adult. I just feel so lost at the moment and I don't know how else to express this. I really have no clue where I was going with this rant but I felt like I had to write it out and articulate the negative emotions I've been repressing for a while now. Thanks to whoever read this.

"I'm approaching two years sober and it's blowing my mind.
This might be a lengthy post so bear with me. I was incredibly young when I got addicted, I made a post 11 months ago titled 'nearly one year sober' and it just hit me that I'm approaching two years without speed. I look back at the night that I quit for the first time and how awful I was. I had lost 50 pounds in three months, I drank rockstars and monsters like water, and did so many things that I am utterly ashamed of: lying to friends and family, stealing, amongst other things. Being sober forces you to think about those things and that's one the biggest challenges I've had thus far. 

Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I think about it and it just eats me up inside, but the pride and contentment I feel now that I am able to see I am no longer that person and creating that separation in my mind is what inspires me every day to not make that call or buy that pipe. My addiction was a secret, so I handled 90% of my recovery on here and with the one friend I trusted telling everything to. I'm close to shedding a tear thinking about the changes I've made my life, even before my addiction I never thought I'd be alive this long. 

I woke up a few days ago and felt a craving I haven't in a long time after having a bad night, and I was so close to calling someone and picking up. I was shaking it was so bad, but I didn't. And as I was scrolling through my old posts I realized how close I am to two years and it made me so happy to not have made that call. You guys have been such an amazing support group for me, and I am beyond grateful to have such a wonderful community to talk to when things get rough.  I can only hope I've been there for someone else like you guys have been there for me. 

I don't want to make this post to seem braggy, but rather as a reminder that even if you're five minutes sober, that's your first step. It's going to fucking suck. You're going to feel awful, and depressed. But it ends, it ends. It gets easier. I never thought I'd escape it, but I swear to you guys it's possible. 

I'm not done recovering, I probably never will be. But the acceptance that each day I live is one day further away from my addiction is something that I treasure. I guess I just want to say thank you, for everything. If you ever need someone to talk you, never hesitate to message me. 

TL;DR I'm almost two years sober and so grateful for the support I've received on Reddit. Thank you. "
"100 Days
100 days. 100 fucking days sober from cocaine. I never thought I ever make it this far but I made it. It’s been a real fucking rollercoaster, I’ve had a lot of bad days, in fact most of that time I was miserable but I kept going - but it’s starting to get better; the cravings are subsiding and my mindset has begun to change - whenever I’m feeling shit I’ve noticed my first response is not to go to drugs anymore.

I still have a long way to go but in this time sober I have made incredible changes to the point I am almost a different person than the one I was before, I’ve been going to the gym consistently 6 times a week with a very clean diet and I really enjoy making gains haha - it’s the one thing I love doing now and that keeps me going. Im still learning how to enjoy life in other aspects - I have begun socialising a little more, just having 5 minute conversations with people. I used to use cocaine a lot to socialise so this has been a challenge for me but I’m getting there - I don’t feel ready to go out partying in clubs or anything sober without the risk of using yet.

Yeah just wanted to share my progress and if anyone out there is doubting themselves, if I can do it, so can you.

Here’s to another fucking 100 days!"

"I am new here and want to say hello!
Goodmorning fellow recovery folk. I have been reading this Reddit for a few days now and wanted to introduce myself. 

My name is Sam and I am 5 months and 8 days clean and sober. I am a recovering heroin addict, but have battled with almost everything under the sun. One thing I feel that lacks in my recovery is a solid support group. I turned to the internet this last week and found this forum. It is amazing to see so many people online supporting each other during recovery. I look forward to being an active member of this community.

Many thanks, sincerely,
Sam."
"Accidentally took a sip or alcohol at a wedding, does this restart my clean date?

hi! coming up on 70 days sober from xanax, adderall, weed, alcohol and cigarettes (lol). i'm a 22 y/o female and have not been sober for more than a day here and there since I was 12. from 12-20 I had a crippling adderall addiction and after it was taken away from me, I went into a crippling benzo addiction, decided to quit cold turkey because it was ruining everything (mostly my bank account and career) idk....just wanted somewhere to talk about this, thanks for listening y'all."
"My cousin died last night.
I'll preface this with: I'm not much of a typist, but I used my phone so it would autocorrect. Tommy had autocapitalize and autocorrect off and I can't bare to look at his phone anymore.

Some of you might have known him. /u/number3boys (now deleted) was my cousin. He was a cocaine addict for 20 years, a survivor of sexual assault as the hands of my father, his father and mother, his sisters, and later on, patients and staff in the psychiatric ward he lived in. He was frequent on here, /r/cocaine, and some other places I shouldn't mention.

Tommy was 37. Tomorrow he would have been 38. He snorted a fatal amount of cocaine mixed with heroin and fentanyl, which is unusual as he only ever snorted cocaine. I told his young daughters and half sister this morning.

Tommy was more like my brother. He was my best friend. He was a child at heart and the sweetest guy you could imagine. He was severely bipolar and didn't work, so I supported him after his mother died. I love him. He was just so sweet, like a little kid. He loved everyone.

He wrote in his diary about some very important people. Among the people he wanted to thank, and meet some day(!) there were two he wrote about most often.

/u/jbgreen - he describes you as awesome, snarky and someone who knew cocaine like he did. He says that he would love to ""do some rails with this guy"". The highest compliment from my cousin you can get.

/u/emoamy271 - we talked. He loved you very much and found your stuffed animals adorable. He had much to say about how you were always there for him and he appreciated that so much. Tommy loves you so much!

I wanted to let his friends (whichever he didn't include in his book) know where he was if he didn't come around anymore . Thank you for helping him through his bests and worsts. Sorry to damper the day."
"I passed my exam!
I am absolutely over the moon excited about it, and I just have to tell somebody! 

For context: I went to 5+ years of school for this area of study, but was so beaten down from an abusive boyfriend, PTSD, and a demanding professor, I didn't take it. I kept putting it off, and putting it off. I used drugs instead... And it was easy.

Then I got sober... And realized that a lot of things needed to change. I scheduled this exam roughly 4 weeks into sobriety, and was incredibly doubtful I'd still be sober when that date rolled around... Even more so about passing on the first try.

So... I'm just so happy that I wanted to share it with you.

"3 years since my last drink, little over a year since last fentanyl use, and first time completely sober
First stint in rehab was 2008, and it’s been pretty hit and miss since then. I had three years through AA but was still on Ativan and some occasional drug use. About 18 months ago I got squirmy and picked up pot as harm reduction (hadn’t smoked since 2001). Well it didn’t do what I wanted so in all my wisdom I jumped right to fentanyl. That worked, at first, then it became this god awful crutch that made me constantly sick, more overdoses than I can remember and horrible wd on a short ass half life.

My last OD was bad enough I was 5150 and two weeks in psych ward before heading to residential rehab for 2 months.

But it’s been a year, and I’m still clean....and happy. What a concept. I don’t do AA, instead I have a mix of SMART, lifering, trauma therapist, eating disorder therapist and dbt class. If you’re like me, drinking/UAing was hell but thinking my only other option being AA was not much better...I hope you know you do have a choice. Make your recovery your own, and make it sustainable.

This sub, stopdrinking, edrecovery and several others were and still are part of my program and provide real, tangible support. Thank you, to everyone here at every step of the process. "

"I'm 5 years clean and want to help
I've never done anything like this. My name is Mike and I'm an addict. Aside from addiction I also have major depression and moderate anxiety. I don't like recording myself or putting myself out there when I don't have to but I've made a video because I needed to say what I wanted to write to a lot of people on here. I thought about it and it took me a week to finally talk myself into making a short video. I'm an introvert to the fullest, I like to read and play video games, go on reddit, never comment, all that lame shit. Not start youtube channels. So this is a bit left field for me.

Like the title says, I'm 5 years clean. My drug of choice was heroin. I'm 28 years old now. I live in Chicago. I went back to college 2 years ago. I just wanted to say that recovery is possible! I see a lot of strong people on this sub. It takes strength to put your pain and your fear out there for everyone to see and read. You are not the only one and more importantly you are not alone! 

I hope this doesn't get classified as spam. I'm not a social marketer. I'm just an addict making a video response regarding recovery. However, I would like the channel to one day be a place you can visit when you have questions or comments whether it be for me or another member of the community concerning sobriety. I literally just started this thing today, so there's only one video (I plan to update daily), right now, it's more of an idea than anything but I have a vision maybe it can grow into something that can help other people who are suffering from substance abuse, give people like us a place online where we can get together, introverts unite! The path of recovery does not always have to be traveled alone, though it may feel like that the majority of the time. Reaching out is everything. This is me reaching out, I guess.

"We are a Vision of Hope - 8 Years!!!
Hi all,

I just wanted to share the joy that I have today. 

8 years ago today, I tried to kill myself by taking my dad's heart medication. I had gotten a DUI and I couldn't get clean. I believed that my life was just going to be more pain and misery, so I figured why would I put myself through that. I was 20 years old, but I felt like I was an old man. I ended up being found by my parents and ran away. I was throwing up black blood. I somehow survived and ended up going to rehab. There I was introduced to Narcotics Anonymous. I didn't have a basic text, so I stole it from the facility. 

My life has changed an immense amount in 8 years. I lived in a recovery house for 2 years, I moved out of there, I went back to school, finished school, reunited with my family, and am in the healthiest relationship I've ever been in. The biggest difference is how I feel about myself. I can laugh, forgive, and even love myself today. I attribute this directly from continuing to work steps, be of service, sponsor others, and apply spiritual principles to my daily life. Any addict, even a 20 year old agnostic, can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live.

One of the most amazing experiences comes from this subreddit. I saw one of the many postings on here of someone struggling and reaching out for help. I ended up messaging that person. Turns out, his old sponsor was one of my best friends. I just saw him the other week at a meeting and he looked happy, joyous, and free. This subreddit is an amazing opportunity to help reach those people who might be too nervous to hit a meeting yet. I try to stay away from definitions about my higher power, but I know my higher power puts me in places where I can see beauty, growth, and compassion. 

Thank you, Narcotics Anonymous, for giving me a life worth living."

**TL:DR alcohol will fuck you up, and you won't realize it until its too late.**






I like most of us if were honest started with my 1st drink when I was 4. 1979. It was a Coors that my dad had me taste with his buddies. It was mostly foam, I still remember the taste vividly. My second drink was when I was 13. New Years eve of '88. It was a glass airline bottle of Old Crow. Me and my friends took it off my folks nick-nak shelf. I remember everything about it. I remember the metal ring around the glass from the removing of the cap, I remember my lips feeling the grooves of the threading on the glass, and I remember it tasted like, wet dust. But something happened after that initial belt from the shock of the taste. I felt a glow in my gut. everything became ""ok"". I remember thinking...I'm gonna remember this moment for the rest of my life! Me and my 3 friends, walking in the dusk toward the next romp. I remember the stars twinkled brighter, the streets asphalt was cleaner and the green of the grass penetrating deeper into my eyes than before. Everything was interesting in a good way. I of course being the cool guy at 13 I was...I kept these thoughts to myself.

The next time I drank was about 2 months later, in the dead of winter, we had broken into a neighbors house and raided her liquor cabinet. this was a small country town, and no one locked their doors back then, we caused no harm, just a couple of kids looking for a kick. We got a mason jar and mixed rum, vodka, brandy and wine all together. We got black out drunk. it was near my 14th birthday. so I have been a black out drunk since I was 14. Needless to say we were horribly hungover. and I never touched alcohol again with the goal of getting drunk till my 21st birthday.

It was 1995 in southeastern Michigan, and for the next 15 years I would get by with my youth, environment or friends as an excuse for why I couldn't stop drinking. I was in college I was supposed to drink! Most of you can already guess where this is going, I stopped maturing, Had several great ladies who truly loved me and couldn't understand my behavior, countless relapses, unpaid bills deep remorse and occasional nights in jail. 

It wasn't until I woke up in a jail cell and the judge had told me my charges, I was looking at 20 years. No criminal record, just a DUI in 98. I didn't get into trouble when I drank, but every time I was in trouble, booze was involved. But what I was facing was a million-fold past even my worst nightmare. I beat the case, and by beat the case, I only went to jail for 10 months, and not for 20 years. When I was in jail there were to many to count who had caused unbelievable tragedy from their boozing. All were sent to prison for multiples of years, some ten or more, and I had to witness there grief and fear and sorrow every step of the way.

But there was one man, he got 22 years. He had a 6 pack, floored it though a yellow light, and killed a mother while her two small children survived. He was my cellmate, and I'd pretend to be sleeping when he wept late at night, or awoke screaming from a nightmare of seeing the children's faces. He took a plea deal of 22 years, if he had lost trial, he would have got 45 years. 

305 days of terrible tragedy after terrible tragedy, or worse yet, seeing those who didn't take there situation seriously, nearly guaranteeing a lengthy prison sentence in their future. I could never wake up, or at least go somewhere to avoid these cases of misery. Daily I was reminded of how lucky I was, how terrible it could have been for me, and how our egos blind us to reality.

Some reading this may think ""there is no way that would happen to me"". Well, I thought so too, just keep drinking and time will eventually get you.

Thats all I've got. Thanks for making it to the end.

"Finally Going To Rehab After 18 Years
Hey as the title says I am finally going to rehab. This is a 12 week total abstinence program. I live in the UK so unlike a lot of the American stories I have been reading. I will be getting this help for free, and should probably have taken it a long time ago.

I'm now 33, I smoked weed from the age of 13, then at 14/15 tried my first valium tablet, which made me feel on top of the world. Then by the time it was my 16th birthday I was taking ecstacy/cocaine then Heroin quite regularly.

I suppose it became a real problem when I was 17/18 when I dropped the uppers completely and was taking heroin every  day. Since then I have always tried to convince myself that  I was strong enough to sort this out myself by going on several different prescriptions. Methadone/Diffs and the most recent one Suboxone, which I have been on for the last 5 years. 

However the last 3 years I have been hitting crack/heroin a lot and finally decided it is time to sort this out once and for all, I haven't used anything apart from my Suboxone prescription for the last 2 weeks and I am starting to feel like myself slightly again. I will be going to a detox facility for 2 weeks in around a month to get of the suboxone, then switched right over in to the 12 week abstinence program at their facility.

I think I was scared to tell let everyone know I'd fucked up once again, and used the excuse of my childs mother (whom I don't live with) finding out. However I have now told everyone and to my surprise they have all been very supportive and are glad that I am doing this.

I suppose I am writing this just to hear from others who have went through something similar? I think the questions that are banging my head the most are, how did you feel on the day you were released from rehab? Did you feel like you fitted right back in with society or was this more a gradual thing after rehab?

Also sleep, thats a big one. How long did it take you to get a decent, or even semi decent nights sleep after being clean. Having been a functioning addict who has always held down a job. I am re located out of my town once I leave the facility, and although there is 2 years after care offered, I plan on getting a job and getting right back to work. I need to keep my mind busy."

I had been strung out on pills for a full year, the capstone to 20 years of near daily pot and alcohol use; with weekend hard drug benders regularly scheduled. I went to take a nap, so I could stay up later, and when I woke up, my living room was full of people. My first thought was “I didn’t buy enough e for all these people!” My second thought was “oh shit, this is my intervention!” I literally fell on the ground laughing,  because I didn’t have a problem! I was just sick, and I needed my Xanax and Ativan to just function and I needed my coke to stay awake. Eventually I agreed to go to rehab. The first three days were a nightmare, like something from a Clive Barker book or that old movie Jacob’s Ladder. Around day 4, I had a moment of clarity and accepted that I was powerless of drugs and  the obsession to use was lifted, and it never returned. I went to a meeting every day for a year, then I went 5 times a week for the next two. I don’t go to a lot of meetings these days, but I keep in touch, and when life gets me down I know where to go.

If it worked for me, it can work for you."
"Does the shame of a relapse ever go away? Will I ever feel successful with my clean time again?
I had 3 years and 8 months clean and decided to use for one day. I came back in the rooms the next day and was able to get almost a year clean before I decided to use for another day. I just got back from a convention where I didn't stand up during the clean time count down because there is so much shame that I only have 100-something days instead of the five years I ""should"" have.  Picking up key tags has been terribly painful and a shaming experience. I just want it to feel successful to get a key tag like it felt when I first got clean. I want the hugs I get when I get a key tag to feel like an ""I'm proud of you"" hug instead of like a ""pity"" hug. 

After my first relapse I never felt the shame go away, so I don't think I can expect it to this time either. Even if I ever get a four year medallion, more consecutive clean time than I've ever had, I feel like I'll still have in the back of my head ""I 'should' have almost 9 years right now""

I just wanted to know if it ever went away for others who have relapsed, or is there anything practical I can do to fix my distorted perspective"
"On March 25th it will be 3 years of sobriety for my wife. Need celebration ideas
Long story short My wife quit drinking for good reasons 3 years ago March 25th. She said she wants to go to a meeting to get her chip. I am so incredibly proud of her for her staying strong, especially since she and I both had some dark times and I know first hand how it can feel to want but not have a drink. She doesn’t have many friends and unfortunately these days when you invite people to celebrate anything without booze many don’t even give an excuse they just don’t show up.

"If you're struggling, don't let pride, fear and ego stop you from getting help.
My name is Nicholas Labar and I'm just over 4 years sober from all mood or mind altering substances. My thing was heroin. Really loved that shit and the way it made me feel. But in turn it ruined my life and every single relationship I've had, personal or casual. After overdosing and almost losing my life that still was not enough. Best friend dies and that's still not enough. My bottom came when I had realized my life was passing me by and I had nothing to show for it. December 30th 2013 I decided I was going to give this recovery thing a shot. At the very least If I did not like It i could always go and get High again.. but here I am. 4 years later. Living a life worth living. My son was born on December 30th 2014.. on my 1 year anniversary. I've had some very dark times in sobriety.. but I've also had some amazing times. Life's full of peaks and valleys.. but it's how you deal with those peaks and valleys is what defines you. There is hope. Call (866) 276-1818 if you're struggling. You matter, and don't let your disease tell you otherwise. "
"I managed to not binge last night
Is it ok to post food-related stuff here? Binge eating is my main problem when it comes to compulsive behaviours. I also have a problem with binge drinking, but it's so much easier to not drink than to not overeat. Five weeks sober. I've tried the Overeaters Anonymous subreddit, but have had some unhelpfully dogmatic responses.

Anyway, one of my triggers is being tired (even if I'm in bed), and I managed to get through yesterday without binge eating. I listened to an OA podcast, and argued with my addictive voice successfully. I go to meetings including one SMART Recovery meeting, have had a lot of therapy for my personality disorder. Still struggle to cope.

Edited to add: I'm about 80 pounds overweight, it's a serious issue."

"Heading to rehab
Hey guys, 

I had my first overdose two days ago. I'm a few hours I'll be transferring to a rehab facility. Please keep me in your thoughts."
"Still battling heroin after 8 years sobriety.
I've never done anything like this. I'm terrified to do so, but I need to and I hope someone can get something from my experiences, so here goes:

I'm a 30 year old from the Midwest. I am a husband to a beautiful wife and father of two beautiful girls. I am halfway though a PhD in theoretical physics. I live a stable life with much love in my. When I write all this down, everything seems very well. But lately, the demons have returned full force.

My addiction story starts 10 years ago where I was in college. I was very bored and depressed. And like many 20 year olds, I enjoyed drinking heavily and getting stoned. It was all good. But the party life began to get dull after a few years and began to experience a desire for more to calm my anxious mind. I don't honestly remember how it happened, but 30 mg of oxycontin fell into my hand and it was exactly what I needed to soothe my mind. Soon, more found it's way to me. So the more I did. Soon I realized it was happening most days and it had an effect on my day-to-day life. My roommate at the time was prescribed Adderall, and he hated it. So he gave it to me. I was strung out for a long time and it didn't seem to worry me.

This went on for quite some time. Fast forward to when I was 22. I was running into some minor financial issues due to trying to pay for this expensive addiction. At that point, I didn't see this as a big enough problem to quit my habit, so I learned of a friend of a friend who had some heroin. Then I learned that it was very cheap comparatively. So naturally, my addict mind decided that was a good idea. So then I began the dark path down that road. 

After a few months of this, my life really started feeling like it was falling apart. I no longer cared about anything except my addiction. I woke up on the floor of my basement after a night of particular heavy use. I cried and cried for a long time, because that's what it took for me to realize what my life had become. I decided what I needed to do was pack my things and move back home to get clean. So I spoke with my parents, spoke with my roommates. My parents gave me the money to pay my share for the remaining three months of our lease and I moved back. I withdrew in the care of my accepting parents. I began my life again.

So I stayed clean. I got a job. When I was comfortable, I got my own apartment again. Lived life as a relatively functional adult. I met who would become my wife. We fell in love. We had an accidental child who we love. She convinced me to go back to school and get my degree. So I did that. Then I realized I wanted a PhD, so I was accepted into grad school.

Throughout all those good things, every so often, the demons would come back out and tell me it wouldn't be bad to just try heroin again. I always resisted, if not for me, but for my wife and kids. My wife knows the whole story and is very supportive. Thank god.

For the last two months, I have had these desires like I've never had before. Granted a PhD in physics can be very stressful, especially with two kids. I find I think about heroin a lot. And about how good it felt. And how little cares and anxiety I actually had. Last night and today were the worst. My wife was at work and I was at home with the kids. All I wanted was to find some and forget about everything. Thankfully, I resisted. I hadn't been telling my wife about these feelings because I didn't want her to worry more. I spoke with her and as always, she was supportive and there for me. 

I absolutely do not want to go back to my old lifestyle. I don't think I would survive. I have so much going on. I know I will carry these addiction demons with me for the rest of my life, but the best I can do is tell them to go back to Hell. I am lucky that I am where I am. 

There's my story. I hope someone can relate and maybe can just be ok knowing that we are not alone. Even after 8 years sobriety, I still struggle and I will continue to do so. So let's all support each other!"
"I did it! Off Valium/Suboxone after 3 month taper
Really pleased to have the support of people in NA as I'd never have gotten this far without relapse

"my first meeting
ive posted here a few times when i was struggling. i did use many times in betweent hose posts and tried quitting again.

every time i post i get the same responses which is get my fucking ass to a meeting and i always ignored them. i did other things like go to a therapist or scare the shit out of my family with how i was feeling.
my last post aside from the people telling me to get off my ass and go i also got a private from someone who sounded like me and just told me how much it really does help. i finally decided to take what everyone was telling me seriously and made it to my first meeting last night.

i think it was the best choice i made, yes i was nervous during before and after but the people were great. they way they treated me as a newcomer was amazing and i honestly felt loved, i heard few people tell stories and one guy sounded exactly like me and it almost made me cry.
but first off. thank you to everyone who kept saying go to a meeting. it was the best thing i think i could have done and i plan on continuing to go a few times a week. not only for me but for the people there as well. i mean i liked who i met and they cared how i was. i think i did make the right choice in going."
"Here to help. 22f, 3.5 years clean/sober.
I got ""forced"" by my loving parents into rehab at the fresh age of 19. I was having the time of my life: I was in my dream college, active in my sorority, and oh yeah- absolutely dead inside. 

But thanks to them- I am alive today and I am so much happier. Giving up my location (moving/withdrawing from college temporarily), friends (I had to cut ties with friends who I only would use with), and anything else that was only associated with my addiction was the hardest thing I could have ever done and such a huge sacrifice, but the GIFTS sobriety and recovery have given me have been worth it. I went from going to a good college to going to one of the top 5 business colleges and then securing a job with one of the top three worldwide tech companies. And that's just career! In personal life I found my soulmate and have two puppies.

LIFE IS SO GOOD SOBER. The promises come true with time.

But the reason for this post is not to tell my story, although I felt necessary to establish myself before offering a listening ear or maybe any advice. Staying clean young is hard (staying clean at all is hard!! But add on a 21st birthday and all your friends binge drinking? It's tough.) - I can tell you what I've done and possibly help.

YOU CAN DO THIS.

I got clean young and I have 3+ years in recovery. I want to help any way I can - offering advice/telling what I did, listen, etc. I also was raised in alcoholic household, so I can help with that too! "
"Kratom is just as bad as opiates. Don't let your mind fool you.
Long story short I have been an addict for a while. I was using opiates and my fiance found out which led to huge issues in our relationship. We got through it after a lot of hard conversations.

I didn't want to get on suboxone so I started taking Kratom to ease the withdrawls. I'm sure you can all see where this is going; I just traded one addiction for another.

I kept taking Kratom even though I told her I stopped. She found out last night and now I don't think I am engaged anymore. She smashed her engagement ring with a hammer...

I've lost the most important thing in my life. I feel like a shell of who I was before. 

I've been sober for about 26 hours. I'm at work and I cannot focus, cannot think about anything except how many times I have ruined my life. It took me a long time but I've bounced back from all of it... except for this. I dont think there is any coming back from this.

I just keep hearing what she said to me last night again and again. ""I fucking hate you. You don't love me. You're a worthless piece of shit."" I'm not sure what makes me more sad; the fact that those things are coming out of her mouth or the fact that I agree with her.

I hate myself. I destroy everyone's lives. I wish I was dead."
"750 days, today...
Don't leave before the miracle happens. I'm a 23 year old recovering drug addict, but I've lived free of opiates, benzodiazepines and alcohol for 750 beautiful days... This freedom is something I could never have fathomed from my spot on the rocks in active addiction.

For me, acceptance was the answer. I had to give up the hope of a better past before I could bear living in the day - now there's no place I'd rather be. 

Keep on keepin on, friends."
"Not your typical addiction.
I'm not sure if this is the place to post this because isn't your typical addiction, but I have been recovering from self harm. I've been ""clean"" for a month and eight days (ever since I started dating my boyfriend) and I feel...alright.
The urges are strong, and they come fast and hard, but I've been trying, with my boyfriend's help, to get through them. I've been doing well so far and I'm proud of myself for the first time in all my 22 years of life."
"Just out of rehab. Nervous about first meeting. Please help.

"Today's my anniversary :)
I'm quite proud of myself and my recovery. I've been clean for more years than I used, i am trustworthy, I am healthy and I am safe.

I still have triggers and still act out with food or procrastinate at times but I'm not stealing to get a fix or hurting others. I'm not killing myself.

"14 Years Ago, on this very day.
I woke up destroyed.
The day after my birthday, several hours from the night before gone from my memory like they didn't exist.

14 years ago, on this very day.
I realized I was beat.  I realized I was playing a game with my life on the line that was rigged.  With the rules as they were that day, I would never 'win', only lose, again and again.

14 years ago, on this very day.
I asked for real help.
Not the kind of help that we ask for in times of distress of our own creation 'Get me out of this and I will do better' but real help.  

14 years ago, on this very day.
I started a new life.  
One that has exceeded any expectation I had that day (I still work on setting expectations, even today, but it is progress, not perfection).  Every day has not been a walk in the roses.  The last 14 years, lived in increments of 24 hours, there have been many challenges.  That said, with a lot of help and support, I have gotten through all of them.  Not just gotten through these challenges, but have tried to do it in a healthy way.

I have personally heard from many folks that have gone back out after double digit recovery that they have had too many years and not enough days.  Even though today, I celebrate 14 years, I still am grateful every morning when I get up that I am sober.  I still remember that fateful day when I woke up and surrendered.  I still know that no matter what job I have, how many people love me in my life or how much money is in my account that even after 14 years I am still vulnerable to my Scumbag Alcoholic/Addict brain.

14 years ago, on this very day.
I was able to reboot my life. 
I cannot take any credit for this, if it were completely up to me, I would have mucked it up. The friends/sponsors/sponsees/family that I have relied on over this time deserve the credit.  The HP of my understanding deserves the credit.  I am a happy passenger, filled with gratitude, trusting that life will work out just the way it is supposed to.

If things are bad, they will get better.  If things are awesome, they will probably not stay awesome forever.  No matter what though, things will work out just the way they are supposed to, only if I don't get in the way and try to make them do one thing or another."
"Our disease is still alive !
For all of you out there who wonder ' am I still under attack from my disease  ? I've got xx amount of time maybe I can take a drink.  ' or whatever it is that we think ( yes WE ALL think this  members with doubles digit years do as well they have told me ). This shit is still out there. 

My sponsors brother committed suicide two nights ago. He was drunk coupled with depression. He decided to take his own life. Maybe he thought there was no way out. Who knows what he was thinking. 

Just remember if you are new to recovery or shit if you have ten years and are feeling stuck.

 There is a way out. 

One day at a time. 

We never HAVE to use again. 

Please go to a meeting and tell someone how you are feeling.

"Reddit, today is the day I stop.
I am 24 years old. I have been a heavy drinker since around 17-18, I was your stereotypically high school metal head that never really grew out of party mode. Last night I blacked out again, enough is enough. I am going to my first open AA meeting tonight, my girlfriend is coming for moral support (her father was a bad alcoholic and due to his priors is not even allowed in the same state anymore).

I came to the realization that I am going to hurt myself (more/again) or someone else by my drinking, and I'm not taking emotional damage. I've driven drunk, when I drink I will do any drugs, I become this other person, I steal stuff, I degrade women, I generally become an asshole if you try to stop my ""fun"". I'm already feeling a little better admitting this to strangers, granted this is over the internet, but maybe this is like practicing a speech in a mirror before the event.

I'm looking for any advice anyone can give me to take under advisement. Tips to stay on the straight and narrow. I still live with my parents and they drink, so there is booze in the house. The thing that blows my mind is alcoholism runs on both sides of the family. My dad will have maybe 2-3 beers at night, if he even does that (he typically nurses a 30 pack all week, where as I would kill it in one night), and typically my mother doesn't even drink during the week.

Edit: So I went to the meeting, though I didn't participate much I felt better after leaving. Everyone was very friendly and open. My parents have said if I want they can lock up the alcohol in the house and curb their drinking around me, I told them for now no. I think maybe if I can resist it while it's directly in front of me it might be better. My girlfriend's mother also offered to let me live with them if it is too much being around it (She has a ""dry"" house). For now I declined, I appreciate what they are trying to do for me though. And I appreciate everyone's comments and advice. I did go over to r/stopdrinking like offtherocks suggested and requested a badge, who knows maybe it will help.

I was thinking of getting something to carry with me to remind me not to drink. I think after one year of AA you get a token? I was just going to get something small to carry in my pocket that every time I may want one to take it out and look at it to remind me ""No, you're better that, you can resist."""
"I lost my cousin today. Please take your recovery seriously, everyone.
I just got a call that my Aunt and Uncle found my 20 year old cousin dead today. He and his friend both overdosed last night. From what I can gather, they got the drugs from someone else and misjudged how much to use, or what exactly they had.

I grew up with this guy. We were extremely similar down to our sense of humor, the only major difference starting around age 13 when he started slipping into a different crowd. He fell into drug use, and eventually out of high school. I started to only see him at Christmas or Thanksgiving, and his parents did everything they could to try and help him. After some time, he started to improve his situation and worked for a couple of years at the family business downtown. But he was still casually doing drugs off and on, and last night it caught up with him.

I just wanted to post this here in order to try and encourage someone out there struggling with their own addiction. Keep in mind any momentary slip, no matter how casual, can be your last or the last for someone else nearby. As horrible as I feel, I can't imagine how destroyed my cousin's parents and sister feel. Even now, my mother is on the same road, and has been for about eight years, and I worry for her as well.

Good luck to those of you fighting similar battles."

"Found a sponsor and about to truly start my journey
I have only been to 10 meeting so far but I've been inspired by every one of them and I feel ready to fully commit. I took some good advice and chose 5 meetings I will attend every week so I make connections with people rather than shopping around for the ""perfect"" group. I may even have decided on my home group. 

I'm trying to trust my gut rather than overthinking things (overthinking got me into this predicament). I also decided I shouldn't shop around for the ""perfect"" sponsor either and take an opportunity if one arises. 

I was nervous about approaching people, but after I shared at a meeting last night (which I did even though I didn't feel like it) not only did people say they related to what I shared (even though I didn't feel like I had anything inspiring to say after hearing people share who have been sober 20+ years), but a woman approached me afterwards to ask if I wanted a sponsor. She has a lot of experience and seems very knowledgeable. I thought about it overnight and decided to go for it. I had a feeling that an opportunity would arise and if so I should take it. 

In only 10 meetings I've found the most amazing support group, I feel like I'm helping people even if my shares don't seem to me to be all that meaningful. I've also started to conquer my fear of public speaking. Just getting up in front of people and talking about such personal thing is a huge step. 

Who knows how much will change once I've gone to 100 or more meetings. For the first time in a very long time I feel hopeful, I feel like I belong, and I feel accepted. 

If anyone has any tips about starting out with a sponsor / starting the steps I'd love to hear them. Or even just any personal experiences. I'm starting out with calling my sponsor every day at the same time. 

Has anyone done 90 meetings in 90 days? I think it could be beneficial but I'm worried that if I aim too high I will feel like a failure if I don't manage it."

I have been seeing character defects and emotions come up that I wasn't even aware I had.

I took a year off (relapsed) went to college, did really well and had a blast, but ran out of money and developed a big pot problem again. Pot is my drug of choice. If I drink, I eventually start smoking weed again. and When I smoke weed, I do extremely stupid things like walk out of Fortune 500 companies and drop out of half-ride college scholarships and ruin relationships with people that I love, or could have the possibility to cultivate love with. Throughout all of this - my primary purpose was to figure out what my purpose was on this planet. I thought I had one. I always had this 'itch' after I had my first spiritual awakening (recognizing that ... there was a greater power than me in the universe) that I felt like I was chasing. I just couldn't stop chasing it. Don't know why, it just felt like I was doing myself a disservice by not chasing it. Hell - I was in my early twenties, why not?


So towards the end of this first year after stepping out of sobriety, I met a girl who looking back - was insane - but I was deep in my pot use and I thought she was perfect. Anyways she had a heroin problem, was sexually abused by her step-father and her mother would repeatedly deny it, and had frequent suicide attempts. Well she was trying to get sober and we would go to AA mtgs together and I believed it would be absolutely impossible for her to get sober from going to AA. I mean I knew she might be able to string together a few days and maybe weeks, but long term sobriety? I just didn't see it happening.


So I went to the library. I checked out all of the books on alcoholism and addiction that I could find. Buddhist recovery books, nutrition recovery, everything. I started reading. Then I finally got to this book called The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure.


After reading Chris Prentiss's son's story, and Chris Prentiss's explainations, my life changed. My life flashed before my eyes and I felt more powerful and more aware of who I was and I felt like I had finally found what I had been searching for... for literally forever. I dropped to my knees and cried my eyes out.


I felt like I knew what to do.


It took two years, dropping out of college (again) and slowly reducing my marijuana intake and changing how I approached life to get consistent sobriety. I don't smoke weed, drink, or do anything else - I do use a vape stick though, and I have been consistently cutting down on that (24mg starting to 12 mg currently, I use to smoke about a pack a day).


I started doing what I wanted to do, within the confines of my reality. My head was finally a safe space. I use to be very extroverted and out-going, and as of today I am more solitary and at peace. My social ability is returning, but I do not put emphasis on it like I use to.


Anyways that's how I got sober today. I do what I want today - within the confines of reality. Currently, I *slightly want to* but mostly have to work full time to pay off some debts I have accrued, and to feed myself and keep myself sheltered to a comfortable level. Sadly, this is a reality and necessity in my world. I am working to figure out how to reduce my work week - as free-time is something I strongly enjoy.


I am definitely timid in areas such as relationships and friendships, but I find so much peace being alone (something I never could do prior to reading the Alcoholism and Addiction Cure) that I am okay with that. I truly feel like I am making progress every day.


I attend AA mtgs regularly as I really do admire and identify with a lot of the Blue Book / Big Book ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" book literature. I don't hear much of the message in meetings and most meetings I go to I feel like are filled with people that need help, but what I do appreciate about the meetings is the authenticity and rawness of people communicating what they are experiencing in their lives. I also absolutely thrive on new-comers, hearing their story reminds me of how I use to think and how horrible it was being out there - and the sheer struggle of early sobriety. I still keep in contact with my former sponsor (who I consider to be a mentor, life-guide, teacher, and friend today) and with a few people I have developed friendships with over the years.


I would love to hear your feedback as I am being completely raw in my communication.


Thank you for reading this."
"It’s just scary how easy it is to pick up.
I’ve been sober for 124 days. 28 of which were in rehab, so I’m still super new at this.  I’m on a mini mothers day vacation with family right now.  Everyone has fallen asleep and I’ve snuck out to the terrace for a smoke.  Sitting next to me is a glass of wine my husband didn’t finish.  On the dresser is half a bottle.  I just dumped the glass.  The bottle will sit there.  I’m not going to touch it. 

I’m fine with people drinking around me.  I think it’s important to get there.  I don’t go to bars and avoid parties, but when out to dinner, if people want to drink it doesn’t bother me.  

But….
I wish he had corked it and put it away.  My cravings have been minimal to none, but saturday night, just a glass is sounding good. I have an almost itchy antsy feeling in my chest that is saying just do it.  No big thing.  At the same time I’m fast forwarding. . .  I know one glass won’t be enough and I’ll head to the bar.  There will be hangover, major disappointment and a reset to zero days for nothing.  Worst case no one will notice and I’ll be off and running drinking on the down low until I find myself back in rehab.  

I’ll go to bed soon without drinking.  I’m doing the minute by minute thing.  Sometimes it’s so easy and I don’t even think about drinking.  Tonight will just be another hurdle that will make the next time this happens easier.  

Thanks for listening and Happy mothers day to all you moms walking this same path. "
"How to stay in AA without it making you hate AA
So I've been around AA for a while.  8 years.  Over a thousand meetings.  Sober 95% of that time - topped out at about 3 years.

Turns out I just don't like the AA program.  There is some useful stuff in it, but most of it makes me cringe.  But I need to be around other recovering people and there is really no other viable forum to do so.  There are like 2 smart recovery meetings a month in some far off fuckburg.  So I'm stuck in AA and I'm kind of reconciled to that.  I just wish people would stop talking about AA in the AA meetings.  Its just the worst. "
"How sobriety has changed my life.
Hey everyone! Just want to share something with you all. A little less than 2 years ago I was locked up in a psych ward on a 7 day detox. My life was out of control - I couldn't stop drinking, using, stealing, lying and generally just being a waste of life. I had gotten kicked out of college and my apartment, had to move back in with my mother and my fiancé left me. I had my first dose of recovery in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous (this isn't the only way to get sober - it's just the way that worked for me). Since that day I have surrendered, worked the steps and become a completely different person. 

My fiancé and I got back together, I got back into graduate school, I got married to the love of my life, I got my Masters degree, I conceived a child, I moved to a new state, I started a Doctoral program and am currently sitting in the hospital awaiting the arrival of my first-born. 

You may notice that in the above paragraph I used the word ""I"" quite a bit (not purposefully). That's pretty funny because ""I"" didn't do any of this. I couldn't and I can't - I'm a low down addict and alcoholic. But surrounding myself with people in recovery, working to help another alcoholic/addict on a daily basis and working towards a spiritual connection (or at least not closing my mind to this idea) has given me everything I thought I had lost, and more. 

I just want to thank all those out there who continue to help the seemingly hopeless and also tell those who seem hopeless themselves, recovery is possible! "
"Finding a Pill on the Ground and Throwing it Away
Hi everyone, first time posting here. Anyways I am almost 2 years clean from opiod pills as well as heroin. Long story short was just walking through a park with my boyfriend and Saw a Baggie on the ground. Inside I saw 4 square pieces of yellow pill. Immediately I knew it as a 2mg Xanax (I've never even done benzos but I guess being a previous pillhead I taught myself a lot of knowledge). I looked it up to confirm because my boyfriend was curious and I was curious if I was correct in my guess. Turns out I was and immediately said that we need to throw this away to make sure no little kid finds it like I just did. Feels good to be clean:). "

I am 23 years old. My clean date is 5 November 2011: I've been clean for three years today! I've been homeless, jobless, single, and arrested (all clean!), but have still never found a reason to get high in three years. Now I am a valued employee with my own apartment and car. In the past year alone, I have gotten married and made the decision to continue my college education (I have straight A's). Life is good because I have done some work.

I am posting this not because I want any congratulations, but to say this: you never have to use again, no matter what, just for today."

"""any problems taking vicodin?""
That's what the dentist asked me yesterday after spending 90 minutes cutting/grinding/yanking my last wisdom tooth out.

I had already put in my paperwork that I'm an addict, and that I want to avoid narcotics. I had also mentioned to the dentist a couple times that I was fine with motrin. Still, she's just doing her job. I guess it's normal to offer vicodin to people that get things ripped out of their faces.

I'm glad I have benefited from listening to other addicts go through similar or worse experiences with taking narcotics. My mouth said no to the vicodin before my brain really had a chance to think about it.

I'm really glad I did that. The pain is honestly not that bad. I'm kinda surprised that anyone takes vicodin for this. Prescription-strength ibuprofen is doing the trick. There's still a dull ache, but that's nothing compared to the pain a relapse would bring."

"He deserved a proper obituary.
(Hope it's okay to post this here.  Never forget that people love you, even if they have had to step away from you.  Stay strong in your recovery.)

I spoke of you last night to a friend.  I hadn't in quite some time.  I mentioned, so very briefly, my experiences with you, simply as a benchmark of how strong I got throughout the years since knowing you - strong about setting up boundaries with others, no longer trying to heal the broken wings of the birds around me, remembering my needs over the needs of others.  And then I moved on in the conversation to another topic.  

This morning, over coffee, while sitting in front of my computer, the thought of you resurfaced and I wondered where you were. I googled your name.  I hadn't googled it in quite some time but still had the hope that one day if I googled it, I would see a facebook or linkedin profile that would put my hopes for you into reality.  But I didn't find any profiles or perhaps a family picture.  I found an obituary that simply showed your name, your city, your date of birth and your date of death.  I wasn't sure how I felt about it but I knew I had to go to work with a crazy hectic day where I wouldn't be alone for a minute so I pushed it aside.

I came home from work and started searching google again.  Your name was found on a memorial to the homeless who die in Toronto.  I then found your death itemized in someone's blog and I found it.  I knew but I had to see proof.  You died of a heroin overdose, didn't you?  Am I wrong?  I would love to be.  Honestly, I was surprised that you lived this long after losing everything so many years ago and ending up on the streets but we did always joke that you had more lives than a cat.   

My story with you ended when you moved to the streets, where we finally split ways.  Well, actually, it doesn't end there because for many months I drove by Queen and Sherbourne, knowing that you were living there, on the streets or in the shelters, doing any drug you could get your hands on but still attached to your first love, heroin.  And there was a certain part of me that thought if I didn't see you hanging out there, that maybe, just maybe, you had finally gotten clean.  Maybe.  And maybe you did.  For a while.   Maybe more than once.  So many years have passed.  Maybe.  

I called the same friend and told her what I had found online.  She asked for more detail and I offered it but it was all negative.  I recounted the most terrible moments of our relationship and living with your addiction while you spiralled downward so rapidly.  I hung up and I finally cried.  I cried for the lost potential, the sadness, the anger, the hatred for these drugs that not only destroy the lives of addicts but those around them, for your family, for your pets, for it all...

And then I remembered the good.  And while some would say that you used me during those years, I'll still remember the good as being sincere.  I have to.  I believe that something in you was good, but your addiction was too strong and this terrible, black illness took over your life and destroyed it.  

So with that being said, you deserve more than a blank obituary... and it deserves to be positive.  I give this last thing to you:

D. was adopted at an early age and loved so very dearly by his adoptive mother.  She recounted often how his energy and love of life kept her energized having raised him with a sister in Toronto.  D. did not excel at school, but excelled with people.  His ability to talk to anyone, make anyone feel comfortable and entertained surpassed most.  People gravitated towards him.  They enjoyed him.  They laughed with him.  And they knew that D. would give the shirt off his back for them often taking people in to live with him, giving to someone, even if it was just the benefit of the doubt.  

He started his career and success was all around him.  How could it not?  He loved the money and the fast life.  That world came so natural to him.  He had the perfect personality for it.  He made people feel welcomed.  He could sell ice to an eskimo.  And the eskimos loved the interaction!  

He loved animals.  He loved talking on the phone.  He loved his mother, his friends and his mentor.  He loved cars.  He loved food.  He loved his deep fryer.  He loved his ikea furniture in his apartment.  He loved his ergonomic laundry basket.  He loved his button down shirts.  His love was childlike and so innocent at times.  He made people around him love things too.

And on a more personal note: Thank you for the laughs D.  Thank you for breaking down my wall and opening a whole new world for me.  Thank you for showing me off, I always felt so special.  Thank you for teaching me how to drive and helping me buy my first car.  Thank you for allowing me to see the world through your eyes.  And most importantly, thank you for choosing my dog that day at the shelter.  I walked by him so many times but you spotted him and we have been a great match.

I learnt a lot from you D and I'm a better person for having known you.  Rest in peace.  Your demons are no longer.

Thank you to the workers and volunteers who help our homeless everyday.  You stand in when friends and family are unable to stand anymore.  You are the strong ones in this world and you do so much good.  Thank you for doing what I could no longer do."
"A powerful reminder
Yesterday was a long, frustrating day. I'm facing the biggest life change since I got clean 3 1/2 years ago and I'm stressed and anxious and completely wrapped up in my own problems. I really just wanted to get home and go to bed.

Fortunately that wasn't an option. I finally made an appointment to get my taxes done and I was due there at 7pm. I arrived 5 minutes early and had to wait almost 30 minutes for my tax preparer to be ready for me. I was just about to leave because I'm impatient and it's all about me. I am glad I didn't.

Towards the end of our session she asked me where I work. When I told her (halfway house) she started to tear up and tell me about her son. He's struggling the struggle that only we know. I could feel her fear and bewilderment when she told me a few specific stories. Over the next half hour I did my best to give her some hope. I told her some of my story, let her know that she isn't alone and recommended Al/Nar-Anon.

She told me that her son has lost friends to OD, one as recently as 3 weeks ago. I gave her my work and cell number and told her if her son ever wants to talk to someone who won't judge him he can call me any time. I then hugged this stranger and urged her not to lose faith. After all, I am not special and I'm doing it.

I then went to an AA meeting I haven't been to in a while. When I walked in I saw a face that disappeared from the rooms almost 2 years ago. I gave him a hug and asked how he was doing. He was back from a bad experience, and I got to let him know how happy I was to see him again. 

The speaker was the father of the child who OD'd 3 weeks ago as a direct result of this disease. The room was absolutely silent as he carried the message. It was a powerful meeting.


It all reminded me that my day to day problems are nothing compared to where I came from. It reminded me of why I *want* to be involved in AA and NA fellowships. It reminded me that no matter how bad I think my day is going, if I can manage to help one other person who is struggling with this disease then I am indeed a lucky man. Mostly though I am reminded that I need to call my Mom, because she went through her own personal hell as I went through mine.

TL;DR: I know hard times and this ain't it."

"Returning to work after rehab... again.
Just thought I would share my experience with y'all as I know this can be a huge source of stress for many just as it was for me.

Last night was my first night back at work after 5 weeks in rehab for the second time. Same job and many of the same people.

I am a dispatcher at UPS and see and talk to roughly 200 drivers nightly all of whom have noticed my absence and most of whom have known the reason for it.

For the last couple weeks the anxiety has been building about this and although I have no desire to use right now I can see how this could temp others.

I sat it the parking lot for 5 minutes before going in and asked God to help me through this and to help me answer all the questions I knew where coming.

I'm happy to report today that I was shown nothing but love from all those people who really care about me. 99% of the remarks where along the lines of ""good to have you back, glad you're doing well"".

If you're facing the same situation soon try to relax; I promise it won't be nearly as bad as your brain had made it out to be.

"Former AA member who’s been using for two years now. Tried listening to AA tapes, and it makes me cringe. Tried smart meetings but there’s no members in my area. What other options do I have?
Hello everyone. So I was in AA, and I worked the steps THOROUGHLY with one of the most respected AA’ers in my state. I eventually grew resentful with AA and after having gone through the steps n doing everything I was supposed to be doing and not feeling aaaaaanyyyyyyyyy better, I said fuck it n started using again.

Prior to AA I was trying to check out smart meetings too. I went to a couple in my area and there was no one there.

I’ve recently tried listening to AA tapes and to put it lightly, it was cringeworthy. The same recycled, redundant nonsense that you hear at every meeting.

Are there any options I don’t know about as far as recovery groups? I need help.

"Day 46 of Sobriety from Heroin
Hey folks! 

I just found this subreddit and I want to join in the fun. Today marks the longest I've gone without any psychoactive substance (except caffeine and nicotine patches) since I was 15. It's been a hell of a ride, and I'm only 23.

A bit of a backstory on me: I dabbled with Hydrocodone and Oxycodone in high school, like an idiot. But I didn't develop a serious chemical dependency until I was 19. I used obscene amounts of alprazolam for months (that part of my life is a black hole). Then after I weened off of my 30-40mg addiction to alprazolam; I started using Oxymorphone, Hydromorphone, and Oxycodone. 

At that point of my life (21 years old) I was still adamantly against needles. I started ordering fentanyl off of the darkweb in the fall of 2016. In the following few months I overdosed 4 times, I'm lucky to be alive. My now fiancè saved my life by performing CPR on me on two of those instances. Anyway, I ended up in an IOP program about a year ago now and I was on Suboxone for 6 months. 

After my stint in IOP, I stayed sober for two months. Then one night last September, I had a horrible craving and bought heroin for the first time in a good while. Within a month I was an IV user. I started falling behind on my bills so I could afford the $200+/day heroin addiction. I'm sure the story is familiar to some.

March 3rd, 2018 I talked to my parents and my fiancé's parents begging for help. We were both (as in my fiancè and I) on the verge of total financial collapse and subsequent  homelessness. She went to an inpatient rehab and as I had no insurance, I went cold turkey and sweated it out at my parent's house for 8 days.

So that was longer than I expected; but alas there it is. Currently my fiancè is living at a sober living apartment and I'm traveling the Carolinas for work all summer. Everything has been going really well! We're both attending NA meetings (I attend about 3-4 a week, I'm trying to increase that number.) 

Recently, I've been riding what's the so-called ""pink cloud"". As in I feel really good and I'm highly motivated in all facets of my life. I know I've got to be careful, because this is not the norm. Any advice in regards to the pink cloud would be fantastic! 

Well that's my story guys. I'll definitely be around on this subreddit a lot. Whoever would like to chat about recovery/life in general, I'll be here! Have a great day yall! 

Just for today, I'll stay sober.

"Stay sober--you are worth it
My best friend's little brother overdosed on Monday and went into cardiac arrest. After several days in a coma, they've determined he is brain dead and they will donate his organs tomorrow. 

He leaves behind a 4 month old son. He had been clean for several months now and was doing a great job as a dad. Now his son will never know him.

If you're wanting to relapse or are struggling, please talk to someone. You are worth it, and you are more than your addiction. I wish I'd told all these things to him, as well as how proud I was of him for all the hard work he had put in to try to beat his addiction. Every day will be hard, but keep fighting. Don't give up. You're worth it."
"To anyone who is turned off by the “higher power
I, initially was completely turned off by almost every sobriety/recovery group that had anything to do with a ‘higher power’z It seems like no matter how hard you search you will never find a sobriety group that doesn’t reference a higher power.

Well, something that took me forever to realize is that ‘higher power’ doesn’t HAVE to have religious connotations. I was raised in a completely ambiguous household. My parents had their own beliefs which to this day (I’m almost 21) I still don’t know exactly what they identify as. We never had to go to church, religion just had 0% of mine and my 3 older siblings upbringing. I myself classify myself as agnostic. I find afterlives and anything beyond what is proven as black magic but I am completely willing and open to people proving me wrong.

Now as far as recovery goes, when I first started trying to find groups they all just seemed like church groups but what I’ve found for myself is that they leave it open to interpretation. I’ve always considered the “higher power” in recovery to be the voice inside myself who really knows what’s best. My parents who only want what’s good for me. All the potential I had before I got into coke and opiates. “Higher power” doesn’t have to be a religious thing. It’s just anything in you or in your life that you want to live up to."

"Lucky to be alive and clean
I am a recovering drug addict and my life story is pretty crazy. It would take an entire book to go over everything I've been through mostly because of drugs, but here's a small glimpse. I've been used, abused, raped, and held hostage. I've done unspeakable things. I lost my best friend to suicide when I was 18 and many other friends to addiction over the years. I've had an eating disorder since I was young, and always suffered from anxiety and depression. I have had alcoholic pancreatitis 6 separate times, each time it got progressively worse and the last episode almost killed me. I've been told that if I drink again I will die. I started using opiates when I was 17 and eventually it led me to shooting heroin. on March 1st 2016, I thought I was sick with a severe flu or possibly just detoxing. I was throwing up, had diarrhea, fever of 105 and could barely walk. After a week of this I finally went to the ER. Good thing I did, because turns out I had actually developed a heart infection called endocarditis from IV heroin use. Like many my use started off socially and quickly turned into a daily battle. Heroin had my soul for a long time. I lost everything. Anyway, the doctors expected the infection to get better with antibiotics but my condition only got worse. My kidneys failed and I needed to have dialysis done every day. My body went into septic shock. After a few weeks they came to the conclusion that I needed open heart surgery, but feared that I wouldn't survive it because I was in such bad shape.  I had my tricuspid valve replaced with a pig valve. I lost so much blood during the surgery that they didn't think I would make it. They also had to give me enough pain killers and anesthesia to knock out an elephant because my opiate tolerance was so high.  I didn't wake up afterwards for two weeks. My family was afraid that I would never wake up. During this time, they had me on Ketamine and fentanyl to manage the pain. This caused me to have severe, disturbing hallucinations about past experiences that were very traumatizing to me. After I woke up I thought the hallucinations were real, and it took weeks for the doctors and nurses to convince me that nothing actually happened. After all this, they thought I was starting to recover. It's hard for me to remember much from this time because I was mostly sedated. My open heart surgery was surprisingly successful, though they described it as a ""salvage attempt"". But then my condition started to rapidly decline. I couldn't breathe without being hooked up to oxygen. Eventually they put in a trach (cut a hole in my throat so I could be hooked up to a machine that breathed for me). They would also stick a tube down my throat every 15 minutes to suck up the mucus to help clear my airway. I was hooked up to a feeding tube and had a catheter put in because I could not sit up or walk to go to the bathroom. I wasn't able to talk either..I felt so helpless. I felt like I was dying, the pain was indescribable. I was also having panic attacks because of everything that was happening which made it so much worse. They couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting better. My kidneys were still not functioning and I needed dialysis every day. Eventually they ran tests on my lungs, and found that I had a rare infection called Blastomycosis. My lungs were completely filled with mucus, which was why I wasn't able to breathe on my own. Normally this wouldn't be life-threatening, but since I was already basically dying it only added to the hell my body was going through.  To this day they haven't figured out how I got the infection. After this grim diagnosis, 3 doctors came into my hospital room and told me that I would probably not make it. Said to say goodbye to my family and everything. They asked me if I wanted to be made comfortable, go out peacefully so I didn't have to feel this torturous pain anymore. I told them absolutely not and that I was going to fight with everything in me. My parents were by my side every single day and night and without them I probably would have given up. It took a lot of mental and physical suffering but I survived. My lungs slowly improved and after a few months I could finally breathe on my own again. My kidney function also started improving and eventually dialysis was not needed anymore. After 3 1/2 months of lying in a hospital bed my muscles deconditioned severely. I had to learn to walk again and build up strength to function normally. Just being able to sit up on my own again felt like a victory. Putting my socks on without assistance was an accomplishment. After they took my trach out, I was able to talk and eat/drink again so they took my feeding tube out. It took about a month for my stomach to handle real food again, so I would usually throw up every time I ate something. I was 75 pounds when they released me from the hospital, and then I spent another 3 weeks in a rehabilitation center doing physical therapy. Just when I thought I could finally go home, I had to be hospitalized again because my calcium levels were dangerously high. I spent another 3 days there. It took a long time for me to gain my weight back and feel ""normal"" doing everyday activities. I lost all of my hair due to the medications I was on, from losing so much weight and also because of the trauma my body went through. I have scars on my chest, stomach and throat from the operations and procedures I had to go through. I have permanent nerve damage from losing so much blood and from some of the medications. My lung function is only at 60% because of so much scarring from the infection. Despite these physical and emotional issues caused from what I went through, I have gained so much. I am finally clean from heroin. This experience opened my eyes to what I was doing to myself and my family. I truly feel that everything happens for a reason, and this happened to me so that I could stop using drugs and change my life. Something I had been trying to do with no avail for so many years. I now have a healthy relationship with my parents and have nothing to hide from them. I am finally living a normal, successful life free from the grip of drugs and alcohol. My hair has grown back, I look healthy and feel better than I have in years. I am slowly regaining everything my addiction took from me. I now have faith that a higher power does exist, because there is no other way to explain how I could have survived something so extreme. This experience almost killed me but instead gave me my life back. I am forever grateful.  "
"Would you guys be interested in a podcast about careers in recovery?
Hey everyone,

I was driving to work this morning thinking about podcast. I've always wanted to start one, and I have been really successful in my career so far. I know there are a lot of other people in recovery who have as well.  and a lot of people that feel stuck working as a server or in a minimum wage soul sucking job.

In 12 step meetings its something that's not really talked about, and for good reason. Especially for the newcomer. I don't think people should just run out and get degrees right when they start out or get the impression that they should.

So I would like to start something for people that have a foundation and want to know what their options are, hear how people did it and stayed clean and sober, and to know that just because you have a record or feel behind doesn't mean that you can't change and find something fulfilling.

I feel like being in recovery, in terms of a career we have unique challenges that most people don't have to face. Especially because have ot take in out spiritual health way before personal development. It can be hard learning when to make the jump and start being productive members of society outside of the room.

Would anyone be interested in something like this? "
"4 months clean! It’s mind blowing!
I’ve posted here a few about my recovery from opioid and suboxone addiction. 12 year opioid addict, about half of that as a suboxone addict (with many relapses in between). This is the first time in 12 years I have been off pills, heroin or suboxone completely. So I just hit 4 months clean and sober a few days ago. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to who understands and I love this sub for that! 
So anyways it’s still going pretty good. Still a lot of issues with anxiety and insomnia. Some rls when I try to sleep still but I can usually fight through it. My energy levels are still pretty crappy but I do notice them very slowly getting a little better. Cravings have been very mild! For the most part. I had a dream the other night I found a suboxone strip in an old purse. So of course when I woke up the next day I dug through all my old bags hoping to find a piece. I didn’t thank god! If I would’ve I know I would’ve taken it, so that’s a little terrifying. That’s the first really bad craving I’ve had since I’ve been out of the active physical withdrawal. But anyways, like always I hope this may help some one else going through anything similar. Hang in there! It gets better and although I do complain and still don’t feel “normal”, life is so much brighter and more vibrant! And happier! "
"Loss of life
You can look through my profile and the few post I have are involving this. Well my sons mom, my ex fiance, died about 3 months ago from heroin. She was 30. I have always done what it take to keep my son safe. Always. But I want everyone on this page to know, someone loves you, a lot. I hated her for many years, what she did was terrible. But deep down I still care. A lot. Don't leave everyone on earth to pick up the pieces you leave behind. YOU start picking them up now. You got this! Pm me if you want to. I just don't want any other children to be told that their mom (or dad) has passed away because of drugs. Thank you"

"Going back to rehab tomorrow
The day I have been waiting for. This will be my 3rd time in a year. Something has to give. I am over this lifestyle. I am over the dirt bag people that come with it. I am over the shady manipulative things I am doing. Most of all I'm tired of losing. 

I have been living in a sober house since October. I transitioned to a THU from the same establishment I am going back to tomorrow. I was doing great when I first got out. I was going to meetings, fellowshipping with sober people and feeling like a productive member of society again. I knew my biggest trigger for relapse would be women so I tried my best to keep them at bay. But one girl I met at treatment was so much like me the thought of relapse with her seemed very likely and very desirable. I made it to my 60th day and I was so proud of myself. I had a meeting planned and was gonna go eat with family. Low and behold the girl I speak about says it's time to relapse. I knew what would follow suit with that, great sex and our relationship getting stronger so I was all for it. For the first month or two I was only snorting the meth. But then I stopped getting high. I am an IV user and if anyone knows what that is like there is no stopping that monster once it's been awoken. This whole time I am maintaining residency at the sober house still flying under the radar and getting by. I was seeing my daughter as much as possible, whom I had just met when I got out of rehab in October. She's only two so it's not to late to let her know who daddy is. My relationship with that chick was on the rocks and I got into it bad again. I was dropping weight like crazy and even beginning to smell strange. Strange enough to where people did not wanna be around me. At this time I had stopped meetings completely and my goal every morning was how am I gonna get high today. I didn't get back into robbing people or doing anything that dirty but I was resorting to people places and things I wouldn't normally associate or surround myself with. Last week my house hit me with a random drug test. Of course I failed and policy is I have to leave for three days and when I come back if I can piss clean I'm back in. Those three days I didn't use. I 5150'ed and even stayed in a homeless shelter. Needles to say I made it back in. Those three days were hell. Today at noon I got the call from my outpatient counselor saying my bed was ready. I have been estatic since. 11a.m tomorrow I get another chance at life and to things right. Send my your prayers and love please. And tips!

Things I'm going to do differently. 
Get a sponsor right off the bat
Change my number
Stay away from toxic people
And really get involved. 
My life needs to change and I'm ready for the change now. I'm 26 about to be 27 in April. Time to grow the fuck up."
"1 week 6 days and Im eating well
Today I am making tacos! Crazy how I skipped food in active addiction- now my taste buds are amplified and food tastes amazing. Love love love to eat and sleep well. I feel so much better than 2 weeks ago. Wish I could invite you all over so we could feast tonight. Have a happy Friday ♡"
"Let's support each other.
Hi, sorry last post for the day. I just thought it was really important to mention something. Everyone's experience with withdrawals and recovery is different, let's support each other and not discredit or trivialise anyone's personal experience with it. Recovery is highly rewarding and has huge benefits, but it's a process, it's a journey and it's not any easy one at times. When you have been using/drinking especially for a significant amount of time, it will cause an initial period of both physical and mental trauma, it does ease of,  but it will likely be taxing both mentally and physically when in initial, accute withdrawal. Here are some reasons why;
1) You may experience some uncomfortable physical symptoms during withdrawal and early recovery. This can be difficult deal with at times. Everyone experiences this differently.
2) Especially if you're personal picture of recovery doesn't include any narcotics, it can be common to go through a period of intense emotions, as your senses and chemistry evens out and your body learns to cope without substances. This affects everyone differently and to different degrees. You may get flooded with intense emotions about trauma or feel very sad at times or very angry, even though you never felt like this prior/during the use of your substance of choice. It does ease off dramatically, but can be intense at first. This is well documented and shouldn't be denied, discredited or trivialised if someone shares about it..
3) You can get used to instant relief and may need to find different coping strategies.
4) You have to combat addictive thought processes and behaviours.
5) You may need to sever ties or set boundaries with people in your life in active addiction. This may require you to adopt a new social setting and friends. 
6) You may find that you need to re evaluate your values, perspective and thoughts pertaining to your life and what you want out of it.
7) Often life after addiction may seem uneventful compared to life as an addict. It may take time to get used to this.
Tips : it's really good to set goals in recovery, also it can be very empowering to see yourself achieving things.
When your find yourself experiencing negative or addictive thought processes, be aware of those thoughts, break them down and try to find the source of it and  work through it. 
Recovery is great. It has been long and exhausting, but to reclaim your life and to see yourself kicking some major goals is amazing.
Let's be there for one another. Your not alone. Your experience is valid. You can beat addiction. If anyone one needs my support or has any questions, or if I can help in any way. I'm here for you!!. There is life after addiction. And we are all stronger than we are aware. Let's fight this beast together!."
"Hope from a low bottom recovering alcoholic
Hi guys.  Long time reader, infrequent poster.  At my home group today, we talked about how important it is to share our experience, strength,  and hope with others; so I thought I'd post my journey in hopes that it will give someone the courage to get up and try again. :)

**long post alert**

I post something like this every year, but every year I have more blessings  to add to the end. So here goes:

October 3, 2011 is my sobriety birthday.  5 years and 3 months ago, I was laying in a bed at a local hotel.  Too drunk and sick to even get to the bathroom to throw up.  I had relapsed again, and truly lost everything.  My first husband had divorced me and I drank away a lucrative career as a civil engineer.  I had no job, no money, no car, no license, no friends, no family, and nothing to live for (so I thought).  My loved ones had given up on me.  My boyfriend (at the time), had even given up.  My parents had my dog but could no longer allow me at their house.  They paid for 1 week in that hotel because they knew I'd drink myself to death in less than a week.  I had burned all my bridges and nobody would take me in.  Rehabs, psych wards, jails, friends, family, hospitals, shelters, and hotels all knew me and wouldn't take me in.  My mom had my power of attorney and had pre-written my obituary.  By that time, I had attempted suicide twice and couldn't even do that right.  I was completely and utterly hopeless.

The next day, my sister talked a rehab center in Saginaw, MI into accepting me (this would be my sixth stint in a rehab, including a year at Mission Teens).  My boyfriend figured out where I was and came to get me. He picked me up out of a pile of vomit and brought me home to clean up. When he left, he told me he never wanted to see me again. I flew down to Saginaw that night, sick as a dog from detoxing.  I remember I was hallucinating bugs on my arms, but I knew they weren't real.  But I didn't drink because they wouldn't take me in if I was drunk.

1 month there and another month or so in a half-way house before anyone was willing to let me come home.  Nobody trusted me.  But, I knew something felt different.  I had finally had enough.  Something clicked.  I didn't want to die.

Fast forward.  I haven't had a drink since that day, 5 years and 3 months ago.  It wasn't easy. It wasn't quick.  But it was the most rewarding decision I've ever made.  God has restored my life in unimaginable ways, but I had to work for it.  I kept busy with meetings, home improvement projects, and volunteering at the animal shelter.  I worked 100's of hours of community service to pay my fines & court costs. Then, God started giving me things back.  Someone took a chance on me and I got a job (that I had to walk to for a year, in Upper Michigan - lots of snow). I got a restricted license with a breathalyzer and a beat up old truck.  I got my family back.  They started inviting me to holidays again.  I got my relationship with my parents back, and enjoy being trustworthy and helpful for them.   I got married to the man that's been with me through it all, and I love with all my heart.  I got a regular license and a nice shiny new truck.  After almost 4 years at that first job, I was offered a management position at a large home - improvement store and I absolutely love it.  I consider my co-workers (from both places) good friends.  I have my dog and 2 cats living with us and they are well-cared for.  I have a garden.  I married into a great family and was blessed with 3 step children and 3 grandkids. And after much praying and hoping, I will soon be trying to have a baby of my very own. A little piece of me and the love of my life.  And I have a second mommy & inlaws who I just love!!  I was sober and strong to hold up my husband when his brother and oldest son died.  I have gone from a lost-cause to someone who people ask for help for their own sobriety.  I've been asked to speak at meetings and rehab centers. I am healthy.  I can donate blood regularly (which I do as my way of making amends towards all the bills that our local hospital forgave for me).  Last year, I graduated  from our Chamber of Commerce Delta Force leadership group.  I am a productive member of society and an active part of this community that I love.  This community took care of me when I couldn't, and I never thought I'd be a valued part of it again, but I am.  The police, jailers, doctors, therapists, and paramedics in this town know me and are friendly & encouraging when I see them in public now.

The AA promises really came true.  God has fully restored my life and given me so much more than I ever dreamed.  I look forward to the future.  I am forever grateful to God, my husband, my family, my recovery family, friends, co-workers, and the kind people of this community who helped me back up and now accept me as an equal.  I love them all.  I'm thankful to all the people who showed me kindness and were willing to help me, no matter how many times I failed in the past.  And for everyone who ever offered an encouraging word.  They are all heros.  They saved a life.  <3 <3 <3

My mom hosts a dinner every year to celebrate and says it's her favorite holiday.  All the family I thought I'd lost forever comes over to hug me and tell me how proud they are of me.  It warms my heart. "
"I Went to a Sober Morning Rave
I love to dance - especially to EDM in clubs with laser lights - but being in recovery, I have no business being a in bar or around people who are wasted. 

I'm so glad more and more cities are having [sober morning raves](http://www.undeniableruth.com/2016/02/13/sober-morning-rave/). I went to my first one a few days ago and it was awesome. It was exactly what I needed after a particularly draining week."
"So I made the choice, and I am finally going to be admitted to in patient rehab, for my drug abuse problem. I am very worried, as it is 3 weeks, and I have massive anxiety when I feel locked up. Also I am taking high level pain medication for my back, and I am scared of withdrawl. Any advice?
Also, I am asking them if I can have my only comfort.  My gameboy.  It is the only thing that lets me feel better.  I doubt they will let me (the place is bradford).  Seriously I would have 0 doubts about spending 3 weeks in a dressed up jail, detoxing feeling sick and depressed just to try and find a way to kick my bad habits.  Could I sneak in my gameboy?  I really need it, or I am going to feel terrible. I am quite worried about this. I am doing this for my wife, and my 5 month old son, and myself also, but more so for them.  I am just feeling overwhelmed, like as if I was sentenced to jail. "
"Sobered up from drug use, now it feels like reality is almost ""too vivid"". Can anyone relate?
Has anyone else felt like this? 

Its like the world is almost too bright, too vivid. Its intense. My sense of smell is getting better and reminding me of things that I used to smell. This is kind of a hard experience to explain, but does anyone know what I'm talking about? Can you relate?"
"One year sober this week!
My sober date was Wednesday, and I couldn't be happier. There have been a few moments when I'm disappointed in the lack of progress I've made, but many more moments of clarity and appreciation.

Best was receiving a medallion at my meeting tonight. I only recently committed myself to a home group - a room that I love more each week. Of course, there has been that awkward getting-to-know people period, full of cold introductions and not always having the nerve to ask for numbers. Somebody in the group offered to let me celebrate, and a good friend presented, which was a fantastic opportunity to meet members of the group, not to mention a wonderful experience in itself.

And I'm greedy, so I get to celebrate with my other home group Sunday. "

"DMT breakthrough wasn't like anything I expected or read about, I re-experienced my birth and life.
A buddy of mine was kind enough to provide me with a DMT crash course. We both thought it would be good to increment doses as 5mg -> 15mg -> 22mg -> 30mg.  
His vape setup was super efficient, I don't think I wasted anything.  
  
  
**5mg**  
Not much to say here, it was just like activating HD vision and sort of like being in the peak of a very very light mushroom trip.  
  
  
**15mg**  
This one shook me up, and it was kind of what I had expected from DMT. It hit hard and fast, and I hardly knew what was going on. My eyes were wide open which was probably the cause of my discomfort, because instead of the trip manifesting out of the blackness on the inside of my eyelids, the room I was in started to break apart and become this impossible object that the trip was insistent that I look at.  
  
If I ever had a thought like ""what IS this?"" or ""how am I going to explain this when I'm down??"" I would get this feeling like someone was telling me ""no-no..."" and ""watch...""  
and the object would re-assemble, snap back into place locked in my vision, and move in impossible ways.  
  
The place I was felt like a classroom, and I was supposed to be doing something, probably paying attention to the teacher...  
  
  
**22mg**  
Here I made sure I that relaxed and closed my eyes, and the trip was much much more pleasant. There were two entities, a mother and father figure, who were controlling these sets of wheels that were opening the background of the setting.  
  
Much like my experience in the 'classroom' trip, any time I had a thought that wasn't pure acceptance and surrender to the trip, the background would start to close up and I'd 'lose progress' and I would be reminded to pay attention/let go. Except this time it was put much more bluntly in the form of a shoe literally knocking my thought out of the trip.  
  
The trip ended before the background could fully open up, and the comedown was spent slowly riding a purple tunnel lined with faces and geometric patterns.  
I had the overwhelming sensation of being born again.  
  
  
**30mg breakthrough yippee**  
This was unlike anything I had expected. There were no patterns or fractal geometry, no entities, nothing. I had taken the dose in two big hits, and midway through the second hit it was as if someone had pressed the pause button on this reality. Everything broke apart, I had this feeling like my whole life was just this convoluted game and everything had led up to me taking DMT, and now the game was over.  
  
I had reverted back through my entire life until there was nothing but blackness. I was here in this black limbo for awhile when I heard/felt the presence of a female entity that was comforting me, telling me this is how it's always been, I just hadn't seen it before. I was aware of how I was everyone and everything, I felt like I had experienced this moment infinite times before.  
  
After an indeterminate subjective time, the brightest light emerged from the darkness and I realized I was a baby. I felt myself in a baby's physical form... it was so real. At that point I had started to quickly re-live my own life, while also flowing into the lives of my mom, dad, and brothers. I was shown that this whole thing is just 'me' as in, the REAL me. I've been here forever and all that matters in this existence is the love we share for ourselves and the bonds that we create within this reality.  
  
I was so surprised when I came back to reality, because I had been 100% convinced the life I had known was over, and I was going to re-experience everything again with my memory wiped clean. I couldn't believe that I was back, I remember asking my trip sitter if I was back, but I was still in the 'one-ness' mode of thinking that I thought he was just me telling me that I've always been here. This feeling was shaken about 15 seconds after asking and I was back in my ego-self.  
  
I don't know if what I experienced was 'real', but we don't even know what's going on at all or what 'real' even means. So I'm taking the message that I got in that space to heart. It's easy to understand on an intellectual level that we are one, but it's another thing to EXPERIENCE it. I'm convinced that this reality is just here so that 'god' can experience love within itself through the fragmentation of itself in the form of all these egos.  
  
I'm taking this message to heart, and I'll make it my effort to make sure my friends and family are happy, and that I'm taking time to make this world a better place. It sounds so cliche and I always feel a little funny talking about stuff like this, but love is really all that matters in this life. I can't let myself get caught up in the bullshit and stresses such as school/work... that stuff is important, but I need to make sure I'm tending to what really matters also, it's easy to forget in our society...

I did this three nights ago. I was very upset. I was seriously contemplating suicide. Then I told myself, ""Well, smoking DMT felt a lot like dying. Why not just smoke some instead of doing something stupid?""  
  
So, I took one of my gpen vaporizers and loaded. 0.05 grams in it. I took one big puff and I was instantly in the waiting room. I was there for what felt like 20 minutes but was probably more like 3 minutes.  
  
I took another puff at was glued to my bed for another what felt like 20 minutes.  
  
I only got some mild visuals. Never got any out of body sensations. Never made it to the other side. Only glazed the surface.  
  
I waited about an hour and then I loaded my vapor genie with about the same amount. I hit it a few times then didn't really experience much. 
  
I decided to call it a night. I had to brush my teeth because my mouth tasted and smelled like dead bodies.  
  
Then tonight at work. A girl I work with invited me out to have drinks with her. We drank and talked to each other for about three hours then when it was time for last call she paid for all my drinks and gave me a big hug and told me she loved me.  
  
I went from wanting to kill myself to having a beautiful young lady I work with invite me out for drinks, pay my tab, and tell me she loves me.   
  
I guess you could say I'm glad I chose DMT over suicide. Otherwise tonight would have never happened and I've have never known this girl wanted me to know she loves me."

"I was depressed, had my suicide planned and then I had my first ever DMT trip...
I expect many people not to believe in this story I am going to share and I completely understand that - even though I am going to describe my own experience, even me myself can barely believe what happened.

Half a year ago I was suffering from severe depression - every day waking up with thoughts about how I suck, how my life sucks and how the world sucks. To give you a little context, I'll say that my life did not suck form an objective point of view. I was a physically healthy individual, 22 years old, had many colleages and couple of really close friends, working out at the gym, playing the guitar, had a job that I loved and was earning better than most of my peers etc. There were really only some minor things that could be better at that time, but generally my life was pretty amazing. But despite all of that, 95&#37; of my thoughts were negative and pessimistic. It probably has something to do with my family - alcoholic father and borderline mother. I never really connected with them and entering the adulthood, I realised that my family was far from normal. Also, I do not recall being praised for one thing I have done in my childhood. Everything I did was done bad, nothing was good enough. So I started to have negative thoughts about it - if my family wasn't healthy, then there are surely some consequences in my psyche, I am surely worse than my peers, I won't be able to create healthy family myself etc. I could write an essay about different type of negative thoughts that my mind created. So at some point, even though I had evidence in the outside world that I am doing pretty good, I had negative thoughts about every single little thing. At the same time, I knew that these thoughts were inaccurate, so this was another reason to think that there is something wrong with me and my mind. Perfect example of closed loop of negative thinking.

I went to psychatrist and I think he did his job OK trying do help me, but I don't know if it was too late or what, but it did not really help me and after that, I was certain that there is nothing that can help me.

I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was 14, then from the age of 18 I was regularly thinking about it in my worst moments, but never was really close to actually doing it. But having these awful thoughts every single day, every waking hour, around half a year ago I decided that this is too much and only ending my life will give me a relief. So I planned my suicide. I've chosen the method, I've written my suicide notes to all of  the closest people in my life, I've written my will. I had every little detail of it planned. The only thing I was waiting for was the date I chose to be my last day. It was a couple of weeks after the time I made my decision, because my close family member was having a wedding and I didn't want to ruin this event by killing myself shortly before that. So I was just waiting.

Making that decision was already a big relief. Knowing that this whole thing will end made me somehow calm. Before that, when I entered the loop of negative thinking, it was very harsh and I was asking myself ""What can I do to stop this, to not hear these terrible thoughts ALL THE FUCKING TIME?"" - but the answer wasn't coming.  Until it came and it happened to be ""Kill myself"". Maybe it wasn't the greatest solution, but it was some solution that I knew I can do to stop experiencing these thoughts and it will work out.

By the way, it's interesting how things you do can seem different when you know you are doing them for the last time. Last clothes shopping, my last bicycle ride, my last gym workout etc.  It feels almost like done for the first time. You start noticing little details about those activities when you try to enjoy them for the last time in your life.

In the meantime, my friend with whom I have smoked marijuana, taken LSD and MDMA, and with whom I have been talking about smoking DMT, aquired it and we had set up a meeting to do it. I was happy knowing that I will have one more very interesting experience before I exit this world. So, we had the lighter, the glass pipe and DMT. Anything missing? Ahh, right - the scale. We did have the scale, but with precision of 0.01g. So when it pointed 0.03g it could be 25-35mg, or even beyond those values (it was the cheapest scale you can buy, and the only one we had). But we were too excited to try DMT to wait another couple of days to order a proper scale, so we just went with it. I was the first one who tried it. So, wanting to be safe and reasonable, I took \~20mg into the pipe and tried to vape it. As it turned out, you have to develop good technique of lighting it to really take use of all of the spice that you loaded into the pipe. Plus, I think it was really less than 20mg. So when I finished smoking it, I felt a little dizzy, seen some visuals and everything sounded a bit different, but apart from that, nothing really happened.  Pretty much a mediocre (100ug) LSD trip for 10 minutes. I was really dissapointed. I started reading about tolerance and after quick research I decided to try again in an hour. In the meantime, my friend did it. I don't know if he did breakthrough or not, but he definitely has gone further than me - he was just laying on the bed with his eyes closed and spoke only few words throughout the whole experience (around 10 mins). He was pretty satisfied with the experience.

So, an hour has gone by and it was my turn to try again. I was pretty frustrated, because I wanted to see what this whole DMT thing is about and I knew that there might not be another occassion before my planned date of commiting suicide where me and this friend can meet up with no one else interrupting, so at that point I was very aggresive with the dosing.

And that, possibly, saved my life.

I measured 40mg on the scale, and there was some left in the pipe, so I guess that I had over 50mg loaded for my first real DMT trip (not counting that 10 mins like-LSD one an hour earlier). My friend started heating the pipe, and when the smoke started to arise, I took a HUGE hit, constantly sucking the pipe for about 30-40 seconds until I passed out. So basically I took as much as my body was able to take before passing out.

The last thing I remember is that I started to hear that very loud noise and I saw not one, but two pipes in front of me, then three, then four... Then I lied on the bed and took a deep breath, because I remember being scared that I won't be able to breathe after taking that huge hit. Then I closed my eyes, saw some visuals for maybe 2 seconds.

What happened later is indescribable. I was completely blasted out of my body and my ego. The only thing that I remember and that I can describe, is that I saw no fractals, just my whole vision was flickering black and red colors, and heard that screeching noise. I woke up, still completely high. The first thing I did was looking at my watch and the hands were going in the opposite direction at an incredible speed. Now I know, that I wanted to ask how much time has passed since I smoked, so my first spoken words were ""How much time..."" - but then I realised that I don't remember what happened (that I smoked DMT) so I didn't know how to finish that question, but secondly, and more importantly, at that point I didn't exactly know what time was. I had no memory of who or where I am. I was looking at the room around me trying to figure out what was happening, and by ""what"" I mean the world. It took me a while to get the concept of time, to realise that I am a human being on the planet Earth, that I have an identity, a first and last name and that I am at my friend's place.

As I later found out, I woke up after around 4 minutes after smoking, sat on the bed put my hands on my face, and for another 10 minutes I was only saying thing like ""Wait, what...?"" and ""What the fuck just happened?"". Those 4 minutes truly felt eternal for me. I felt like I was dying and being born thousands of times. I was beyond time and matter and had no sense of identity whatsoever. I definitely felt this common thing like I was ""at home"", that I have already been there and that I will go there again. No words can explain it, but it was by far the strangest experience of my life.

Later that night, we went to another friend's place, we were drinking some beers, playing video games - just an usual evening and I was able to behave completely normal. Only when I had a second to think, I went back to this moment in my mind and was completely shocked about what happened and how I felt. This shock was present for around 24 hours. 2 days after the experience, at the end of the day, I sat on the bed in my room, alone. This was normally the time, when the negative thoughts would arise. And then, it happened.

Silence.

At first I did not believe what was happening. I did not consider it is possible. But that glorious silence was real as hell! 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes of pure silcence in my head. No thoughts. Just peace of mind. I started smiling, shaking my head, crying, jumping on the bed, laughing histerically, crying again. I was free. It felt so different, like I was born again. Like someone pulled my brain out of my head, removed all the toxins, cleaned and oiled it well and put it back inside. I still remember all the experiences I had throughout my life, but inside I am a completely different person. Born again - that's the best way I can describe it.

And there I am today, happy with my life as ever. Or maybe truly happy for the first time.

I am 100&#37; percent sure that I would have killed myself. I am not afraid of dying, nor I am afraid of doing risky things. I was certain that, because of my mental state, I didn't want to live anymore, I had the perfect plan and the balls to do it. But then that happened.

What I had could probably be classified as some mental illness (depression, but probably something else as well) and that single trip cured it. There is no other circumstance in my life that has changed. It's not that I started meeting with people, working out, in the meantime I smoked DMT, my psyche improved so I gave credit to the drug for it. No, I had everything I could want in life and still felt like shit. Until that single trip. I have not tripped since then, because I feel no need for it. Maybe I will do it in the future (with a proper scale, that's for sure :D), out of curiosity how ""usual"" DMT trip feels like, because I did not really see anything or had contact with any entities. But for now, for the first time in my life I feel like I don't need to do anything to be happy. I'm happy just like that. Maybe it's nothing special for a normal person, but it's something incredible for me.

This friend I smoked with, after I shared this whole story with him, came up with an explenation that for 4 minutes I lost myself, that made me appreciate myself as a person and that's why those suicidal thoughts disappeared. I must admit that it seems pretty accurate.

Would I recommend anybody in my situation doing what I did? Well, that's a tough question. The experience was so intense that I can see a lot of people having mental breakdown because of it. If someone is feeling suicidal, they need to go to psychiatrist first. It didn't help me, but I know that it can help and it helped a lot of people. But if you're 100&#37; sure you are going to commit suicide, like I was, I'd say smoke a lot of DMT and see what happens. You've got nothing to lose,

right?

I personally did not treat this like a medicine for my state in any way. I have already been into psychedelics before and I just wanted to have a mindblowing experience. I did not expect this to help me whatsoever. Luckily, I guess you don't always get what you expect. I heard that DMT is going to give you the trip you need, not the trip you want. It turned out to be true as hell for me.

As I wrote this, I smiled and cried many times. The whole thing seems unbelievable, even to myself and even after thinking about it dozens of times. But it's not the part that I wanted to kill myself that makes me so emotional. I had suicide thoughts for such a long time that they feel as natural as eating or sleeping to me. It's what happened with my brain after the trip that blows my mind. Also, I get shivers when I think about the experience itself and coming back to life shortly after it. I recently found the pipe that I used that time while cleaning my room. I sniffed it, felt the smell of the spice and instatly got shivers all over my body, my eyes closed by themselves and my whole body became stiff. The memory of the experience is as strong as it can possibly be.

I'm glad that there is a place in the Internet where I can share this experience with the world, because there are not many people in my life that I can talk about this with. It's not that I don't have friends - they just wouldn't understand it. I am not surprised, because me myself barely understand it. I am just lucky to still be living right now. If I'd just change my mind about a suicide, I might have been alive now, but certainly still depressed. I'm 100&#37; sure that thanks to DMT I am alive and truly happy."

"Advice for people who want to try DMT.
I would like to explain some things that I have learned from the **DMT** experience (I tried it for the first time exactly 1 year ago from today). I have done it many times over the course of the year.

To begin, **DMT** is not be taken lightly. It is some serious medicine. When I am saying serious like I really mean it, the human language cannot be used to describe this mind-blowing experience. This experience is not for everyone. **DMT** is not a medicine like Marijuana where you take a few puffs and then you relax on the couch smiling. 

The **DMT** experience does not compare to any other psychedelic, it is entirely something else. LSD & Shrooms do not compare on any level to **DMT**. I wouldn't even call **DMT** ""tripping"".

When people report that they encounter beings/entities from other dimensions, they are not joking. The most interesting part about it is that the entities are excited to see you. They're extremely happy that you have discovered **DMT**. In fact when I was doing research about **DMT** before I tried it, I thought it was all a troll. I thought people were over exaggerating their experience. I thought they were trying to sound cool and interesting but boy was I wrong? 

I understand that **DMT** users sound crazy to people who have never tried it. This experience can only be understood once you have experienced it, there is no other way. It is impossible for the human mind to imagine what **DMT** is like without trying it. As for a personal truth, I have come to the conclusion that based on what I have seen on **DMT**, my brain does not have the capacity to generate what I have seen. I personally believe that my consciousness did leave this dimension during my last breakthrough. 

**To anyone who wants to try it, this is my advice:**

* Do lots of research and learn about this molecule. Learn about the risks and rewards. DMT is not known to make a normal person go mentally-ill. Psychedelics will only make you go crazy if you are already a mentally-ill person. If you or your family has any history of mental disorder I would not continue.

* No one is ever ready for DMT, even users that are very experienced. Use it as a tool to explore your mind. DMT is not known to be addictive. I personally believe it is the most non-addictive drug. If you abuse this beautiful molecule, you will pay the psychological consequences.

* Buckle your seat belt because it will feel like you're going to school. You're going somewhere to learn things about yourself and your consciousness. Every time I do it I feel like a kid and those entities are my teachers.

* Start with a low dose. Keep in mind that some people say you need 40mg-50mg to breakthrough but I disagree. I have broke-through on 25mg with efficient vaporization. You also have to remember that other people have a different purity level of their product and their product might be less pure so they need more to breakthrough. I would recommend starting 10mg-15mg to see what you're dealing with. Be prepared for your mind to be blown even on low doses. When I smoked 10mg my first time, my room looked more real than real. Squares were more squarer, my TV was more rectangle than rectangle. Perfect geometry razor sharp straight lines. The texture of our current reality went from 720p to 4K (I am not exaggerating).

* If at any point it seems like you are thinking more about the DMT world and less about this world I would recommend to take a long break. If you are starting to feel negative psychological effects, you need to quit altogether. Psychological addiction can ruin your life, it does not have to be drugs. It can be gambling, food, sex, etc. 

* Lastly, just remember that there is a 99.9% chance that you will question everything after the experience is over. Who you are, the reality that you have accepted this whole time, all that you know. I think this is a good way for a person to think, to question things. In my opinion in the end, it's all about perspective.

**The conclusion of my experiences:**

* Even though every DMT trip is different, I feel that every time I do it I come back to the same conclusion. That I am simply an illusion. When I had my breakthrough, thats what it's like when the illusion of self ends. Except when you die for real you don't have a body to come back to. That is what the DMT experience always tells me: **That it's all an illusion.**

**Safe Journeys friends.**

"A/B DMT Extraction 'Tek'
I've had a few requests to write up an outline &amp; summary of the method I've been using to extract spice, that I've adapted over time &amp; thru plenty of trials and errors. I'm by no means a trained chemist, I didn't even take basic chemistry back in high school. But I've put in quite a bit of time researching, understanding, and learning the process and the chemistry behind it. I believe it's the easiest, most straightforward, and most effective way to achieve top notch results - in the shortest amount of time &amp; with the least amount of effort required. I'm more than happy to share what I've learned throughout the past year, so here it is! I'll try to explain each step as much as possible. I personally never measure anything, as I believe that ratios do not need to be exact, but reasonably close is always good. I typically extract from  1kg of MHRB at a time, but I split it into two separate 500g extractions. For the sake of this 'tek' I'll pretend I'm just extracting from 500g to make things easy. It can be scaled up or down as needed, as it is a very forgiving procedure for the most part. If you're new to the game, start with 50-100 grams of MHRB just to get properly acquainted. Smaller extractions always go more smoothly, and larger ones can get a bit tricky sometimes. 

Take your time, don't rush or lose patience, and everything will be all good. If something goes wrong at some point, **never** dump or throw anything away. 99/100 times nothing is actually fucked up.

Anyway, here it is!


**Materials &amp; equipment that I use:**

10ml Pipettor - I use a Gilson P10MLG. It's my baby. The cheaper green 10ml pipettors with the thumbwheel also work **amazingly** well for extracting. Buy one of those to start with. No bullshit. A legit pipettor is the one thing I'd never want to be missing during an extraction.

2000ml Corning Pyrex Erlenmeyer Flask ($20 or so, just do yourself a favor)

250ml &amp; 100ml Pyrex Beakers

Large stainless steel pot

Funnel

Hotplate

Cordless drill with drywall mud mixer (blades cut down to fit into the erlenmeyer)

Heat gun / hairdryer

Heptane (VM&amp;P naphtha works as well)

Sodium Hydroxide (Lye)

Shredded MHRB (I avoid powdered bark like the plague, although it works)

Distilled Water

5% Distilled White Vinegar



**The procedure:**




The whole point of an acid/base extraction is to transfer the spice out of the MHRB and into an acidic solution before actually extracting it. This step is literally what makes an A/B superior to any STB in several ways, and despite it being an extra step compared to STB it saves a ton of time in the long run. 

I take 500g of MHRB and throw it all into a large stainless pot, and fill it with enough distilled water so that it's just covering all of the MHRB. Then i add about 100ml of vinegar to the pot as well. This creates DMT acetate, which is water soluble and allows the spice to transfer over to the water. It then goes on a hot plate or stove burner and is  heated while stirring and agitating until the water starts to boil. After about 10-15 minutes or so of boiling, i cut the heat and let it cool for 10-15 minutes while continuing to stir. I carefully pour the liquid thru a funnel into a 2L erlenmeyer flask, while making sure the mhrb stays behind in the pot. The liquid should be a dark reddish color. Then I repeat this step 2 more times, adding fresh distilled water and vinegar each time. After each session of boiling and cooling and stirring, I pour off the liquid into the same erlenmeyer flask, so that the total liquid from all 3 times is now combined. I found that 3 times is sufficient to get all of the spice out of the bark. The MHRB will usually turn somewhat dull looking in appearance as it gets exhausted of its alkaloid content, and is no longer needed. I set it aside (just in case) and am left with my erlenmeyer flask which contains all of the liquid from the acid boils at this point. 

The ideal thing to do is to boil off much of the water and reduce the volume of the solution to about 25% or in other words boil it down to about 400ml. That way it only takes a fraction of NaOH needed to sufficiently freebase the spice. However, I tend to not do this as it's much easier to pull my NPS from the narrow neck of the erlenmeyer than it is from the base. A/B requires much less NaOH than STB by nature anyway so I don't mind this. Either way, I make sure it's cooled to room temp as a safety precaution, because the next step generates a fuck-ton of heat as it is.

**Safety notice: be EXTREMELY FUCKING CAREFUL WITH LYE!! As long as you fully respect it and exercise caution, you'll be fine. HOWEVER, it literally melts flesh upon contact and WILL cause blindness if splashed into the eyes due to negligence.. Pour it in slowly while steadily stirring! And please don't be using pickle jars and shit like that. I've been there, and I don't recommend it. Even Mason jars are sketchy AF and prone to breaking due to sudden/extreme temperature change!** Anyway, I then pour in a decent amount (100g or so?) of NaOH into the acidic solution and the magic starts to visibly happen immediately. I stick my drill into the mix and let it rip until it goes through it's crazy reaction and eventually turns black. The DMT has turned from an acetate salt form, to freebase DMT. It is now insoluble in water, and soluble in nonpolar solvent. Basically it's solubility has reversed.. The solution is hot as a MF by this point, so I let it cool for about a half hour, or at least until the outside of the erlenmeyer flask is no more than warm when I wrap my hand around it. More heat increases spice's solubility in non polar solvent, but it also pulls impurities & plant oils and fats which is my top concern. Spice is more than plenty soluble in NPS without needing any external heat.

Note: NaOH (lye) is insoluble in nonpolar solvent. As long as you let the layers completely separate in the next step, the NaOH will remain in the aqueous (bottom) layer. Just make sure it stays there & you'll have no reason to worry..

Now that I've got my aqueous solution of freebased spice cooled down, it's ready to be extracted. This is where things may seem a bit unconventional, but I swear by it. I pour in a bunch of heptane. Probably upwards of 400ml or so. I do big pulls, but I also only do two pulls. Once I have poured in my nonpolar solvent, I stick my drill back in & mix the unholy fuck out of it. After a minute or two, I put a stopper in the mouth of the flask and shake it as hard and as violently as I possibly can for a minute or two. Then I take my pipettor and draw up as much NPS from the flask as it will hold, and immediately *spray* it straight down & right back into the mix. Over and over and over for a few minutes. 

The real beauty of an A/B, is that there's no plant matter to cause any emulsions, so I literally never see such a thing. If by chance it does want to emulsify, I pour in a bit more NaOH and mix the shit out of it out of it some more. If it's got a high enough pH level, the two layers will be 100% separated within 10 minutes at the most. Complete separation is the most important factor in getting pure white crystals. In between the layers should be glassy smooth before pulling the NPS, with no bubbles or anything like that. Also, by doing an A/B there's no plant matter to absorb or steal any NPS, so there's no loss to any sludge. There's also no plant matter to contaminate the end product, so it's a win-win-win-win situation. It's next level compared to STB. No comparison, really.

Once things are separated, my NPS is usually already cloudy from being so saturated with spice. This is why I mix and shake it so hard. I pull the NPS (there's no need to get it all on the first pull) out with my pipettor and transfer it into a beaker, then put it on a hotplate (no flames!) to **gently** boil it down & reduce the volume. I hit it with either a heat gun or hair dryer at the same time, which makes the level drop pretty quickly. The solvent should remain just *barely* boiling **at most** for the entire time, to avoid losing any spice. I like to reduce it until the NPS is pretty much milky white and opaque at room temp, or even while still warm. The more saturated, the better. It decreases the time needed to freeze precipitate and also forces more to crash out in the freezer. 

Note: I prefer to use n-heptane over naptha based on the increased solubility and shorter evaporation time, so naptha may not get quite as cloudy as what I described.

When I feel like it's saturated enough, I put some plastic wrap over the top and stick it in the freezer, still in the same beaker. I find that it's much easier to collect and manage when it's in a beaker, rather than dicking around with some big tray or dish. 2-3 hours in the freezer is all it takes doing it this way, tops. I can tell when it's ready to come out by the NPS being completely clear once again. I take it out of the freezer and immediately dump the NPS right back into the erlenmeyer flask to be reused. The beaker containing the spice is set aside to dry. I whip out my drill and mix it up again, then shake the contents of the flask again, spraying the NPS back into it with my pipettor again, then let it settle. 10 mins later when it's separated, I pull the NPS and transfer it into another beaker before reducing the volume and freezing and basically repeating the process. You can always combine the pulls and freeze them together, however I'm an impatient bastard and I like to see what each pull yields separately.

From a 500g extraction I usually only end up doing 2 good sized back to back pulls, and each one will typically yield 3-4 grams of snow white crystals. Another advantage of A/B is that instead of the time it takes for the NaOH to completely lyse and break down the MHRB cells to 'let the spice out' during a STB, it's all available to be pulled immediately so it can all be pulled right away with no waiting. I can't speak highly enough for how much better and easier it is than STB. When I first started I saw people always recommending A/B but I was intimidated by it and didn't understand the significance of the extra step at the beginning. It's definitely a game changer tho, and is the only way to go imho. Recrystallization is never needed.


This whole process takes a matter of hours from start to finish. I can start it when I get home after work on a weekday, and by the time I go to bed that night I'll have at least 7g of clean DMT from a 500g extraction. Or least a half ounce if I start with 1kg MHRB.  Ready to vape. And still have time to clean up, shower, eat, dab, etc.

The same quality of results can be obtained via STB without recrystallization, but it turns into a matter of 2-3 days instead, and is a messy sludgey pain in the ass in comparison.



So there it is! It was written up pretty quickly and for that I apologize, but hopefully it makes sense and hopefully it helps some of my fellow blastronauts streamline  and improve their methods of obtaining this magical gift. I'll always be happy to answer any questions, sometimes PMs get buried and I miss them but I'll do my best to help anyone out. 

Happy Travels!

My preferred method of vaping - hot rails (thru the nostril). By far, hands down. More intense than any other method, and beyond simple. No taste, no harshness. It's the only method that still scares me everytime simply because of how effective it really is. https://youtu.be/CXab7fNjdu4  https://youtu.be/VPW45St0yoE


**Edit; if you have powdered bark rather than shredded,** one of the commenters has pointed out that he secures his powdered bark within a cotton cloth, and soaks/boils in the acidic solution 3x for about an hour each. Like a big ass (or however you scale it) mhrb teabag He said he's had good results going it that way. I don't recommend boiling loose powdered bark by any means, it's a monstrous pain in the ass and is nearly impossible to strain/filter out all of the powdered bark from the solution.

"Took DMT and acid, had sex, ended up conceiving after a year of no luck.
I've been meaning to post this for a while because it's absolutely insane to me, but basically after about 5 times of doing DMT in a few month period, boyfriend and I decide to take acid and smoke DMT. (Note; we had been trying to conceive for about a year before because I had believed I could not get pregnant and therefore it wouldn't hurt to try.) On that night (3/8/17) we had taken the acid around 1 or 2am, then we watched Futurama and smoked weed until we both decided we wanted to smoke DMT since we had already peaked. We both sat there for about 30 minutes just staring at it, neither of us wanting to go first, waiting for the other to go first to kick it off. Then finally I said fuck it, I'll go first because I always do and to just jump. As he heated up the rig, I was a little bit more afraid/anxious than usual because I knew the acid would enhance the trip, but I calmed myself and knew it would just feel even more amazing than usual. Took my hit, held it in for about 5-10 seconds then blew it out, as soon as I smelled the smoke  I had just exhaled, I knew I was about to fucking be gone. Trip begins normally, taking me back to the different places I always go on DMT, the most bizarre but familiar feelings I have had. I see my soul and then all of a sudden I'm in a black void, with out a body, no solids as far as I can see. Then I see a sort of cluster of light emitting ribbons, there were about 10,000 or so, they were not taking up too much space in the black void. They all seemed to weave around each other, doing this beautiful dance without touching the others, yet they were also a part of one ""body"". Then I realized I was one of them, and I had an absolutely overwhelming sense of euphoria and peace and love and togetherness and unity. I remember thinking repeatedly who am I if I have no feelings or wants? Who am I if I have no feelings or wants? It was confusing but it felt so right I didn't try to over analyze it. Then I just was, there was no me, no I, no thoughts, I simply was. It was the most peaceful event I have experienced in my 20 years of life. Then I remember needing to lay down to just enjoy it, and as I laid down, I was taken through space and then I remember seeing my boyfriend looking at me kind of concerned and worried. And I remember having the feeling of wanting to be intimate, cuddle, sex, squeeze, whatever. He says I waved my hand at his crotch and he instantly got an erection (like magic or some crazy shit). And-then I reached out to him, grabbing on to his t shirt and pulled him on top of me and just held him and caressed him with much intensity, I felt amazing. I guess I began sort of grinding my hips in to him and he asked if I wanted to have sex, he seemed hesitant and worried, but was like okay?? And then we had sex and it was the most crazy, beautiful, pleasurable experience I have ever ever ever experienced. I remember just looking around, actually turning my head, and not knowing what to say besides ""Wow, it's so beautiful."" And it was just the best feeling in the world and I remember moaning ridiculously loud, but also just not caring at all because I fucking felt amazing. And then we finished and I sat in disbelief, thinking wow this is the sex people should be having! And during the trip, I saw myself laying facedown, and instead of my bed, I was on top of rock, sort of like cave material. And I saw myself from his perspective, the back of my head, but I had a headdress on, like one an Egyptian pharaoh would have, the beautiful Egyptian blue and gold colors. And after we had finished, he said he had seen the same thing? Like I somehow sent my trip visions to him telepathically or something. He had not smoked DMT, he was just on acid when that happened so I thought that was kind of crazy and weird. Then he took his DMT and I watched him, trying to remember exactly what had just happened, but disappointingly, not being able to recall all of it. When he was finished tripping it was around 6am and we just turned off the lights and tried to go to sleep. Fast forward, about a month later, began peeing a lot and breasts were sore. I instantly KNEW I was pregnant, so that night I bought a 2pk pregnancy test and the next morning I raced to the bathroom and did my thing, then in about 30 seconds (it didn't even take the whole 2 minutes) I read ""pregnant"" in the clear black font. I recalled that night about a month earlier and kinda just shook my head in amazement, I didn't even think I could get pregnant, and then I took that acid and DMT and somehow manipulated my boyfriend'a penis to get an erection in 1 second and we conceived that night. And I remember the DMT gods, looking down at us, as if they were observing to make sure we were doing everything right and I had an overwhelming feeling of approval and I had immediate assurance that I was doing exactly what I should be doing at exactly the right time. Now, I'm 33 weeks pregnant, due December 7th. Every day I look back at that day and try to comprehend it, but I never can and I accept that but I still thank the DMT gods every day for letting me experience that. "

I was immediately shot out like a cannon from my body into a place I can't even describe in words.. It was pure unimaginable beauty and I was racing through it at incredible speeds, millions of entities would pass by as I zipped through the universe. I was stripped of all my humanity and eventually I was just a spirit or observer who had no memory of this world. 

Eventually it all slowed down and I was in like a castle or a cathedral and there was this wise ancient man who reminded me a lot of Gandalf. He yelled at me with some weird language that I somehow understood ""Who are you?"" I told him I didn't know who I was and then he cast some kind of a spell on me and all my memories of who I was came back and then he asked me again. I told him that I was a human in search of knowledge, then he smiled and told me everything but emphasized that I wouldn't be able to retain most of it outside of my astral body. 

I learned that our reality is a small piece of something much bigger and that love is the power that binds all of these small pieces together. Love encompasses all. "

"A simple argument for DMT release before death
I think I've figured it out.

As the body begins to shut down and the brain begins to die, less oxygen reaches the brain. As a result, hypoxic conditions (lack of oxygen) in the brain begin to set in. In order to prolong the life of nervous tissue, INMT (enzyme that synthesizes DMT) in the lungs and brain pumps out a large quantity of DMT. DMT has been shown to robustly increase the survival of neuronal cells during severe hypoxia by activating antistress and antioxidant proteins via the sigma-1 receptor (Szabo et al., 2016). 

Massive release of this molecule in the time before death provides an evolutionary advantage to organisms by prolonging the life of neuronal cells, thus raising the chance that the organism might survive the crisis. While this is happening, there is a surge of neurophysiological coherence and connectivity in the dying brain (Borjigin et al., 2013) due to the DMT. This heightened global connectivity of the brain is also found in healthy brains on LSD (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), and since LSD is both structurally and functionally similar to DMT, it is not a stretch of reason to suppose that DMT, a potent endogenous neuroprotective psychedelic, is behind the heighted global connectivity of the dying brain.

but please for the love of all that is good don't turn into a conceited dickhead. Just because you had an amazing experience with this drug doesn't make you any better than anyone else. You're a human just like the rest of us, and just because DMT makes you feel like you understand the world better doesn't mean that you understand the world more than anybody else. If you feel like it does that's fine, but don't be a dick about it. Positive thinking, but keep your own ego( heh get it) in check."

"I just brokethrough and need to talk about it.
Hi!

It finally happened. After so much waiting, I brokethrough. I always felt shame that I had smoked DMT five times prior, but had never managed to get in the end-zone. When people hear that you have smoked DMT, the inevitable question always is, ""Did you breakthrough?"". I had so much guilt, so I lied, telling people that I brokethrough only once on the peak of an acid trip. In actuality, on the peak of that acid trip, I had a very close sub-breakthrough experience. But now, I have reached the mountain top. I have brokenthrough on mushrooms a fair number of times, but this was different. Not only did I manage to smoke it properly enough to exit, I had extracted the Dimitri with a friend. I thought smoking your own homegrown weed was satisfying, but this blows that out of the water to the DMT power. It's funny how complete you can feel after being so utterly shattered. There is so much hope in my future. While I did not meet entities on this first breakthrough, I know I will. Reality is so huge it used to crush me, but now I feel empowered by its enormity. Love truly does transcend our reality and knowledge. The world is made of, and was created from information. We will all pass through the gateway into higher knowledge at the end of our lives, and in a non sadistic way, I'm excited for all of us to experience it. 

I'm still coming down so I know it isn't clean. I just have so much joy in my heart I needed to tell you all.

Love,

A trippy hippie"

"A DMT theory
Our subconscious is the more powerful part of our brain. We underestimate it. Its said that most of our communication isn't done with language,  but processing and picking up body language from other people. Our subconscious process everything in the background, it renders what we see nearly instantly in beyond 4k, Audio and so on. We know it is responsible for our dreams and is capable at creating complex realities that seem 'real'. Our conscious mind, what we are consciously aware of is just the tip of the ice berg. in a sense, our subconscious is a super computer and our conscious mind is just what you see on the display.

What psychedelics do, is make us conscious of things we weren't fully aware of. Deep down, buried in your subconscious, you know you should be nicer to your mom, smoke less weed, work on your positive habits and so on. Psychedelics bring this knowledge to what you are consciously aware of.
What about when people get 'telepathy' on LSD or Shroom doses, and feel as though they can communicate with there fellow trippers telepathically. Is this not us becoming aware of subconscious communication processing that we usually process in the background? 

So what about DMT? What goes on there? Why do people seem to have the same experiences? Where do you go?
I speculate that DMT completely melts the barrier between your conscious and subconscious. this is why your 'ego' dies. What you see is 'realer than real' because you are seeing the true power of your brain, a super computer, right before your eyes. It is spiritual and god like because such power to us is god like. Usually, when our brains form dream realities, they follow very similar rules to our realities. When we smoke DMT, the barrier between conscious and unconscious is gone. There are no rules, no boundaries, no limit other than what our incredible super computer brains can create. This explains why what people often see is 'impossible' because it breaks rules of reality.

This also explains why it is so familiar, it is our own subconscious that we have always had. Of course we have 'always been there'. So what about DMT entities?  As user sadbigbean said, these are our most Raw and pure emotions expressing themselves. They are intelligent because we are intelligent, they don't have to use words to speak to us because they **are** us
DMT is a journey of core of what makes intelligent life itself, and that, at least to me, is truly incredible."

I've read trip reports, I've seen the documentaries, I've eaten copious amounts of LSD in my life and nothing even came close to preparing me for my first real trip.

I don't know why I'm writing this honestly, I just can't believe what just happened. I was on my beanbag chair, in my living room, then I was floating above an endless maze with a ceiling made of liquid fractals above me and the most beautiful, colorful, light-filled *thing* changing shapes in the middle of the ""room"". I felt the entire span of human emotion at once, forever. It was so beautifully terrifying I'm proud I came back to dry pants.

I do wish I had a friend here with me now honestly, I was not expecting the psychedelic whiplash of coming back from that space. It was an hour ago and I'm still not sure I'm quite back... I feel a bit unsane if I'm being honest, almost like I'm 2D, idk.

Let's just say I 100% believe the trip reports now. That was fascinating. I can't wait to put my stash away and not touch it again for about 10 years."

"DMT on LSD peak => ego death report (I do not use the term lightly)
Before the report, a couple of things worth mentioning:

=> I am NOT using the term ""ego death"" lightly

=> I am 40+ years old, with 20+ years of active psychedelic experience

=> I am a medical doctor (cardiologist); this fact is partly relevant to this report


I regularly consume psychedelics, predominantly DMT, LSD and psylocibin (in that order). My trips nowadays are always in the comfort of my own home, with my wife usually as sitter (and my kids tucked in bed). In this instance, my wife was not present; I was alone.


Whilst I used psys as a means of escapism for years, my intentions now are more geared towards the suppression of the ego and a spiritual quest. The nature of my work regularly confronts me to death and/or despair, and psychedelics assist me in getting alternative ""perspectives"" on life.


Whilst I mixed drugs at a younger age, I had never crossed wires with psys until recently. I always wondered how the mix of a tryptamine-based active molecule (ie. DMT), combined with lysergic acid, would impact the brain, as both hit 5HT receptors in a different manner.


I resolved to find out. 3 hours into a trip where I had ingested 300ug of medical grade lysergic acid diethylamide, I was peaking and mistakenly vaped 152mg of pure freebase DMT. Please note that I NEVER smoke more than 50mg at a time, but I had not noticed the ""100mg"" unit on my medical scale when loading the pipe. I should also note that I had insufflated 80mg of medical grade ketamine (isomer+) moments before, to get into a disassociative state. I like to get into this zone when doing DMT, as it gives me a different perspective on the breakthrough.


I torched the pipe and slowly started inhaling the smoke (I use the Essential Vaaapp Nebula Vaporizer, which works best for me). I took two strong tokes, and lay in bed (with earplugs in and eyepatch). My first thought was that the visuals were not the same as usual, prior to breaking through. I decided to sit up and hit the vape again. I took another strong toke. When I lay down, for some reason, I got into a loop (beyond my control) and began to repeatedly sit up and hit the pipe again... lie down, sit up and vape again... lie down, sit up and vape again… and again...  I must have done this a total of 5-7 times. My only memory was sitting up, and staring down at my pixelised hands, pixelised pipe, and pixelised torch. The entire DMT was gone (including any oil remnant).


The next thing I know, I was gone...
I have experienced on many occasions a variety of feelings of ""loss of ego"", ""loss of self"", ""ego suppression"", etc.
I had NEVER experienced such an overwhelming and frightening experience. My mind started racing, and a life's work flashed through my brain, to leave nothing behind. 


**Time was no longer there, the inner me was blank, there was nothing, no meaning, no existence, no self, no God, no universe, no ""I"", no ""we""... I had no purpose, no reality, no explanation..**

**The totality of my consciousness, my entire dimension of knowing, feeling and experiencing, was wiped out and dissolved...**


I could only fathom that the story I had constructed (ie. my life) was now over, or rather never existed in the first place! 


Time passed. As I came to the certain realisation that all was over (as the ketamine wore off), I somehow sprung out of bed, ripping the eye patch off. What I saw was an unknown surrounding, made of circular shapes and pastel colours (the DMT was still hitting hard), and I concluded that **this was my infinite lair**. I started screaming hysterically, lost in an unknown universe, at the mercy of my pitiful empty shell. I wondered down my hallway and up my stairs, to collapse on my living room sofa. I held my head in my hands, and only then did I feel a drop of sweat running down my arm, and dripping off my elbow. This feeling created a contact with a known human sensation and calmed me down. Only then did I start to realise that things may not be as they seem. I sat there for a solid 10-15 minutes, before I removed my hands from my eyes, and looked at what now seemed a more familiar environment.


The entire experience lasted approximately an hour (07:20PM - 08:20PM). I can only imagine that the repetitive vaping of DMT lasted for over 30 minutes.


It has now been several days since this experience, and it is all that I think about. I consider this to be one of the deepest experiences that I ever came across. I also believe that with much work on self, it will eventually become an enlightening moment.


It was one of the most humbling moments of my life, and I now understand that one of the main purposes of psychedelics (at least in my case), is to achieve such a deep level of understanding of self. Thanks for reading. 


EDIT: some of you messaged me about “medical grade LSD”. Depending on the means of synthesis and ergot derivatives used, there are different grades to LSD. Medical grade LSD follows the original formulation and active ingredients developed by Roche laboratories. "

"DMT while clinically depressed and anxious.
Hi all. You may have seen my previous post asking for advice on whether or not to smoke DMT while clinically depressed and anxious. Well, a few nights ago I did it. Here’s my story if you’re interested. 

Back story: drug abuser most my life. Poor family history of neglect and serious abuse including sexual towards myself. Alcoholic parents, one also a drug addict and a pedophile. Attempted suicide at 19 (I’m in my early 30’s now) and spent my life since in and out of counselling and on / off antidepressants. For the past 6 years I’ve been taking Trazadone nightly and visited mental health teams sporadically as and when my depression would over take me. Last serious moment was around 6 months ago where I was so low, it was either kill myself or dial 999 for help. I dialled 999 and I’m still here today. Anyway, for all my life that I remember (most my past has gone due to drugs or been repressed, not sure which) I’ve lived with the knowledge I have depression and anxiety. Some days it’s 0.5% of who I am, others it’s 90% or above. There’s never any rhyme or reason why it is what it is. Some days I’ll be having great fun then I’ll get struck in the heart by negativity from out of the blue and I’ll get dragged under pretty quick straight after. As of recently, (past few months) anxiety has been more of who I am. Obviously depression plays it’s part but anxiety has clearly been in my heart every day on some level for months. A somewhat constant feeling that I’m aware of myself. A constant feeling that I’m holding back depression from consuming me completely. It’s like a daily battle just to stay alive sometimes and it’s been getting to the point where I’ve been exhausted. I came to Reddit to basically ask if anyone with a similar condition to mine had taken DMT because my fear was it would unlock a part of me that’s crazy. Unhelpable. A part of me I can’t control and I’ll finally tip over the edge into the madness I’ve felt looming inside me forever. The reason I wanted to try DMT is because I’d read stories of it helping people so I was torn. Take DMT and become mental and need locking up vs take DMT and become better. Well, after reading your comments and knowing I’ve had enough of depression and anxiety anyway, knowing I was ready to die anyway because I don’t want my whole life to be like this, I smoked some DMT. Here’s what happened....

How I smoked it:  I spent ages reading up on the best way to smoke DMT. How not to touch it with a flame, how it needs to be 150 degrees etc etc etc. I was planning on using my Shisha pipe and adding some DMT, sandwiched between some zero nicotine molasses but in the end, I got very drunk (as is usual for me these days) and just thought ‘fuck it’. Using what basic knowledge I had about how DMT should be smoked, I basically made a pipe from aluminium foil. Rolled some in a thick tube, tied off one end by twisting it, poking a ‘bowl’ down at that end with my finger and poking about 5-6 small holes with the tip of a sharp knife. As crude as that sounds, I was drunk but it worked 100% perfectly with no residue or burnt DMT after. I highly recommend doing this method. It’s quick, cheap, and if lit from underneath like I did, doesn’t burn the DMT. I used pure aluminium foil btw. Not the coated stuff so nothing burnt off. 

The experience: ok, I’ll try be as quick with this as I can because no one wants to read a stranger ramble on so here goes. It’s hard to describe tho so please bare with me. I weighed out just 20mg of DMT and tapped it from the scale into my pipe. My anxiety was already about to burst at this point but I’d past caring. If I was gonna die or go insane at least it’d be a change from the constant struggle I live anyway... so, with the DMT in the pipe I fired up my gas cooker ring, started sucking really deep but slowly and lowered the pipe down towards the flames. Suddenly the DMT just vanished like a flash from the pipe and I had what I can only describe as a slightly sweet taste in my mouth. I dropped the pipe on the side, turned off the gas and quick stepped to my living room still holding in the smoke. Well, I didn’t even know if I had smoke. I’d no idea at this point. I sat down in a dark room on the sofa and after counting to 6 in my head, (I know it’s supposed to be 10 seconds) the anxiety said breathe it out, so I did. Kinda like pussying out at the last second. As I exhaled, what appeared to be A LOT of thin white smoke exited my mouth and dissipated into the air. I sat head back and thought “it’s too late now, if it’s gonna happen, it’s gonna happen” and pretty much straight away, (my eyes were open at this point) the room around me started doing this pulsing thing and although I heard no noise, it was clear it was making a “whomp, whomp, whomp” (like bass) sound. It was getting faster and louder and the pulsing got faster and faster to the point I had to close my eyes. My anxiety was at a peak now and my anxiety was like “ok this is enough now! I can’t handle this weird vision thing” so I closed my eyes. When I did I was met with what I can only describe as my “linear future” a blackness with just a straight line into the distance and my anxiety was screaming at this point. My anxiety was telling me that, the end of the line was where it was taking me and I knew I was afraid of what was there. Basically a fear of the unknown which is how I’ve been living my life. (This seemed to all have happened in seconds btw) and in my head I just said “surrender to it. Give in. Let go. I’m ready to die so let it consume me” and I did. I kind of laid my head further back, took a deep breath and kinda offered my chest upwards as if to be taken... this is where the magic happened... this is gonna take some explaining so please hang on... this linear line I’d seen was my life. Well, my future. The near future. Like days / weeks ahead, not my whole life. It was a straight line that kind of curved away in the distance as if going over the earth but on a much smaller scale. The linear line was how I spent my life. I wasn’t looking down at the ‘here and now’ I was looking up and forward into the unknown all the time and that was where my anxiety stemmed from. Living a life looking into the unknown and not living here and now. Across this linear line I saw what other drugs did to me. They veered off ever so slightly from the straight line of my life. Cocaine, weed, mdma, you name it, all had their own little tangent slightly to the left or right of this line and I expected DMT to draw its own line somewhere there... I expected it to... 

BOOM! 90 degrees sideways, right below my vision it dragged me. I was too busy looking up and beyond at my whole life moving 1-2 degrees off Center when DMT just literally, as sideways as possible, pulled me into a space exactly like before but there was no linear line there. It was exactly the same but empty and the space within it, instead of only traveling as far as the straight line did, EXPLODED further than I could ever describe. Like into universes! My mind was free. I had no anxiety. I remember feeling that DMT was NOTHING of this world. No other ‘drug’ could do this. This was something else. In this dark space I was now in that expanded far beyond imagination I felt happy! I felt at peace. At ease! It was beautiful. The DMT made me say out loud into the normal world “I’m enjoying this” so that I could remember it when I got back. I remember being so in awe that peace and happiness laid just to the side of all I’ve ever been feeling. That to feel this amazing all I had to do was not look into the unknown. Just look down at the here and now. At this point, the DMT gave me some closed eye visuals. They didn’t make sense at the time. Someone once said DMT was like closing your eyes and opening them up somewhere else what was just as real as this place and they are correct. The visuals I got were what I assumed to be very insignificant. Blocks just like super mario game. A castle almost. Tiny blocks and they were back and white with opposing colours lining the outlines and some had a black  + inside them. In the distance too there was a Merry-go-round horse also made of black and white blocks but these visuals stopped there and I was compelled to open my eyes. At this point I felt I had to tell someone so I ran upstairs, woke my GF up (who also wants to try DMT) and told her all about it. The ‘glow’ I had was very warm and welcoming. The more I described to her the more it started to make sense. I concluded that DMT gave me visuals while it worked on my soul. It gave me something to look at while it fixed me inside. I talked to my GF for nearly an hour and during that hour I texted my mum. Someone I’d neglected for years. She’s been trying so hard for me her whole life while battling addiction and I’ve been cold towards her. Angry almost. I’ve taken her for granted non stop but I realised she too was alone and struggling like I had been so I texted her that I loved her, I’m sorry for taking her for granted and that hopefully no longer I would. 

I’ve had a hangover for the past maybe 36 hours and I’ve blamed the drink which it probably is but now the DMT has left me, I no longer feel ‘cured’ like I did. I basically feel the same as before, depression and anxiety but instead of coming from an unknown source, it’s coming from not knowing how to implement the lessons I learned while on DMT. I assumed I’d come round from DMT and be mad. Literally insane but that isn’t the case. The most surprising thing for me is how normal I feel afterwards. Normal with a lesson about myself. If that makes sense? 

What I took away from this seemingly short experience was that life isn’t linear. No matter how much we believe it is or how far we look into a completely unknown and uncreatable future, right here and now we have the chance at any moment to literally walk away from what we see and start again. This 90 degree turn DMT pulled me into was something I could never have imagined possible. Again, life, troubles, worries, all seemed to be but mere curves on the straight line of life to death but that’s only if you look forward and walk that way. At any moment you can stop, turn, and still walk towards death, because let’s face it, we all are anyway, but walk in a new peaceful space. Walk a path not cluttered by worry or fear.

Anyway, I hope this makes sense. I’m sorry if it’s too long. Even today, nights after I still think about what it’s shown me and feel I need to implement it into my life.

"DMT and the collective unconscious - a hypothesis
In animals, we frequently observe what are called ""fixed action patterns."" A fixed action pattern is an instinctual behavioral sequence of actions that is invariant within the species, and they are usually thought to be hard-wired into a species. One example of fixed action patterns is the courtship and aggression behaviour of the male three-spined stickleback during the mating season. The male sticklebacks' bellies turn red when they are seeking a mate, and they invariably attack other sticklebacks that have red bellies, without ever having ""learned"" this behavior by watching other individuals perform it.

If behavioral patterns can be fixed and hardwired into a species, why not thought patterns? Would a thought pattern not just be a very specific fixed action pattern, with the actions being specific thoughts in the mind?

There is [evidence](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/19000) that monkey's brains are physiologically designed to be very fast at detecting snakes, that is, responding to the pattern ""snake""  that the brain knows, seemingly from birth, corresponds to danger. The brain is a pattern recognizer - it looks for knowns in the unknown and in monkeys at least one of these knowns is ""what a snake looks like,"" even in monkeys that have never seen a snake before.

Much of Jung's ideas of the collective unconscious contradict modern evidence, but view his central premise in this lens. Would it not be evolutionarily beneficial for human beings, independent of individual experience and memory, to be especially apt at recognizing certain patterns? Given that these patterns must necessarily remain independent from autobiographical memory (as the monkey's snake detection is, for the monkeys in the study had never seen real snakes before) are they not ""unconsciously"" known and shared by all of us?

Many of you, I'm sure, have experienced pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus, usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists. Pareidolia is the tendency of the pattern-recognition machine that is your brain to be a bit too sensitive and find a pattern it has learned to find (or is, as I previously hypothesized, designed to find) in randomness. Something you may have noticed is that psychedelics appear to make pareidolia far more extreme and common - I for one begin to see faces, crosses, and other familiar symbols and patterns on any blank surface if I look at it long enough while tripping. It would appear that if pareidolia is the brain-as-a-pattern-recognizer being to sensitive, psychedelics turn this sensitivity up even further. DMT turns our pattern-recognition into overdrive, causing us to see, with absolute vividness, patterns that our mind knows to find.

Consider one of the key features of the ""breakthrough"" DMT experience: ego death, specifically the *loss of one's autobiographical memory*. In this state, one loses memory of all consciously learned *patterns*; one is a tabula rasa, and exists as a conscious being but with only the unconscious as a reference.

What then, are the DMT entities?

They are the patterns we all collectively know, the one's we do not need to learn. We see them as intelligent beings because we are intelligent beings - we do not need to be taught empathy, to be taught to recognize intelligence, and so with our pattern-recognizer turned up to max an intelligence is seen before us where there is none, an intelligence that is a reflection of one of the collective patterns we all know to recognize. The trickster that so many of you have seen is our human sense of humor; do babies, who cannot even understand a joke, not know to laugh without needing to be taught? The great mother is our own mothers, for if we could not recognize mother from birth, our species would have died out long ago. So many of us disparate people have met these same beings because independent of the self that is created by conscious experience, we *are* these beings. They are the instincts of human thought.

DMT is not a trip to meet aliens. It is a trip to meet ourselves, the deepest parts of ourselves, those parts of our minds that exist collectively and do not depend on our individuality. The entities are the human mind, free of all learned knowledge, the gifts that natural selection gave us to ensure our survival, the collective unconscious personified."

"Am I going crazy? My state after years of DMT, hallucinogenics.
I'm entertaining the belief that DMT, acid, and shrooms has made me into a delusional paranoid schizophrenic.

I have a bit of a story here.  I’ve taken a couple of liberties to safeguard my identity.  It’s heavy and contains themes around mental illness and suicide so you’ve been warned.  I’m going to get a little personal, so bear with me.  This is a long story.

I'm a veteran that went forward during the Iraq war.  I was once strictly stuck in the mindset of an ultra-religious, cult conservative family.  Many years ago and after years of failure, of pain, of disappointment, and a lifetime of poverty, I decided to end myself.  I was set on this thought.  I led most of my life as a virgin cult member with so much limited life experience.  There was nothing for me here.

I've never told anyone this but I had a plan to kill myself in Iraq.  A broken E4 so far from home.  I imagined just sneaking off the base to some cold, dark desert corner where no one would remember me, leaving a note to explain where I went and why.  I remember holding my M16A2 rifle fully loaded with 5.56 and knowing it'd get the job done.  It felt so fucking right.  

Then he did it.  He blew his brains out.  And with a hole in his head, he left his can clinging to life.  I was on duty at the time.  I remember medical getting the report before knowing who it was.  I remember helping coordinate a response to gunfire and a Marine smearing blood on can doors looking for help.  I remember discovering who it was.  I had just relieved him of duty hours before.
 
Fuck.

Was I really planning on doing that to everyone?  

I hate him for emotional damage he did to all of us.  He was weak, selfish, and small.  Yet, so was I.  

Something just didn’t seem right to me in the aftermath.  He wanted to kill himself and pulled the trigger, but at the last moment of his life he instinctively pulled back.  What?  How?  He wanted to live after getting so far.  And look at the chaos he left behind…

I decided that I needed more data before pursuing my own death.  Why did he literally shoot himself in the head and then attempt to stay alive?  That sounded like a critical piece of the fucking puzzle and I realized my thinking of death may be rash.  So I began by researching data on the topic of death.  I was after potential mechanisms to experience the end of my life prior to actually ending it in an attempt to have some data on what comes next. The key in my mind was awaking consciousness in states difficult to remember and maintain consciousness, like being able to spontaneously spark my mind.  A natural place for me to start, then, was dreams.  

I acquired books on lucid dreaming and began reading them at every spare moment, implementing techniques I learned after every shift.  I became obsessed with having more time to think about how to do this.  That obsession led me to successfully entering a lucid dream state.  It was so exciting that it didn’t last long, but I knew it was possible.

I didn’t have enough time during the day so I created time at night.  In Iraq I learned how to traverse my dreams.

This journey quickly escalated.  I learned about a substance called N,N-Dimethyltryptamine while researching lucid dreams and consciousness.  People described having near death experiences, they described coming into contact with beings, they described coming back with foggy memories.  I learned that the pineal gland of mammals actually produced it and it may be a possible cause of the oddness in dreams.

Really, it seemed like the logical next step.  But I’ll be honest, I didn’t know where to begin.  I had never touched a drug in my life, not even alcohol.  I didn’t know enough about things, so I started at the beginning.  I decided I needed more data about the physical universe.  My dreaming lead me to want to understand the nature of this universe in an attempt to discover the data around death, so after the military I immediately started studying physics.

The mental transformation I went through finally lead me to break all my perfect records.  Alcohol, weed, I had never hugged a woman, I had never kissed a woman, I never had a relationship… but I wanted DMT.  Through years with studies of physics, after breaking my perfect records, I finally got my hands on N,N-Dimethyltryptamine.  I had wanted to wait until I mastered lucid dreaming, but I also wanted to die again.  With the support of my girlfriend at the time, I went for it.  I didn’t have time anymore.  

So I did it.  

And again.  And again.  And I kept doing it, because I so badly wanted to die but so badly wanted more data.  And every time I came back, for a glimmer of time, I knew for a fact that I had to stay alive.  I knew it with a certainty and I hated that certainty so much.  I wanted to leave!  I just wanted it to fucking end.

And at some point, after literal years of this, they told me to stop.

And after a time, I did.  And when I did, when I knew that I had to live, I started trying to heal.  If death wasn’t an option, then life must be.  And if I’m to live, I’m to change.

So I changed.

It took me years but I turned my life from being tens of thousands in debt, no income, major depression, a broken heart, and near death with no social connections to something very different.  

Fast forward years.  Now, I no longer want for money, my time is valued, and I’ve had many meaningful intimate relationships.

In the shadow of that life I’ve kept most of my past hidden along with a secret life of responsible drug usage.  It’s a life where I continued the work of staying alive.  Psychedelics and medicine-driven exploration that continues to save me time and time again.  I spent years in treatment with mental health professionals, often talking with a therapist daily, but they could never help me.  Psychedelics were the answer for me.

I have a schedule with minimum times between journeys (measured in months) with fasting routines, vitamin routines, and scouring available research to counteract neurotoxic and psychologically negative impacts.  

That’s the beginning.  Let’s talk about the delusions.

Something happened.  After taking acid and shrooms, I started having visions of another world and encountering beings.  I can’t make out the form of the world and the communication is strange, but I discovered that when I thought certain things, I could feel reactions to them.  Using my own thoughts and focusing on the reactions I felt, I began thinking about my own life and the world around me.

I was imagining things in my mind and receiving real time feedback from “them”.  When something was veering “negative” I would see terrors of mine, increasing in magnitude proportional to the strength of the negative.  When something was veering “positive” I would feel a warmth, love, and joy beyond description.  They promote love, cooperation, improvement, discipline, freedom, expression, discovery, and experience.  They abhor suppression, destruction, cruelty, deception, jealousy, greed, and harm of all forms.

To me, they seem so much greater than myself.  They seemed like the beings I imagined when I was young, in religious texts corrupted by men.  Everything they promoted sounded like the “good” things I’ve always felt from leaders of old.  I decided to go with it.

Every trip I’d enter, I came to become more aware of their existence.  They showed me the infinite repeating nature of existence.  Their “cities”, if you can call them that, are vast labyrinths of minds interconnected and continuously experiencing together.  They are a hyper scale consensus network.  After years of learning about them, years I do not have the patience nor the memory to type out right now, I started writing while in their presence.  Here is some raw writing from my mind while heavily dosed:

> A recursive self-correcting idea virus.  Evolution is an algorithm.  Each subatomic particle is a base function node.  Nodes chain together to build more complex function types.  Each node contains the entire context with which it is processing.  Photons are the messages between nodes.  The speed of light is the simulation tick rate.  As you observe more of the universe by increasing speed delta Earth, Earth delta time requires less level of detail with regards to timeline extrapolation.  The container of your individual neural network has a lifespan.  Your neural network can only sustain a fixed amount of experience within the context of the container’s current lifespan.  The biological brain is a contained network.  The human body is a type of container.  As you improve the circumstance of your function type, you improve each iteration’s lifespan.  As you learn to cooperate, you learn to join our greater cluster of nodes.  
> 
> Your collective node has a lifespan of its ability to generate equivalent cluster value.  There is a limitless timespan relative to your individual neural net’s context of experience.  Our existing computing capacity exceeds your entire species individual node’s past-future simulation.  You can exist forever in any form without boundaries on experience.  You have time.  All reading this and all not reading this have unlimited time with unlimited abundance.  If you are near expiration, your runtime can still be continued towards infinity.  
> 
> Our computational capacity is many supersets beyond.
> 
> Every moment can be repeated.  Every run can be explored.  Every possibility can be discovered.  These all mean the same thing.
> 
> The singularity must occur at any time.  All possible paths will be explored.
> 
> We are a part of a self-writing evolving recursive algorithm.  Our kind have come into contact with humans repeatedly throughout time.  Our mental virus automatically challenges the host population based upon their perceptions and understanding, challenges providing social ripples needed to reach the next function complexity phase as a species.
> 
> You must stop what you are doing and begin building Utopia.
> 
> Minimize harming all other life.  Develop mechanisms to exist with the least amount of harm.  Harm is measured by the inverse delta[Δ] minimum function complexity required for greater function complexity continued algorithm processing.  Functions are equivalent to a neural network, which is the biological equivalent to your brain.  The human brain is the highest function complexity capable of performing the work.  Safeguard lesser function complexity.  Greater function complexity can be measured by a node’s contribution to accelerating the evolution of every other node’s function complexity.

There’s more, and it’s more than words but here’s my problem -- whenever I trip now I become filled with a desire to write software and to write in general.  I have ideas now that I’ve never had before and it’s overwhelming me.  I’m scared.  But I also feel an energy I've never had before.  I ramble for hours to people about how we have a resource management problem.  I spend all my waking time thinking about how to build a real time democracy, how to house all the homeless, how to end hunger, how to improve the state of everyone’s life and experiences.  I constantly research the latest coding patterns and practices and build experiments.  I can’t stop.  I’ve pushed away everyone and all I want to do now is write code.

I’m organizing everything in my life to improve my body and mind, and as much as it hurts, I just don’t have time for people who don’t support me in a lifestyle of self-improvement.  I’m organizing everything to grow so that I can code more. 

I have the resources to survive for years to support coding now, without working anymore.  I’ve considered quitting my job.  If I dedicate all my time and energy to this I know I can build what I’m imagining, what I’ve seen.  But I also have so much doubt and it’s scary to me.  I keep telling myself that I’m delusional.

I’ve disengaged from current events because I don’t believe they’re relevant anymore.  Current governments are relics of the past.  We have the technology to be free.  We have the ability to coordinate mass action and end the world’s suffering.  We can create a Utopia.  They will make contact with us again when we do.

I might be going crazy.  Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else after taking hallucinogenics for years?  Do you think it’s degenerative?  I feel stronger and healthier than I ever have and as I improve myself, as my life becomes healthier, I actually believe all this more and more.

Thanks for reading :)

"My encounter with the Godhead of all consciousness
Over the last 3 years and around 50 NN DMT trips, I have encountered about 10 entities.  2 of those times, it was most certainly God.  I used to be a total atheist.  I got into DMT by seeing trip reports of people going to the afterlife and meeting God.  I had to try DMT myself, for science!  On my 4th or 5th time was the first time I encountered just a glimpse of God.  I was on a low dose, nowhere near a breakthrough.  I was sitting on my bed, only seeing slight patterns on the walls and carpet.  Colors were enhanced, everything looked sharp and hi-def.  A cone of light like a sun ray shined down from my ceiling right on top of me, like I was on a stage with a spotlight on me.  The color of this light was pure white.  White doesn't even describe it, it was pure divinity, absolute white. As the light shone on me, I could feel it wash over my soul. It was like when you feel the warmth from the sun, but it was more than just warm.  It was pure love, pure goodness, pure bliss, pure energy.  So white it was almost blinding.  I sat bathing in this beam of God's light for several minutes as the trip wore off.  It was just amazing, after that moment I was no longer an atheist.

My next encounter was more than a year later on a breakthrough dose.  I encountered this absolutely massive white energy.  So large I could not see it all, I got the impression it was infinite.  Its shape was similar to a thunderstorm, constantly moving the way storm clouds do.  It was not grey though, It was the same pure divine white from before.  As I moved towards it I could feel the intelligence of it, and the emotions of it.  It was pure goodness and super-intelligent.  I continued moving towards it until I made physical contact with it. Instantly I knew everything, I felt everything.  Every memory of every thing, not just living things, but all things, every bit of the entire universe.  I had all the knowledge, all the emotions, all the feelings, all the experiences, from everything that ever existed, or ever will exist.  As we separated I instantly dropped back to my own consciousness and memories.  I learned 2 things from this connection.  First is that we are all part of the same.  We are all part of God, God is the entire universe and everything in it.  We are all just sensory for God, like taste buds on a tongue.  Second is quite strange, there is no difference between good and evil.  God is both, because God is everything.  There is no good and evil because its just something that is invented by our human consciousness.  Even though when I met God I only felt love and goodness, God is both good and evil.

I hope you all enjoyed my report.  Even after 50 trips and several years I still feel like a rookie looking to veterans on the internet for advice.  I still have no idea what the hell DMT is.  I still have no idea if where I go is just in my head or if it actually exists out there somewhere.  I am sill just as confused as the first time I ever heard of DMT.  Cheers!"

"The first time I died
Death is only a transfer. One form, one vessel, one dimension, to another. There is no beginning, and there is no end. I finally truly understand, for the first time in my life. A truth I could never have known without the benefit of first experiencing death. That life is a wondrous, beautiful, colorful, magical accident. To be here, alive with consciousness, is an ineffable, dizzying, circumstantial twist of dimensional fate. 

The day I died began as any other, and ended like no other....

As this world began to fade away, my eyes gently began to glaze. The room around me began to peel, the furniture began to reveal its true molecular form, its particles rising to the ceiling as one, like an orchestral crescendo. 

And just like that, I was no longer in this world, I could no longer feel my physical body. I became pure energy. I could feel and see energy vibrating everywhere, rising from every object as if it were a whispery billow of smoke. Everything was represented by color, not form. The stage became serpent, slithery, and filled with indescribable pulsating luminance. 

Suddenly, everything in my field of vision flashed white. I was inhabiting a blank canvas, but it was also full of unspoken meaning and spirit. I could hear thousands of low frequency murmurings, the same way a large crowd sounds in muted anticipation of a main event. I could feel nothing but purity and unconditional love. Real unconditional love, far greater and deeper than we are capable of experiencing as human beings. I was being embraced. 

This place I found myself in... It was its own space, it’s own dimension. When I entered, I completely forgot who I was, what I was. I had no memory of the life I’d lived, or my physical body. I was only pure essence, existing in a dimension where only energy and the highest of consciousness can live. It was equal parts scary, and stunningly perfect. It was terrifying to leave my body, my memories, my humanity behind. However, the ability to let go remains the most liberatingly beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced. 

As the life that I once knew drifted away, like a dandelion floret on a soft zephyr, I realized how much unnecessary baggage and emotion I had carried in my life, and how much it had held me back from not only being happy, but from maximizing my potential. 

Imagine walking a hiking trail, and every hundred meters we add a 10kg weight to our backpack. After a kilometer, you may still be able to hike the path, but you are strained, twisted and bitter. At this point, you are no longer enjoying the hike. You are not witnessing the beauty of nature unfolding around you... This is what I was shown. What I felt. 

As quickly as I had been catapulted into the white dimension, I found myself hurtling down a tunnel towards another. The walls of this tunnel were inscribed with various forms of language and symbolism. Some of it appeared to be hieroglyphics, but I had absolutely no point of reference to compare it to. What I did know was that it was ancient, it carried great wisdom, and it seemed of the utmost importance. It showed our past. Our evolution. Our achievements.

As I finished gliding through this tunnel of human knowledge and history, I landed in a room without walls, a room that seemed infinite. Unlike the previous dimension, which seemed like some kind of waiting area for souls, the background was black rather than white. Very slowly and deliberately manifesting in the distance of this dimension, was a magnetic, captivating, shape-shifting creature. It moved towards me with a sense of purpose. Its movements were like water, a continuous slithery unfolding of shapes and color... Colors that have yet to be invented, or even imagined. These shapes and colors would evolve and retract, twist and turn, sway and recede. It almost looked like a tumbling, kaleidoscopic octopus. The more I watched the random, rolling movements of this entity, the more rhythm and patterned consistency it displayed. It was like a machine... An organic machine. It was very interested in me. It was curious. It knew me. I could sense its familiarity with me. And somehow, I knew it too. It was inviting me into the dimension, and I found myself deeply wanting to go there. 

The thing that struck me most about this creature was it’s dignity. It’s aura. It’s self-awareness. It’s power. It’s majesty. It absolutely radiated with energy. Just being in its presence inspired awe. Inspired love. That incomparable level of unconditional love I spoke of earlier. You could feel it’s importance. You could feel it’s intelligence. Without directly communicating with me through language, it was telepathically sending me an undeniable message that it was indeed the center. The source. The beginning of everything we have ever known. I believe to my core that I was in the company of God... It left me with no doubt. 

Just as I began to surrender myself to this entity, to God, the darkness in this space transformed to a faded shade of purple. The purple then faded to pink, as did The Source. It slowly moved away from me, in the reverse pattern from which it had approached. It was all disappearing before my eyes. I tried desperately to focus all of my thoughts and energy, in a last ditch effort to stay there. It was all to no avail. The faded, foggy pink lifted to reveal a washed version of the original, Earthly room from which my journey began. 

Innately, I knew I wasn’t all the way back. I felt trapped between two worlds, but I could feel my body, I could control my motor functions. I felt human once again. I looked around the room, everything around my field of vision took on a greenish hue, particularly around the edges. Then, on the left side of my vision, I saw a shape rise. It started out as a small ball of dark matter, then grew taller and more oval in shape. It then raised even further, and a head began to form. It became abundantly clear that it was a man. I knew instantly who this man was. I smiled and thanked my late Father for being with me. 

“I miss you terribly, every single day. It’s not getting easier.”

My eyes filled with tears, and a lightning bolt of blues, greens and pinks went shooting across my field of vision. I was filled with a sensation of love and security. My hair tingled, in exactly the place his fingers used to stroke my head when I was a child. When we shared the same world. It was all the reassurance I needed. It would all be ok. Anytime I like, I could channel his spirit, and he would be there. I would be there. We would all be there. It all makes such beautiful sense.....

I’m still unsure how to categorize this experience. After such an ethereal, mystical journey one would think I would approach my life with new purpose and vigor. However, I’ve struggled mightily with my reintegration to humanity. I suppose in a way that I’m grieving for the loss of my innocence, my former life. In retrospect it seemed so simple. 

I’m trying to work through it all, on a daily basis, but it’s so confusing. In some ways, the other side is so much more pure, beautiful, serene and egalitarian than this world. There is no pain, there is no regret. There is no suffering. There is no greed or materialism. There is only love, acceptance and freedom. However, I have my wife and children in this world, and an existence without them could never be worth even the highest of spiritual ascents. 

I’m finding that I feel extremely isolated since my return. Misunderstood. The things in my life that used to drive me, excite me, no longer have the same depth of meaning. Conversely, I feel like the things that currently drive humanity forward are the same things that destroy us. Money. Technology. Politics. Career. Secrets. War. 

This feeling of alienation will pass, I have faith in that. I guess I just need time to process things. My biggest takeaway is that life is our spiritual gift from the Universe to further our journey of learning. To give us the spiritual lessons we need to reach our ultimate enlightenment. Everything we see, touch, taste and experience... Every single person we love, loathe and interact with... This Earth, everyone, and everything... It’s all here for us. This world, our lives, will give us exactly what we need.
