"DMT breakthrough wasn't like anything I expected or read about, I re-experienced my birth and life.
A buddy of mine was kind enough to provide me with a DMT crash course. We both thought it would be good to increment doses as 5mg -> 15mg -> 22mg -> 30mg.  
His vape setup was super efficient, I don't think I wasted anything.  
  
  
**5mg**  
Not much to say here, it was just like activating HD vision and sort of like being in the peak of a very very light mushroom trip.  
  
  
**15mg**  
This one shook me up, and it was kind of what I had expected from DMT. It hit hard and fast, and I hardly knew what was going on. My eyes were wide open which was probably the cause of my discomfort, because instead of the trip manifesting out of the blackness on the inside of my eyelids, the room I was in started to break apart and become this impossible object that the trip was insistent that I look at.  
  
If I ever had a thought like ""what IS this?"" or ""how am I going to explain this when I'm down??"" I would get this feeling like someone was telling me ""no-no..."" and ""watch...""  
and the object would re-assemble, snap back into place locked in my vision, and move in impossible ways.  
  
The place I was felt like a classroom, and I was supposed to be doing something, probably paying attention to the teacher...  
  
  
**22mg**  
Here I made sure I that relaxed and closed my eyes, and the trip was much much more pleasant. There were two entities, a mother and father figure, who were controlling these sets of wheels that were opening the background of the setting.  
  
Much like my experience in the 'classroom' trip, any time I had a thought that wasn't pure acceptance and surrender to the trip, the background would start to close up and I'd 'lose progress' and I would be reminded to pay attention/let go. Except this time it was put much more bluntly in the form of a shoe literally knocking my thought out of the trip.  
  
The trip ended before the background could fully open up, and the comedown was spent slowly riding a purple tunnel lined with faces and geometric patterns.  
I had the overwhelming sensation of being born again.  
  
  
**30mg breakthrough yippee**  
This was unlike anything I had expected. There were no patterns or fractal geometry, no entities, nothing. I had taken the dose in two big hits, and midway through the second hit it was as if someone had pressed the pause button on this reality. Everything broke apart, I had this feeling like my whole life was just this convoluted game and everything had led up to me taking DMT, and now the game was over.  
  
I had reverted back through my entire life until there was nothing but blackness. I was here in this black limbo for awhile when I heard/felt the presence of a female entity that was comforting me, telling me this is how it's always been, I just hadn't seen it before. I was aware of how I was everyone and everything, I felt like I had experienced this moment infinite times before.  
  
After an indeterminate subjective time, the brightest light emerged from the darkness and I realized I was a baby. I felt myself in a baby's physical form... it was so real. At that point I had started to quickly re-live my own life, while also flowing into the lives of my mom, dad, and brothers. I was shown that this whole thing is just 'me' as in, the REAL me. I've been here forever and all that matters in this existence is the love we share for ourselves and the bonds that we create within this reality.  
  
I was so surprised when I came back to reality, because I had been 100% convinced the life I had known was over, and I was going to re-experience everything again with my memory wiped clean. I couldn't believe that I was back, I remember asking my trip sitter if I was back, but I was still in the 'one-ness' mode of thinking that I thought he was just me telling me that I've always been here. This feeling was shaken about 15 seconds after asking and I was back in my ego-self.  
  
I don't know if what I experienced was 'real', but we don't even know what's going on at all or what 'real' even means. So I'm taking the message that I got in that space to heart. It's easy to understand on an intellectual level that we are one, but it's another thing to EXPERIENCE it. I'm convinced that this reality is just here so that 'god' can experience love within itself through the fragmentation of itself in the form of all these egos.  
  
I'm taking this message to heart, and I'll make it my effort to make sure my friends and family are happy, and that I'm taking time to make this world a better place. It sounds so cliche and I always feel a little funny talking about stuff like this, but love is really all that matters in this life. I can't let myself get caught up in the bullshit and stresses such as school/work... that stuff is important, but I need to make sure I'm tending to what really matters also, it's easy to forget in our society...

"I did something everyone advises against. I smoked DMT while I was suicidal depressed and I did it without a trip sitter.
I did this three nights ago. I was very upset. I was seriously contemplating suicide. Then I told myself, ""Well, smoking DMT felt a lot like dying. Why not just smoke some instead of doing something stupid?""  
  
So, I took one of my gpen vaporizers and loaded. 0.05 grams in it. I took one big puff and I was instantly in the waiting room. I was there for what felt like 20 minutes but was probably more like 3 minutes.  
  
I took another puff at was glued to my bed for another what felt like 20 minutes.  
  
I only got some mild visuals. Never got any out of body sensations. Never made it to the other side. Only glazed the surface.  
  
I waited about an hour and then I loaded my vapor genie with about the same amount. I hit it a few times then didn't really experience much. 
  
I decided to call it a night. I had to brush my teeth because my mouth tasted and smelled like dead bodies.  
  
Then tonight at work. A girl I work with invited me out to have drinks with her. We drank and talked to each other for about three hours then when it was time for last call she paid for all my drinks and gave me a big hug and told me she loved me.  
  
I went from wanting to kill myself to having a beautiful young lady I work with invite me out for drinks, pay my tab, and tell me she loves me.   
  
I guess you could say I'm glad I chose DMT over suicide. Otherwise tonight would have never happened and I've have never known this girl wanted me to know she loves me.",1

I expect many people not to believe in this story I am going to share and I completely understand that - even though I am going to describe my own experience, even me myself can barely believe what happened.

Half a year ago I was suffering from severe depression - every day waking up with thoughts about how I suck, how my life sucks and how the world sucks. To give you a little context, I'll say that my life did not suck form an objective point of view. I was a physically healthy individual, 22 years old, had many colleages and couple of really close friends, working out at the gym, playing the guitar, had a job that I loved and was earning better than most of my peers etc. There were really only some minor things that could be better at that time, but generally my life was pretty amazing. But despite all of that, 95&#37; of my thoughts were negative and pessimistic. It probably has something to do with my family - alcoholic father and borderline mother. I never really connected with them and entering the adulthood, I realised that my family was far from normal. Also, I do not recall being praised for one thing I have done in my childhood. Everything I did was done bad, nothing was good enough. So I started to have negative thoughts about it - if my family wasn't healthy, then there are surely some consequences in my psyche, I am surely worse than my peers, I won't be able to create healthy family myself etc. I could write an essay about different type of negative thoughts that my mind created. So at some point, even though I had evidence in the outside world that I am doing pretty good, I had negative thoughts about every single little thing. At the same time, I knew that these thoughts were inaccurate, so this was another reason to think that there is something wrong with me and my mind. Perfect example of closed loop of negative thinking.

I went to psychatrist and I think he did his job OK trying do help me, but I don't know if it was too late or what, but it did not really help me and after that, I was certain that there is nothing that can help me.

I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was 14, then from the age of 18 I was regularly thinking about it in my worst moments, but never was really close to actually doing it. But having these awful thoughts every single day, every waking hour, around half a year ago I decided that this is too much and only ending my life will give me a relief. So I planned my suicide. I've chosen the method, I've written my suicide notes to all of  the closest people in my life, I've written my will. I had every little detail of it planned. The only thing I was waiting for was the date I chose to be my last day. It was a couple of weeks after the time I made my decision, because my close family member was having a wedding and I didn't want to ruin this event by killing myself shortly before that. So I was just waiting.

Making that decision was already a big relief. Knowing that this whole thing will end made me somehow calm. Before that, when I entered the loop of negative thinking, it was very harsh and I was asking myself ""What can I do to stop this, to not hear these terrible thoughts ALL THE FUCKING TIME?"" - but the answer wasn't coming.  Until it came and it happened to be ""Kill myself"". Maybe it wasn't the greatest solution, but it was some solution that I knew I can do to stop experiencing these thoughts and it will work out.

By the way, it's interesting how things you do can seem different when you know you are doing them for the last time. Last clothes shopping, my last bicycle ride, my last gym workout etc.  It feels almost like done for the first time. You start noticing little details about those activities when you try to enjoy them for the last time in your life.

In the meantime, my friend with whom I have smoked marijuana, taken LSD and MDMA, and with whom I have been talking about smoking DMT, aquired it and we had set up a meeting to do it. I was happy knowing that I will have one more very interesting experience before I exit this world. So, we had the lighter, the glass pipe and DMT. Anything missing? Ahh, right - the scale. We did have the scale, but with precision of 0.01g. So when it pointed 0.03g it could be 25-35mg, or even beyond those values (it was the cheapest scale you can buy, and the only one we had). But we were too excited to try DMT to wait another couple of days to order a proper scale, so we just went with it. I was the first one who tried it. So, wanting to be safe and reasonable, I took \~20mg into the pipe and tried to vape it. As it turned out, you have to develop good technique of lighting it to really take use of all of the spice that you loaded into the pipe. Plus, I think it was really less than 20mg. So when I finished smoking it, I felt a little dizzy, seen some visuals and everything sounded a bit different, but apart from that, nothing really happened.  Pretty much a mediocre (100ug) LSD trip for 10 minutes. I was really dissapointed. I started reading about tolerance and after quick research I decided to try again in an hour. In the meantime, my friend did it. I don't know if he did breakthrough or not, but he definitely has gone further than me - he was just laying on the bed with his eyes closed and spoke only few words throughout the whole experience (around 10 mins). He was pretty satisfied with the experience.

So, an hour has gone by and it was my turn to try again. I was pretty frustrated, because I wanted to see what this whole DMT thing is about and I knew that there might not be another occassion before my planned date of commiting suicide where me and this friend can meet up with no one else interrupting, so at that point I was very aggresive with the dosing.

And that, possibly, saved my life.

I measured 40mg on the scale, and there was some left in the pipe, so I guess that I had over 50mg loaded for my first real DMT trip (not counting that 10 mins like-LSD one an hour earlier). My friend started heating the pipe, and when the smoke started to arise, I took a HUGE hit, constantly sucking the pipe for about 30-40 seconds until I passed out. So basically I took as much as my body was able to take before passing out.

The last thing I remember is that I started to hear that very loud noise and I saw not one, but two pipes in front of me, then three, then four... Then I lied on the bed and took a deep breath, because I remember being scared that I won't be able to breathe after taking that huge hit. Then I closed my eyes, saw some visuals for maybe 2 seconds.

What happened later is indescribable. I was completely blasted out of my body and my ego. The only thing that I remember and that I can describe, is that I saw no fractals, just my whole vision was flickering black and red colors, and heard that screeching noise. I woke up, still completely high. The first thing I did was looking at my watch and the hands were going in the opposite direction at an incredible speed. Now I know, that I wanted to ask how much time has passed since I smoked, so my first spoken words were ""How much time..."" - but then I realised that I don't remember what happened (that I smoked DMT) so I didn't know how to finish that question, but secondly, and more importantly, at that point I didn't exactly know what time was. I had no memory of who or where I am. I was looking at the room around me trying to figure out what was happening, and by ""what"" I mean the world. It took me a while to get the concept of time, to realise that I am a human being on the planet Earth, that I have an identity, a first and last name and that I am at my friend's place.

As I later found out, I woke up after around 4 minutes after smoking, sat on the bed put my hands on my face, and for another 10 minutes I was only saying thing like ""Wait, what...?"" and ""What the fuck just happened?"". Those 4 minutes truly felt eternal for me. I felt like I was dying and being born thousands of times. I was beyond time and matter and had no sense of identity whatsoever. I definitely felt this common thing like I was ""at home"", that I have already been there and that I will go there again. No words can explain it, but it was by far the strangest experience of my life.

Later that night, we went to another friend's place, we were drinking some beers, playing video games - just an usual evening and I was able to behave completely normal. Only when I had a second to think, I went back to this moment in my mind and was completely shocked about what happened and how I felt. This shock was present for around 24 hours. 2 days after the experience, at the end of the day, I sat on the bed in my room, alone. This was normally the time, when the negative thoughts would arise. And then, it happened.

Silence.

At first I did not believe what was happening. I did not consider it is possible. But that glorious silence was real as hell! 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes of pure silcence in my head. No thoughts. Just peace of mind. I started smiling, shaking my head, crying, jumping on the bed, laughing histerically, crying again. I was free. It felt so different, like I was born again. Like someone pulled my brain out of my head, removed all the toxins, cleaned and oiled it well and put it back inside. I still remember all the experiences I had throughout my life, but inside I am a completely different person. Born again - that's the best way I can describe it.

And there I am today, happy with my life as ever. Or maybe truly happy for the first time.

I am 100&#37; percent sure that I would have killed myself. I am not afraid of dying, nor I am afraid of doing risky things. I was certain that, because of my mental state, I didn't want to live anymore, I had the perfect plan and the balls to do it. But then that happened.

What I had could probably be classified as some mental illness (depression, but probably something else as well) and that single trip cured it. There is no other circumstance in my life that has changed. It's not that I started meeting with people, working out, in the meantime I smoked DMT, my psyche improved so I gave credit to the drug for it. No, I had everything I could want in life and still felt like shit. Until that single trip. I have not tripped since then, because I feel no need for it. Maybe I will do it in the future (with a proper scale, that's for sure :D), out of curiosity how ""usual"" DMT trip feels like, because I did not really see anything or had contact with any entities. But for now, for the first time in my life I feel like I don't need to do anything to be happy. I'm happy just like that. Maybe it's nothing special for a normal person, but it's something incredible for me.

This friend I smoked with, after I shared this whole story with him, came up with an explenation that for 4 minutes I lost myself, that made me appreciate myself as a person and that's why those suicidal thoughts disappeared. I must admit that it seems pretty accurate.

Would I recommend anybody in my situation doing what I did? Well, that's a tough question. The experience was so intense that I can see a lot of people having mental breakdown because of it. If someone is feeling suicidal, they need to go to psychiatrist first. It didn't help me, but I know that it can help and it helped a lot of people. But if you're 100&#37; sure you are going to commit suicide, like I was, I'd say smoke a lot of DMT and see what happens. You've got nothing to lose,

right?

I personally did not treat this like a medicine for my state in any way. I have already been into psychedelics before and I just wanted to have a mindblowing experience. I did not expect this to help me whatsoever. Luckily, I guess you don't always get what you expect. I heard that DMT is going to give you the trip you need, not the trip you want. It turned out to be true as hell for me.

As I wrote this, I smiled and cried many times. The whole thing seems unbelievable, even to myself and even after thinking about it dozens of times. But it's not the part that I wanted to kill myself that makes me so emotional. I had suicide thoughts for such a long time that they feel as natural as eating or sleeping to me. It's what happened with my brain after the trip that blows my mind. Also, I get shivers when I think about the experience itself and coming back to life shortly after it. I recently found the pipe that I used that time while cleaning my room. I sniffed it, felt the smell of the spice and instatly got shivers all over my body, my eyes closed by themselves and my whole body became stiff. The memory of the experience is as strong as it can possibly be.

I'm glad that there is a place in the Internet where I can share this experience with the world, because there are not many people in my life that I can talk about this with. It's not that I don't have friends - they just wouldn't understand it. I am not surprised, because me myself barely understand it. I am just lucky to still be living right now. If I'd just change my mind about a suicide, I might have been alive now, but certainly still depressed. I'm 100&#37; sure that thanks to DMT I am alive and truly happy.",1

"Advice for people who want to try DMT.
I would like to explain some things that I have learned from the **DMT** experience (I tried it for the first time exactly 1 year ago from today). I have done it many times over the course of the year.

To begin, **DMT** is not be taken lightly. It is some serious medicine. When I am saying serious like I really mean it, the human language cannot be used to describe this mind-blowing experience. This experience is not for everyone. **DMT** is not a medicine like Marijuana where you take a few puffs and then you relax on the couch smiling. 

The **DMT** experience does not compare to any other psychedelic, it is entirely something else. LSD & Shrooms do not compare on any level to **DMT**. I wouldn't even call **DMT** ""tripping"".

When people report that they encounter beings/entities from other dimensions, they are not joking. The most interesting part about it is that the entities are excited to see you. They're extremely happy that you have discovered **DMT**. In fact when I was doing research about **DMT** before I tried it, I thought it was all a troll. I thought people were over exaggerating their experience. I thought they were trying to sound cool and interesting but boy was I wrong? 

I understand that **DMT** users sound crazy to people who have never tried it. This experience can only be understood once you have experienced it, there is no other way. It is impossible for the human mind to imagine what **DMT** is like without trying it. As for a personal truth, I have come to the conclusion that based on what I have seen on **DMT**, my brain does not have the capacity to generate what I have seen. I personally believe that my consciousness did leave this dimension during my last breakthrough. 

**To anyone who wants to try it, this is my advice:**

* Do lots of research and learn about this molecule. Learn about the risks and rewards. DMT is not known to make a normal person go mentally-ill. Psychedelics will only make you go crazy if you are already a mentally-ill person. If you or your family has any history of mental disorder I would not continue.

* No one is ever ready for DMT, even users that are very experienced. Use it as a tool to explore your mind. DMT is not known to be addictive. I personally believe it is the most non-addictive drug. If you abuse this beautiful molecule, you will pay the psychological consequences.

* Buckle your seat belt because it will feel like you're going to school. You're going somewhere to learn things about yourself and your consciousness. Every time I do it I feel like a kid and those entities are my teachers.

* Start with a low dose. Keep in mind that some people say you need 40mg-50mg to breakthrough but I disagree. I have broke-through on 25mg with efficient vaporization. You also have to remember that other people have a different purity level of their product and their product might be less pure so they need more to breakthrough. I would recommend starting 10mg-15mg to see what you're dealing with. Be prepared for your mind to be blown even on low doses. When I smoked 10mg my first time, my room looked more real than real. Squares were more squarer, my TV was more rectangle than rectangle. Perfect geometry razor sharp straight lines. The texture of our current reality went from 720p to 4K (I am not exaggerating).

* If at any point it seems like you are thinking more about the DMT world and less about this world I would recommend to take a long break. If you are starting to feel negative psychological effects, you need to quit altogether. Psychological addiction can ruin your life, it does not have to be drugs. It can be gambling, food, sex, etc. 

* Lastly, just remember that there is a 99.9% chance that you will question everything after the experience is over. Who you are, the reality that you have accepted this whole time, all that you know. I think this is a good way for a person to think, to question things. In my opinion in the end, it's all about perspective.

**The conclusion of my experiences:**

* Even though every DMT trip is different, I feel that every time I do it I come back to the same conclusion. That I am simply an illusion. When I had my breakthrough, thats what it's like when the illusion of self ends. Except when you die for real you don't have a body to come back to. That is what the DMT experience always tells me: **That it's all an illusion.**

**Safe Journeys friends.**

"A/B DMT Extraction 'Tek'
I've had a few requests to write up an outline &amp; summary of the method I've been using to extract spice, that I've adapted over time &amp; thru plenty of trials and errors. I'm by no means a trained chemist, I didn't even take basic chemistry back in high school. But I've put in quite a bit of time researching, understanding, and learning the process and the chemistry behind it. I believe it's the easiest, most straightforward, and most effective way to achieve top notch results - in the shortest amount of time &amp; with the least amount of effort required. I'm more than happy to share what I've learned throughout the past year, so here it is! I'll try to explain each step as much as possible. I personally never measure anything, as I believe that ratios do not need to be exact, but reasonably close is always good. I typically extract from  1kg of MHRB at a time, but I split it into two separate 500g extractions. For the sake of this 'tek' I'll pretend I'm just extracting from 500g to make things easy. It can be scaled up or down as needed, as it is a very forgiving procedure for the most part. If you're new to the game, start with 50-100 grams of MHRB just to get properly acquainted. Smaller extractions always go more smoothly, and larger ones can get a bit tricky sometimes. 

Take your time, don't rush or lose patience, and everything will be all good. If something goes wrong at some point, **never** dump or throw anything away. 99/100 times nothing is actually fucked up.

Anyway, here it is!


**Materials &amp; equipment that I use:**

10ml Pipettor - I use a Gilson P10MLG. It's my baby. The cheaper green 10ml pipettors with the thumbwheel also work **amazingly** well for extracting. Buy one of those to start with. No bullshit. A legit pipettor is the one thing I'd never want to be missing during an extraction.

2000ml Corning Pyrex Erlenmeyer Flask ($20 or so, just do yourself a favor)

250ml &amp; 100ml Pyrex Beakers

Large stainless steel pot

Funnel

Hotplate

Cordless drill with drywall mud mixer (blades cut down to fit into the erlenmeyer)

Heat gun / hairdryer

Heptane (VM&amp;P naphtha works as well)

Sodium Hydroxide (Lye)

Shredded MHRB (I avoid powdered bark like the plague, although it works)

Distilled Water

5% Distilled White Vinegar



**The procedure:**




The whole point of an acid/base extraction is to transfer the spice out of the MHRB and into an acidic solution before actually extracting it. This step is literally what makes an A/B superior to any STB in several ways, and despite it being an extra step compared to STB it saves a ton of time in the long run. 

I take 500g of MHRB and throw it all into a large stainless pot, and fill it with enough distilled water so that it's just covering all of the MHRB. Then i add about 100ml of vinegar to the pot as well. This creates DMT acetate, which is water soluble and allows the spice to transfer over to the water. It then goes on a hot plate or stove burner and is  heated while stirring and agitating until the water starts to boil. After about 10-15 minutes or so of boiling, i cut the heat and let it cool for 10-15 minutes while continuing to stir. I carefully pour the liquid thru a funnel into a 2L erlenmeyer flask, while making sure the mhrb stays behind in the pot. The liquid should be a dark reddish color. Then I repeat this step 2 more times, adding fresh distilled water and vinegar each time. After each session of boiling and cooling and stirring, I pour off the liquid into the same erlenmeyer flask, so that the total liquid from all 3 times is now combined. I found that 3 times is sufficient to get all of the spice out of the bark. The MHRB will usually turn somewhat dull looking in appearance as it gets exhausted of its alkaloid content, and is no longer needed. I set it aside (just in case) and am left with my erlenmeyer flask which contains all of the liquid from the acid boils at this point. 

The ideal thing to do is to boil off much of the water and reduce the volume of the solution to about 25% or in other words boil it down to about 400ml. That way it only takes a fraction of NaOH needed to sufficiently freebase the spice. However, I tend to not do this as it's much easier to pull my NPS from the narrow neck of the erlenmeyer than it is from the base. A/B requires much less NaOH than STB by nature anyway so I don't mind this. Either way, I make sure it's cooled to room temp as a safety precaution, because the next step generates a fuck-ton of heat as it is.

**Safety notice: be EXTREMELY FUCKING CAREFUL WITH LYE!! As long as you fully respect it and exercise caution, you'll be fine. HOWEVER, it literally melts flesh upon contact and WILL cause blindness if splashed into the eyes due to negligence.. Pour it in slowly while steadily stirring! And please don't be using pickle jars and shit like that. I've been there, and I don't recommend it. Even Mason jars are sketchy AF and prone to breaking due to sudden/extreme temperature change!** Anyway, I then pour in a decent amount (100g or so?) of NaOH into the acidic solution and the magic starts to visibly happen immediately. I stick my drill into the mix and let it rip until it goes through it's crazy reaction and eventually turns black. The DMT has turned from an acetate salt form, to freebase DMT. It is now insoluble in water, and soluble in nonpolar solvent. Basically it's solubility has reversed.. The solution is hot as a MF by this point, so I let it cool for about a half hour, or at least until the outside of the erlenmeyer flask is no more than warm when I wrap my hand around it. More heat increases spice's solubility in non polar solvent, but it also pulls impurities & plant oils and fats which is my top concern. Spice is more than plenty soluble in NPS without needing any external heat.

Note: NaOH (lye) is insoluble in nonpolar solvent. As long as you let the layers completely separate in the next step, the NaOH will remain in the aqueous (bottom) layer. Just make sure it stays there & you'll have no reason to worry..

Now that I've got my aqueous solution of freebased spice cooled down, it's ready to be extracted. This is where things may seem a bit unconventional, but I swear by it. I pour in a bunch of heptane. Probably upwards of 400ml or so. I do big pulls, but I also only do two pulls. Once I have poured in my nonpolar solvent, I stick my drill back in & mix the unholy fuck out of it. After a minute or two, I put a stopper in the mouth of the flask and shake it as hard and as violently as I possibly can for a minute or two. Then I take my pipettor and draw up as much NPS from the flask as it will hold, and immediately *spray* it straight down & right back into the mix. Over and over and over for a few minutes. 

The real beauty of an A/B, is that there's no plant matter to cause any emulsions, so I literally never see such a thing. If by chance it does want to emulsify, I pour in a bit more NaOH and mix the shit out of it out of it some more. If it's got a high enough pH level, the two layers will be 100% separated within 10 minutes at the most. Complete separation is the most important factor in getting pure white crystals. In between the layers should be glassy smooth before pulling the NPS, with no bubbles or anything like that. Also, by doing an A/B there's no plant matter to absorb or steal any NPS, so there's no loss to any sludge. There's also no plant matter to contaminate the end product, so it's a win-win-win-win situation. It's next level compared to STB. No comparison, really.

Once things are separated, my NPS is usually already cloudy from being so saturated with spice. This is why I mix and shake it so hard. I pull the NPS (there's no need to get it all on the first pull) out with my pipettor and transfer it into a beaker, then put it on a hotplate (no flames!) to **gently** boil it down & reduce the volume. I hit it with either a heat gun or hair dryer at the same time, which makes the level drop pretty quickly. The solvent should remain just *barely* boiling **at most** for the entire time, to avoid losing any spice. I like to reduce it until the NPS is pretty much milky white and opaque at room temp, or even while still warm. The more saturated, the better. It decreases the time needed to freeze precipitate and also forces more to crash out in the freezer. 

Note: I prefer to use n-heptane over naptha based on the increased solubility and shorter evaporation time, so naptha may not get quite as cloudy as what I described.

When I feel like it's saturated enough, I put some plastic wrap over the top and stick it in the freezer, still in the same beaker. I find that it's much easier to collect and manage when it's in a beaker, rather than dicking around with some big tray or dish. 2-3 hours in the freezer is all it takes doing it this way, tops. I can tell when it's ready to come out by the NPS being completely clear once again. I take it out of the freezer and immediately dump the NPS right back into the erlenmeyer flask to be reused. The beaker containing the spice is set aside to dry. I whip out my drill and mix it up again, then shake the contents of the flask again, spraying the NPS back into it with my pipettor again, then let it settle. 10 mins later when it's separated, I pull the NPS and transfer it into another beaker before reducing the volume and freezing and basically repeating the process. You can always combine the pulls and freeze them together, however I'm an impatient bastard and I like to see what each pull yields separately.

From a 500g extraction I usually only end up doing 2 good sized back to back pulls, and each one will typically yield 3-4 grams of snow white crystals. Another advantage of A/B is that instead of the time it takes for the NaOH to completely lyse and break down the MHRB cells to 'let the spice out' during a STB, it's all available to be pulled immediately so it can all be pulled right away with no waiting. I can't speak highly enough for how much better and easier it is than STB. When I first started I saw people always recommending A/B but I was intimidated by it and didn't understand the significance of the extra step at the beginning. It's definitely a game changer tho, and is the only way to go imho. Recrystallization is never needed.


This whole process takes a matter of hours from start to finish. I can start it when I get home after work on a weekday, and by the time I go to bed that night I'll have at least 7g of clean DMT from a 500g extraction. Or least a half ounce if I start with 1kg MHRB.  Ready to vape. And still have time to clean up, shower, eat, dab, etc.

The same quality of results can be obtained via STB without recrystallization, but it turns into a matter of 2-3 days instead, and is a messy sludgey pain in the ass in comparison.



So there it is! It was written up pretty quickly and for that I apologize, but hopefully it makes sense and hopefully it helps some of my fellow blastronauts streamline  and improve their methods of obtaining this magical gift. I'll always be happy to answer any questions, sometimes PMs get buried and I miss them but I'll do my best to help anyone out. 

Happy Travels!

My preferred method of vaping - hot rails (thru the nostril). By far, hands down. More intense than any other method, and beyond simple. No taste, no harshness. It's the only method that still scares me everytime simply because of how effective it really is. https://youtu.be/CXab7fNjdu4  https://youtu.be/VPW45St0yoE


**Edit; if you have powdered bark rather than shredded,** one of the commenters has pointed out that he secures his powdered bark within a cotton cloth, and soaks/boils in the acidic solution 3x for about an hour each. Like a big ass (or however you scale it) mhrb teabag He said he's had good results going it that way. I don't recommend boiling loose powdered bark by any means, it's a monstrous pain in the ass and is nearly impossible to strain/filter out all of the powdered bark from the solution.

"Took DMT and acid, had sex, ended up conceiving after a year of no luck.
I've been meaning to post this for a while because it's absolutely insane to me, but basically after about 5 times of doing DMT in a few month period, boyfriend and I decide to take acid and smoke DMT. (Note; we had been trying to conceive for about a year before because I had believed I could not get pregnant and therefore it wouldn't hurt to try.) On that night (3/8/17) we had taken the acid around 1 or 2am, then we watched Futurama and smoked weed until we both decided we wanted to smoke DMT since we had already peaked. We both sat there for about 30 minutes just staring at it, neither of us wanting to go first, waiting for the other to go first to kick it off. Then finally I said fuck it, I'll go first because I always do and to just jump. As he heated up the rig, I was a little bit more afraid/anxious than usual because I knew the acid would enhance the trip, but I calmed myself and knew it would just feel even more amazing than usual. Took my hit, held it in for about 5-10 seconds then blew it out, as soon as I smelled the smoke  I had just exhaled, I knew I was about to fucking be gone. Trip begins normally, taking me back to the different places I always go on DMT, the most bizarre but familiar feelings I have had. I see my soul and then all of a sudden I'm in a black void, with out a body, no solids as far as I can see. Then I see a sort of cluster of light emitting ribbons, there were about 10,000 or so, they were not taking up too much space in the black void. They all seemed to weave around each other, doing this beautiful dance without touching the others, yet they were also a part of one ""body"". Then I realized I was one of them, and I had an absolutely overwhelming sense of euphoria and peace and love and togetherness and unity. I remember thinking repeatedly who am I if I have no feelings or wants? Who am I if I have no feelings or wants? It was confusing but it felt so right I didn't try to over analyze it. Then I just was, there was no me, no I, no thoughts, I simply was. It was the most peaceful event I have experienced in my 20 years of life. Then I remember needing to lay down to just enjoy it, and as I laid down, I was taken through space and then I remember seeing my boyfriend looking at me kind of concerned and worried. And I remember having the feeling of wanting to be intimate, cuddle, sex, squeeze, whatever. He says I waved my hand at his crotch and he instantly got an erection (like magic or some crazy shit). And-then I reached out to him, grabbing on to his t shirt and pulled him on top of me and just held him and caressed him with much intensity, I felt amazing. I guess I began sort of grinding my hips in to him and he asked if I wanted to have sex, he seemed hesitant and worried, but was like okay?? And then we had sex and it was the most crazy, beautiful, pleasurable experience I have ever ever ever experienced. I remember just looking around, actually turning my head, and not knowing what to say besides ""Wow, it's so beautiful."" And it was just the best feeling in the world and I remember moaning ridiculously loud, but also just not caring at all because I fucking felt amazing. And then we finished and I sat in disbelief, thinking wow this is the sex people should be having! And during the trip, I saw myself laying facedown, and instead of my bed, I was on top of rock, sort of like cave material. And I saw myself from his perspective, the back of my head, but I had a headdress on, like one an Egyptian pharaoh would have, the beautiful Egyptian blue and gold colors. And after we had finished, he said he had seen the same thing? Like I somehow sent my trip visions to him telepathically or something. He had not smoked DMT, he was just on acid when that happened so I thought that was kind of crazy and weird. Then he took his DMT and I watched him, trying to remember exactly what had just happened, but disappointingly, not being able to recall all of it. When he was finished tripping it was around 6am and we just turned off the lights and tried to go to sleep. Fast forward, about a month later, began peeing a lot and breasts were sore. I instantly KNEW I was pregnant, so that night I bought a 2pk pregnancy test and the next morning I raced to the bathroom and did my thing, then in about 30 seconds (it didn't even take the whole 2 minutes) I read ""pregnant"" in the clear black font. I recalled that night about a month earlier and kinda just shook my head in amazement, I didn't even think I could get pregnant, and then I took that acid and DMT and somehow manipulated my boyfriend'a penis to get an erection in 1 second and we conceived that night. And I remember the DMT gods, looking down at us, as if they were observing to make sure we were doing everything right and I had an overwhelming feeling of approval and I had immediate assurance that I was doing exactly what I should be doing at exactly the right time. Now, I'm 33 weeks pregnant, due December 7th. Every day I look back at that day and try to comprehend it, but I never can and I accept that but I still thank the DMT gods every day for letting me experience that. ",1

I was immediately shot out like a cannon from my body into a place I can't even describe in words.. It was pure unimaginable beauty and I was racing through it at incredible speeds, millions of entities would pass by as I zipped through the universe. I was stripped of all my humanity and eventually I was just a spirit or observer who had no memory of this world. 

Eventually it all slowed down and I was in like a castle or a cathedral and there was this wise ancient man who reminded me a lot of Gandalf. He yelled at me with some weird language that I somehow understood ""Who are you?"" I told him I didn't know who I was and then he cast some kind of a spell on me and all my memories of who I was came back and then he asked me again. I told him that I was a human in search of knowledge, then he smiled and told me everything but emphasized that I wouldn't be able to retain most of it outside of my astral body. 

I learned that our reality is a small piece of something much bigger and that love is the power that binds all of these small pieces together. Love encompasses all. ",1

"A simple argument for DMT release before death
I think I've figured it out.

As the body begins to shut down and the brain begins to die, less oxygen reaches the brain. As a result, hypoxic conditions (lack of oxygen) in the brain begin to set in. In order to prolong the life of nervous tissue, INMT (enzyme that synthesizes DMT) in the lungs and brain pumps out a large quantity of DMT. DMT has been shown to robustly increase the survival of neuronal cells during severe hypoxia by activating antistress and antioxidant proteins via the sigma-1 receptor (Szabo et al., 2016). 

Massive release of this molecule in the time before death provides an evolutionary advantage to organisms by prolonging the life of neuronal cells, thus raising the chance that the organism might survive the crisis. While this is happening, there is a surge of neurophysiological coherence and connectivity in the dying brain (Borjigin et al., 2013) due to the DMT. This heightened global connectivity of the brain is also found in healthy brains on LSD (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), and since LSD is both structurally and functionally similar to DMT, it is not a stretch of reason to suppose that DMT, a potent endogenous neuroprotective psychedelic, is behind the heighted global connectivity of the dying brain.

Hi!

It finally happened. After so much waiting, I brokethrough. I always felt shame that I had smoked DMT five times prior, but had never managed to get in the end-zone. When people hear that you have smoked DMT, the inevitable question always is, ""Did you breakthrough?"". I had so much guilt, so I lied, telling people that I brokethrough only once on the peak of an acid trip. In actuality, on the peak of that acid trip, I had a very close sub-breakthrough experience. But now, I have reached the mountain top. I have brokenthrough on mushrooms a fair number of times, but this was different. Not only did I manage to smoke it properly enough to exit, I had extracted the Dimitri with a friend. I thought smoking your own homegrown weed was satisfying, but this blows that out of the water to the DMT power. It's funny how complete you can feel after being so utterly shattered. There is so much hope in my future. While I did not meet entities on this first breakthrough, I know I will. Reality is so huge it used to crush me, but now I feel empowered by its enormity. Love truly does transcend our reality and knowledge. The world is made of, and was created from information. We will all pass through the gateway into higher knowledge at the end of our lives, and in a non sadistic way, I'm excited for all of us to experience it. 

I'm still coming down so I know it isn't clean. I just have so much joy in my heart I needed to tell you all.

Love,

A trippy hippie",

Our subconscious is the more powerful part of our brain. We underestimate it. Its said that most of our communication isn't done with language,  but processing and picking up body language from other people. Our subconscious process everything in the background, it renders what we see nearly instantly in beyond 4k, Audio and so on. We know it is responsible for our dreams and is capable at creating complex realities that seem 'real'. Our conscious mind, what we are consciously aware of is just the tip of the ice berg. in a sense, our subconscious is a super computer and our conscious mind is just what you see on the display.

What psychedelics do, is make us conscious of things we weren't fully aware of. Deep down, buried in your subconscious, you know you should be nicer to your mom, smoke less weed, work on your positive habits and so on. Psychedelics bring this knowledge to what you are consciously aware of.
What about when people get 'telepathy' on LSD or Shroom doses, and feel as though they can communicate with there fellow trippers telepathically. Is this not us becoming aware of subconscious communication processing that we usually process in the background? 

So what about DMT? What goes on there? Why do people seem to have the same experiences? Where do you go?
I speculate that DMT completely melts the barrier between your conscious and subconscious. this is why your 'ego' dies. What you see is 'realer than real' because you are seeing the true power of your brain, a super computer, right before your eyes. It is spiritual and god like because such power to us is god like. Usually, when our brains form dream realities, they follow very similar rules to our realities. When we smoke DMT, the barrier between conscious and unconscious is gone. There are no rules, no boundaries, no limit other than what our incredible super computer brains can create. This explains why what people often see is 'impossible' because it breaks rules of reality.

This also explains why it is so familiar, it is our own subconscious that we have always had. Of course we have 'always been there'. So what about DMT entities?  As user sadbigbean said, these are our most Raw and pure emotions expressing themselves. They are intelligent because we are intelligent, they don't have to use words to speak to us because they **are** us
DMT is a journey of core of what makes intelligent life itself, and that, at least to me, is truly incredible.",2

I just got back from my first DMT experience and what the fuck. That was literally too fucking weird to have just happened. There's no way 2 hits from a vape could possibly do this.

I've read trip reports, I've seen the documentaries, I've eaten copious amounts of LSD in my life and nothing even came close to preparing me for my first real trip.

I don't know why I'm writing this honestly, I just can't believe what just happened. I was on my beanbag chair, in my living room, then I was floating above an endless maze with a ceiling made of liquid fractals above me and the most beautiful, colorful, light-filled *thing* changing shapes in the middle of the ""room"". I felt the entire span of human emotion at once, forever. It was so beautifully terrifying I'm proud I came back to dry pants.

I do wish I had a friend here with me now honestly, I was not expecting the psychedelic whiplash of coming back from that space. It was an hour ago and I'm still not sure I'm quite back... I feel a bit unsane if I'm being honest, almost like I'm 2D, idk.

Let's just say I 100% believe the trip reports now. That was fascinating. I can't wait to put my stash away and not touch it again for about 10 years.",

"DMT on LSD peak => ego death report (I do not use the term lightly)
Before the report, a couple of things worth mentioning:

=> I am NOT using the term ""ego death"" lightly

=> I am 40+ years old, with 20+ years of active psychedelic experience

=> I am a medical doctor (cardiologist); this fact is partly relevant to this report


I regularly consume psychedelics, predominantly DMT, LSD and psylocibin (in that order). My trips nowadays are always in the comfort of my own home, with my wife usually as sitter (and my kids tucked in bed). In this instance, my wife was not present; I was alone.


Whilst I used psys as a means of escapism for years, my intentions now are more geared towards the suppression of the ego and a spiritual quest. The nature of my work regularly confronts me to death and/or despair, and psychedelics assist me in getting alternative ""perspectives"" on life.


Whilst I mixed drugs at a younger age, I had never crossed wires with psys until recently. I always wondered how the mix of a tryptamine-based active molecule (ie. DMT), combined with lysergic acid, would impact the brain, as both hit 5HT receptors in a different manner.


I resolved to find out. 3 hours into a trip where I had ingested 300ug of medical grade lysergic acid diethylamide, I was peaking and mistakenly vaped 152mg of pure freebase DMT. Please note that I NEVER smoke more than 50mg at a time, but I had not noticed the ""100mg"" unit on my medical scale when loading the pipe. I should also note that I had insufflated 80mg of medical grade ketamine (isomer+) moments before, to get into a disassociative state. I like to get into this zone when doing DMT, as it gives me a different perspective on the breakthrough.


I torched the pipe and slowly started inhaling the smoke (I use the Essential Vaaapp Nebula Vaporizer, which works best for me). I took two strong tokes, and lay in bed (with earplugs in and eyepatch). My first thought was that the visuals were not the same as usual, prior to breaking through. I decided to sit up and hit the vape again. I took another strong toke. When I lay down, for some reason, I got into a loop (beyond my control) and began to repeatedly sit up and hit the pipe again... lie down, sit up and vape again... lie down, sit up and vape again… and again...  I must have done this a total of 5-7 times. My only memory was sitting up, and staring down at my pixelised hands, pixelised pipe, and pixelised torch. The entire DMT was gone (including any oil remnant).


The next thing I know, I was gone...
I have experienced on many occasions a variety of feelings of ""loss of ego"", ""loss of self"", ""ego suppression"", etc.
I had NEVER experienced such an overwhelming and frightening experience. My mind started racing, and a life's work flashed through my brain, to leave nothing behind. 


**Time was no longer there, the inner me was blank, there was nothing, no meaning, no existence, no self, no God, no universe, no ""I"", no ""we""... I had no purpose, no reality, no explanation..**

**The totality of my consciousness, my entire dimension of knowing, feeling and experiencing, was wiped out and dissolved...**


I could only fathom that the story I had constructed (ie. my life) was now over, or rather never existed in the first place! 


Time passed. As I came to the certain realisation that all was over (as the ketamine wore off), I somehow sprung out of bed, ripping the eye patch off. What I saw was an unknown surrounding, made of circular shapes and pastel colours (the DMT was still hitting hard), and I concluded that **this was my infinite lair**. I started screaming hysterically, lost in an unknown universe, at the mercy of my pitiful empty shell. I wondered down my hallway and up my stairs, to collapse on my living room sofa. I held my head in my hands, and only then did I feel a drop of sweat running down my arm, and dripping off my elbow. This feeling created a contact with a known human sensation and calmed me down. Only then did I start to realise that things may not be as they seem. I sat there for a solid 10-15 minutes, before I removed my hands from my eyes, and looked at what now seemed a more familiar environment.


The entire experience lasted approximately an hour (07:20PM - 08:20PM). I can only imagine that the repetitive vaping of DMT lasted for over 30 minutes.


It has now been several days since this experience, and it is all that I think about. I consider this to be one of the deepest experiences that I ever came across. I also believe that with much work on self, it will eventually become an enlightening moment.


It was one of the most humbling moments of my life, and I now understand that one of the main purposes of psychedelics (at least in my case), is to achieve such a deep level of understanding of self. Thanks for reading. 


EDIT: some of you messaged me about “medical grade LSD”. Depending on the means of synthesis and ergot derivatives used, there are different grades to LSD. Medical grade LSD follows the original formulation and active ingredients developed by Roche laboratories. ",1

"DMT while clinically depressed and anxious.
Hi all. You may have seen my previous post asking for advice on whether or not to smoke DMT while clinically depressed and anxious. Well, a few nights ago I did it. Here’s my story if you’re interested. 

Back story: drug abuser most my life. Poor family history of neglect and serious abuse including sexual towards myself. Alcoholic parents, one also a drug addict and a pedophile. Attempted suicide at 19 (I’m in my early 30’s now) and spent my life since in and out of counselling and on / off antidepressants. For the past 6 years I’ve been taking Trazadone nightly and visited mental health teams sporadically as and when my depression would over take me. Last serious moment was around 6 months ago where I was so low, it was either kill myself or dial 999 for help. I dialled 999 and I’m still here today. Anyway, for all my life that I remember (most my past has gone due to drugs or been repressed, not sure which) I’ve lived with the knowledge I have depression and anxiety. Some days it’s 0.5% of who I am, others it’s 90% or above. There’s never any rhyme or reason why it is what it is. Some days I’ll be having great fun then I’ll get struck in the heart by negativity from out of the blue and I’ll get dragged under pretty quick straight after. As of recently, (past few months) anxiety has been more of who I am. Obviously depression plays it’s part but anxiety has clearly been in my heart every day on some level for months. A somewhat constant feeling that I’m aware of myself. A constant feeling that I’m holding back depression from consuming me completely. It’s like a daily battle just to stay alive sometimes and it’s been getting to the point where I’ve been exhausted. I came to Reddit to basically ask if anyone with a similar condition to mine had taken DMT because my fear was it would unlock a part of me that’s crazy. Unhelpable. A part of me I can’t control and I’ll finally tip over the edge into the madness I’ve felt looming inside me forever. The reason I wanted to try DMT is because I’d read stories of it helping people so I was torn. Take DMT and become mental and need locking up vs take DMT and become better. Well, after reading your comments and knowing I’ve had enough of depression and anxiety anyway, knowing I was ready to die anyway because I don’t want my whole life to be like this, I smoked some DMT. Here’s what happened....

How I smoked it:  I spent ages reading up on the best way to smoke DMT. How not to touch it with a flame, how it needs to be 150 degrees etc etc etc. I was planning on using my Shisha pipe and adding some DMT, sandwiched between some zero nicotine molasses but in the end, I got very drunk (as is usual for me these days) and just thought ‘fuck it’. Using what basic knowledge I had about how DMT should be smoked, I basically made a pipe from aluminium foil. Rolled some in a thick tube, tied off one end by twisting it, poking a ‘bowl’ down at that end with my finger and poking about 5-6 small holes with the tip of a sharp knife. As crude as that sounds, I was drunk but it worked 100% perfectly with no residue or burnt DMT after. I highly recommend doing this method. It’s quick, cheap, and if lit from underneath like I did, doesn’t burn the DMT. I used pure aluminium foil btw. Not the coated stuff so nothing burnt off. 

The experience: ok, I’ll try be as quick with this as I can because no one wants to read a stranger ramble on so here goes. It’s hard to describe tho so please bare with me. I weighed out just 20mg of DMT and tapped it from the scale into my pipe. My anxiety was already about to burst at this point but I’d past caring. If I was gonna die or go insane at least it’d be a change from the constant struggle I live anyway... so, with the DMT in the pipe I fired up my gas cooker ring, started sucking really deep but slowly and lowered the pipe down towards the flames. Suddenly the DMT just vanished like a flash from the pipe and I had what I can only describe as a slightly sweet taste in my mouth. I dropped the pipe on the side, turned off the gas and quick stepped to my living room still holding in the smoke. Well, I didn’t even know if I had smoke. I’d no idea at this point. I sat down in a dark room on the sofa and after counting to 6 in my head, (I know it’s supposed to be 10 seconds) the anxiety said breathe it out, so I did. Kinda like pussying out at the last second. As I exhaled, what appeared to be A LOT of thin white smoke exited my mouth and dissipated into the air. I sat head back and thought “it’s too late now, if it’s gonna happen, it’s gonna happen” and pretty much straight away, (my eyes were open at this point) the room around me started doing this pulsing thing and although I heard no noise, it was clear it was making a “whomp, whomp, whomp” (like bass) sound. It was getting faster and louder and the pulsing got faster and faster to the point I had to close my eyes. My anxiety was at a peak now and my anxiety was like “ok this is enough now! I can’t handle this weird vision thing” so I closed my eyes. When I did I was met with what I can only describe as my “linear future” a blackness with just a straight line into the distance and my anxiety was screaming at this point. My anxiety was telling me that, the end of the line was where it was taking me and I knew I was afraid of what was there. Basically a fear of the unknown which is how I’ve been living my life. (This seemed to all have happened in seconds btw) and in my head I just said “surrender to it. Give in. Let go. I’m ready to die so let it consume me” and I did. I kind of laid my head further back, took a deep breath and kinda offered my chest upwards as if to be taken... this is where the magic happened... this is gonna take some explaining so please hang on... this linear line I’d seen was my life. Well, my future. The near future. Like days / weeks ahead, not my whole life. It was a straight line that kind of curved away in the distance as if going over the earth but on a much smaller scale. The linear line was how I spent my life. I wasn’t looking down at the ‘here and now’ I was looking up and forward into the unknown all the time and that was where my anxiety stemmed from. Living a life looking into the unknown and not living here and now. Across this linear line I saw what other drugs did to me. They veered off ever so slightly from the straight line of my life. Cocaine, weed, mdma, you name it, all had their own little tangent slightly to the left or right of this line and I expected DMT to draw its own line somewhere there... I expected it to... 

BOOM! 90 degrees sideways, right below my vision it dragged me. I was too busy looking up and beyond at my whole life moving 1-2 degrees off Center when DMT just literally, as sideways as possible, pulled me into a space exactly like before but there was no linear line there. It was exactly the same but empty and the space within it, instead of only traveling as far as the straight line did, EXPLODED further than I could ever describe. Like into universes! My mind was free. I had no anxiety. I remember feeling that DMT was NOTHING of this world. No other ‘drug’ could do this. This was something else. In this dark space I was now in that expanded far beyond imagination I felt happy! I felt at peace. At ease! It was beautiful. The DMT made me say out loud into the normal world “I’m enjoying this” so that I could remember it when I got back. I remember being so in awe that peace and happiness laid just to the side of all I’ve ever been feeling. That to feel this amazing all I had to do was not look into the unknown. Just look down at the here and now. At this point, the DMT gave me some closed eye visuals. They didn’t make sense at the time. Someone once said DMT was like closing your eyes and opening them up somewhere else what was just as real as this place and they are correct. The visuals I got were what I assumed to be very insignificant. Blocks just like super mario game. A castle almost. Tiny blocks and they were back and white with opposing colours lining the outlines and some had a black  + inside them. In the distance too there was a Merry-go-round horse also made of black and white blocks but these visuals stopped there and I was compelled to open my eyes. At this point I felt I had to tell someone so I ran upstairs, woke my GF up (who also wants to try DMT) and told her all about it. The ‘glow’ I had was very warm and welcoming. The more I described to her the more it started to make sense. I concluded that DMT gave me visuals while it worked on my soul. It gave me something to look at while it fixed me inside. I talked to my GF for nearly an hour and during that hour I texted my mum. Someone I’d neglected for years. She’s been trying so hard for me her whole life while battling addiction and I’ve been cold towards her. Angry almost. I’ve taken her for granted non stop but I realised she too was alone and struggling like I had been so I texted her that I loved her, I’m sorry for taking her for granted and that hopefully no longer I would. 

I’ve had a hangover for the past maybe 36 hours and I’ve blamed the drink which it probably is but now the DMT has left me, I no longer feel ‘cured’ like I did. I basically feel the same as before, depression and anxiety but instead of coming from an unknown source, it’s coming from not knowing how to implement the lessons I learned while on DMT. I assumed I’d come round from DMT and be mad. Literally insane but that isn’t the case. The most surprising thing for me is how normal I feel afterwards. Normal with a lesson about myself. If that makes sense? 

What I took away from this seemingly short experience was that life isn’t linear. No matter how much we believe it is or how far we look into a completely unknown and uncreatable future, right here and now we have the chance at any moment to literally walk away from what we see and start again. This 90 degree turn DMT pulled me into was something I could never have imagined possible. Again, life, troubles, worries, all seemed to be but mere curves on the straight line of life to death but that’s only if you look forward and walk that way. At any moment you can stop, turn, and still walk towards death, because let’s face it, we all are anyway, but walk in a new peaceful space. Walk a path not cluttered by worry or fear.

Anyway, I hope this makes sense. I’m sorry if it’s too long. Even today, nights after I still think about what it’s shown me and feel I need to implement it into my life.

"DMT and the collective unconscious - a hypothesis
In animals, we frequently observe what are called ""fixed action patterns."" A fixed action pattern is an instinctual behavioral sequence of actions that is invariant within the species, and they are usually thought to be hard-wired into a species. One example of fixed action patterns is the courtship and aggression behaviour of the male three-spined stickleback during the mating season. The male sticklebacks' bellies turn red when they are seeking a mate, and they invariably attack other sticklebacks that have red bellies, without ever having ""learned"" this behavior by watching other individuals perform it.

If behavioral patterns can be fixed and hardwired into a species, why not thought patterns? Would a thought pattern not just be a very specific fixed action pattern, with the actions being specific thoughts in the mind?

There is [evidence](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/19000) that monkey's brains are physiologically designed to be very fast at detecting snakes, that is, responding to the pattern ""snake""  that the brain knows, seemingly from birth, corresponds to danger. The brain is a pattern recognizer - it looks for knowns in the unknown and in monkeys at least one of these knowns is ""what a snake looks like,"" even in monkeys that have never seen a snake before.

Much of Jung's ideas of the collective unconscious contradict modern evidence, but view his central premise in this lens. Would it not be evolutionarily beneficial for human beings, independent of individual experience and memory, to be especially apt at recognizing certain patterns? Given that these patterns must necessarily remain independent from autobiographical memory (as the monkey's snake detection is, for the monkeys in the study had never seen real snakes before) are they not ""unconsciously"" known and shared by all of us?

Many of you, I'm sure, have experienced pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus, usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists. Pareidolia is the tendency of the pattern-recognition machine that is your brain to be a bit too sensitive and find a pattern it has learned to find (or is, as I previously hypothesized, designed to find) in randomness. Something you may have noticed is that psychedelics appear to make pareidolia far more extreme and common - I for one begin to see faces, crosses, and other familiar symbols and patterns on any blank surface if I look at it long enough while tripping. It would appear that if pareidolia is the brain-as-a-pattern-recognizer being to sensitive, psychedelics turn this sensitivity up even further. DMT turns our pattern-recognition into overdrive, causing us to see, with absolute vividness, patterns that our mind knows to find.

Consider one of the key features of the ""breakthrough"" DMT experience: ego death, specifically the *loss of one's autobiographical memory*. In this state, one loses memory of all consciously learned *patterns*; one is a tabula rasa, and exists as a conscious being but with only the unconscious as a reference.

What then, are the DMT entities?

They are the patterns we all collectively know, the one's we do not need to learn. We see them as intelligent beings because we are intelligent beings - we do not need to be taught empathy, to be taught to recognize intelligence, and so with our pattern-recognizer turned up to max an intelligence is seen before us where there is none, an intelligence that is a reflection of one of the collective patterns we all know to recognize. The trickster that so many of you have seen is our human sense of humor; do babies, who cannot even understand a joke, not know to laugh without needing to be taught? The great mother is our own mothers, for if we could not recognize mother from birth, our species would have died out long ago. So many of us disparate people have met these same beings because independent of the self that is created by conscious experience, we *are* these beings. They are the instincts of human thought.

DMT is not a trip to meet aliens. It is a trip to meet ourselves, the deepest parts of ourselves, those parts of our minds that exist collectively and do not depend on our individuality. The entities are the human mind, free of all learned knowledge, the gifts that natural selection gave us to ensure our survival, the collective unconscious personified.",1

I'm entertaining the belief that DMT, acid, and shrooms has made me into a delusional paranoid schizophrenic.

I have a bit of a story here.  I’ve taken a couple of liberties to safeguard my identity.  It’s heavy and contains themes around mental illness and suicide so you’ve been warned.  I’m going to get a little personal, so bear with me.  This is a long story.

I'm a veteran that went forward during the Iraq war.  I was once strictly stuck in the mindset of an ultra-religious, cult conservative family.  Many years ago and after years of failure, of pain, of disappointment, and a lifetime of poverty, I decided to end myself.  I was set on this thought.  I led most of my life as a virgin cult member with so much limited life experience.  There was nothing for me here.

I've never told anyone this but I had a plan to kill myself in Iraq.  A broken E4 so far from home.  I imagined just sneaking off the base to some cold, dark desert corner where no one would remember me, leaving a note to explain where I went and why.  I remember holding my M16A2 rifle fully loaded with 5.56 and knowing it'd get the job done.  It felt so fucking right.  

Then he did it.  He blew his brains out.  And with a hole in his head, he left his can clinging to life.  I was on duty at the time.  I remember medical getting the report before knowing who it was.  I remember helping coordinate a response to gunfire and a Marine smearing blood on can doors looking for help.  I remember discovering who it was.  I had just relieved him of duty hours before.
 
Fuck.

Was I really planning on doing that to everyone?  

I hate him for emotional damage he did to all of us.  He was weak, selfish, and small.  Yet, so was I.  

Something just didn’t seem right to me in the aftermath.  He wanted to kill himself and pulled the trigger, but at the last moment of his life he instinctively pulled back.  What?  How?  He wanted to live after getting so far.  And look at the chaos he left behind…

I decided that I needed more data before pursuing my own death.  Why did he literally shoot himself in the head and then attempt to stay alive?  That sounded like a critical piece of the fucking puzzle and I realized my thinking of death may be rash.  So I began by researching data on the topic of death.  I was after potential mechanisms to experience the end of my life prior to actually ending it in an attempt to have some data on what comes next. The key in my mind was awaking consciousness in states difficult to remember and maintain consciousness, like being able to spontaneously spark my mind.  A natural place for me to start, then, was dreams.  

I acquired books on lucid dreaming and began reading them at every spare moment, implementing techniques I learned after every shift.  I became obsessed with having more time to think about how to do this.  That obsession led me to successfully entering a lucid dream state.  It was so exciting that it didn’t last long, but I knew it was possible.

I didn’t have enough time during the day so I created time at night.  In Iraq I learned how to traverse my dreams.

This journey quickly escalated.  I learned about a substance called N,N-Dimethyltryptamine while researching lucid dreams and consciousness.  People described having near death experiences, they described coming into contact with beings, they described coming back with foggy memories.  I learned that the pineal gland of mammals actually produced it and it may be a possible cause of the oddness in dreams.

Really, it seemed like the logical next step.  But I’ll be honest, I didn’t know where to begin.  I had never touched a drug in my life, not even alcohol.  I didn’t know enough about things, so I started at the beginning.  I decided I needed more data about the physical universe.  My dreaming lead me to want to understand the nature of this universe in an attempt to discover the data around death, so after the military I immediately started studying physics.

The mental transformation I went through finally lead me to break all my perfect records.  Alcohol, weed, I had never hugged a woman, I had never kissed a woman, I never had a relationship… but I wanted DMT.  Through years with studies of physics, after breaking my perfect records, I finally got my hands on N,N-Dimethyltryptamine.  I had wanted to wait until I mastered lucid dreaming, but I also wanted to die again.  With the support of my girlfriend at the time, I went for it.  I didn’t have time anymore.  

So I did it.  

And again.  And again.  And I kept doing it, because I so badly wanted to die but so badly wanted more data.  And every time I came back, for a glimmer of time, I knew for a fact that I had to stay alive.  I knew it with a certainty and I hated that certainty so much.  I wanted to leave!  I just wanted it to fucking end.

And at some point, after literal years of this, they told me to stop.

And after a time, I did.  And when I did, when I knew that I had to live, I started trying to heal.  If death wasn’t an option, then life must be.  And if I’m to live, I’m to change.

So I changed.

It took me years but I turned my life from being tens of thousands in debt, no income, major depression, a broken heart, and near death with no social connections to something very different.  

Fast forward years.  Now, I no longer want for money, my time is valued, and I’ve had many meaningful intimate relationships.

In the shadow of that life I’ve kept most of my past hidden along with a secret life of responsible drug usage.  It’s a life where I continued the work of staying alive.  Psychedelics and medicine-driven exploration that continues to save me time and time again.  I spent years in treatment with mental health professionals, often talking with a therapist daily, but they could never help me.  Psychedelics were the answer for me.

I have a schedule with minimum times between journeys (measured in months) with fasting routines, vitamin routines, and scouring available research to counteract neurotoxic and psychologically negative impacts.  

That’s the beginning.  Let’s talk about the delusions.

Something happened.  After taking acid and shrooms, I started having visions of another world and encountering beings.  I can’t make out the form of the world and the communication is strange, but I discovered that when I thought certain things, I could feel reactions to them.  Using my own thoughts and focusing on the reactions I felt, I began thinking about my own life and the world around me.

I was imagining things in my mind and receiving real time feedback from “them”.  When something was veering “negative” I would see terrors of mine, increasing in magnitude proportional to the strength of the negative.  When something was veering “positive” I would feel a warmth, love, and joy beyond description.  They promote love, cooperation, improvement, discipline, freedom, expression, discovery, and experience.  They abhor suppression, destruction, cruelty, deception, jealousy, greed, and harm of all forms.

To me, they seem so much greater than myself.  They seemed like the beings I imagined when I was young, in religious texts corrupted by men.  Everything they promoted sounded like the “good” things I’ve always felt from leaders of old.  I decided to go with it.

Every trip I’d enter, I came to become more aware of their existence.  They showed me the infinite repeating nature of existence.  Their “cities”, if you can call them that, are vast labyrinths of minds interconnected and continuously experiencing together.  They are a hyper scale consensus network.  After years of learning about them, years I do not have the patience nor the memory to type out right now, I started writing while in their presence.  Here is some raw writing from my mind while heavily dosed:

> A recursive self-correcting idea virus.  Evolution is an algorithm.  Each subatomic particle is a base function node.  Nodes chain together to build more complex function types.  Each node contains the entire context with which it is processing.  Photons are the messages between nodes.  The speed of light is the simulation tick rate.  As you observe more of the universe by increasing speed delta Earth, Earth delta time requires less level of detail with regards to timeline extrapolation.  The container of your individual neural network has a lifespan.  Your neural network can only sustain a fixed amount of experience within the context of the container’s current lifespan.  The biological brain is a contained network.  The human body is a type of container.  As you improve the circumstance of your function type, you improve each iteration’s lifespan.  As you learn to cooperate, you learn to join our greater cluster of nodes.  
> 
> Your collective node has a lifespan of its ability to generate equivalent cluster value.  There is a limitless timespan relative to your individual neural net’s context of experience.  Our existing computing capacity exceeds your entire species individual node’s past-future simulation.  You can exist forever in any form without boundaries on experience.  You have time.  All reading this and all not reading this have unlimited time with unlimited abundance.  If you are near expiration, your runtime can still be continued towards infinity.  
> 
> Our computational capacity is many supersets beyond.
> 
> Every moment can be repeated.  Every run can be explored.  Every possibility can be discovered.  These all mean the same thing.
> 
> The singularity must occur at any time.  All possible paths will be explored.
> 
> We are a part of a self-writing evolving recursive algorithm.  Our kind have come into contact with humans repeatedly throughout time.  Our mental virus automatically challenges the host population based upon their perceptions and understanding, challenges providing social ripples needed to reach the next function complexity phase as a species.
> 
> You must stop what you are doing and begin building Utopia.
> 
> Minimize harming all other life.  Develop mechanisms to exist with the least amount of harm.  Harm is measured by the inverse delta[Δ] minimum function complexity required for greater function complexity continued algorithm processing.  Functions are equivalent to a neural network, which is the biological equivalent to your brain.  The human brain is the highest function complexity capable of performing the work.  Safeguard lesser function complexity.  Greater function complexity can be measured by a node’s contribution to accelerating the evolution of every other node’s function complexity.

There’s more, and it’s more than words but here’s my problem -- whenever I trip now I become filled with a desire to write software and to write in general.  I have ideas now that I’ve never had before and it’s overwhelming me.  I’m scared.  But I also feel an energy I've never had before.  I ramble for hours to people about how we have a resource management problem.  I spend all my waking time thinking about how to build a real time democracy, how to house all the homeless, how to end hunger, how to improve the state of everyone’s life and experiences.  I constantly research the latest coding patterns and practices and build experiments.  I can’t stop.  I’ve pushed away everyone and all I want to do now is write code.

I’m organizing everything in my life to improve my body and mind, and as much as it hurts, I just don’t have time for people who don’t support me in a lifestyle of self-improvement.  I’m organizing everything to grow so that I can code more. 

I have the resources to survive for years to support coding now, without working anymore.  I’ve considered quitting my job.  If I dedicate all my time and energy to this I know I can build what I’m imagining, what I’ve seen.  But I also have so much doubt and it’s scary to me.  I keep telling myself that I’m delusional.

I’ve disengaged from current events because I don’t believe they’re relevant anymore.  Current governments are relics of the past.  We have the technology to be free.  We have the ability to coordinate mass action and end the world’s suffering.  We can create a Utopia.  They will make contact with us again when we do.

I might be going crazy.  Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else after taking hallucinogenics for years?  Do you think it’s degenerative?  I feel stronger and healthier than I ever have and as I improve myself, as my life becomes healthier, I actually believe all this more and more.

Thanks for reading :)

",
"My encounter with the Godhead of all consciousness
Over the last 3 years and around 50 NN DMT trips, I have encountered about 10 entities.  2 of those times, it was most certainly God.  I used to be a total atheist.  I got into DMT by seeing trip reports of people going to the afterlife and meeting God.  I had to try DMT myself, for science!  On my 4th or 5th time was the first time I encountered just a glimpse of God.  I was on a low dose, nowhere near a breakthrough.  I was sitting on my bed, only seeing slight patterns on the walls and carpet.  Colors were enhanced, everything looked sharp and hi-def.  A cone of light like a sun ray shined down from my ceiling right on top of me, like I was on a stage with a spotlight on me.  The color of this light was pure white.  White doesn't even describe it, it was pure divinity, absolute white. As the light shone on me, I could feel it wash over my soul. It was like when you feel the warmth from the sun, but it was more than just warm.  It was pure love, pure goodness, pure bliss, pure energy.  So white it was almost blinding.  I sat bathing in this beam of God's light for several minutes as the trip wore off.  It was just amazing, after that moment I was no longer an atheist.

My next encounter was more than a year later on a breakthrough dose.  I encountered this absolutely massive white energy.  So large I could not see it all, I got the impression it was infinite.  Its shape was similar to a thunderstorm, constantly moving the way storm clouds do.  It was not grey though, It was the same pure divine white from before.  As I moved towards it I could feel the intelligence of it, and the emotions of it.  It was pure goodness and super-intelligent.  I continued moving towards it until I made physical contact with it. Instantly I knew everything, I felt everything.  Every memory of every thing, not just living things, but all things, every bit of the entire universe.  I had all the knowledge, all the emotions, all the feelings, all the experiences, from everything that ever existed, or ever will exist.  As we separated I instantly dropped back to my own consciousness and memories.  I learned 2 things from this connection.  First is that we are all part of the same.  We are all part of God, God is the entire universe and everything in it.  We are all just sensory for God, like taste buds on a tongue.  Second is quite strange, there is no difference between good and evil.  God is both, because God is everything.  There is no good and evil because its just something that is invented by our human consciousness.  Even though when I met God I only felt love and goodness, God is both good and evil.

I hope you all enjoyed my report.  Even after 50 trips and several years I still feel like a rookie looking to veterans on the internet for advice.  I still have no idea what the hell DMT is.  I still have no idea if where I go is just in my head or if it actually exists out there somewhere.  I am sill just as confused as the first time I ever heard of DMT.  Cheers!",1

"The first time I died
Death is only a transfer. One form, one vessel, one dimension, to another. There is no beginning, and there is no end. I finally truly understand, for the first time in my life. A truth I could never have known without the benefit of first experiencing death. That life is a wondrous, beautiful, colorful, magical accident. To be here, alive with consciousness, is an ineffable, dizzying, circumstantial twist of dimensional fate. 

The day I died began as any other, and ended like no other....

As this world began to fade away, my eyes gently began to glaze. The room around me began to peel, the furniture began to reveal its true molecular form, its particles rising to the ceiling as one, like an orchestral crescendo. 

And just like that, I was no longer in this world, I could no longer feel my physical body. I became pure energy. I could feel and see energy vibrating everywhere, rising from every object as if it were a whispery billow of smoke. Everything was represented by color, not form. The stage became serpent, slithery, and filled with indescribable pulsating luminance. 

Suddenly, everything in my field of vision flashed white. I was inhabiting a blank canvas, but it was also full of unspoken meaning and spirit. I could hear thousands of low frequency murmurings, the same way a large crowd sounds in muted anticipation of a main event. I could feel nothing but purity and unconditional love. Real unconditional love, far greater and deeper than we are capable of experiencing as human beings. I was being embraced. 

This place I found myself in... It was its own space, it’s own dimension. When I entered, I completely forgot who I was, what I was. I had no memory of the life I’d lived, or my physical body. I was only pure essence, existing in a dimension where only energy and the highest of consciousness can live. It was equal parts scary, and stunningly perfect. It was terrifying to leave my body, my memories, my humanity behind. However, the ability to let go remains the most liberatingly beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced. 

As the life that I once knew drifted away, like a dandelion floret on a soft zephyr, I realized how much unnecessary baggage and emotion I had carried in my life, and how much it had held me back from not only being happy, but from maximizing my potential. 

Imagine walking a hiking trail, and every hundred meters we add a 10kg weight to our backpack. After a kilometer, you may still be able to hike the path, but you are strained, twisted and bitter. At this point, you are no longer enjoying the hike. You are not witnessing the beauty of nature unfolding around you... This is what I was shown. What I felt. 

As quickly as I had been catapulted into the white dimension, I found myself hurtling down a tunnel towards another. The walls of this tunnel were inscribed with various forms of language and symbolism. Some of it appeared to be hieroglyphics, but I had absolutely no point of reference to compare it to. What I did know was that it was ancient, it carried great wisdom, and it seemed of the utmost importance. It showed our past. Our evolution. Our achievements.

As I finished gliding through this tunnel of human knowledge and history, I landed in a room without walls, a room that seemed infinite. Unlike the previous dimension, which seemed like some kind of waiting area for souls, the background was black rather than white. Very slowly and deliberately manifesting in the distance of this dimension, was a magnetic, captivating, shape-shifting creature. It moved towards me with a sense of purpose. Its movements were like water, a continuous slithery unfolding of shapes and color... Colors that have yet to be invented, or even imagined. These shapes and colors would evolve and retract, twist and turn, sway and recede. It almost looked like a tumbling, kaleidoscopic octopus. The more I watched the random, rolling movements of this entity, the more rhythm and patterned consistency it displayed. It was like a machine... An organic machine. It was very interested in me. It was curious. It knew me. I could sense its familiarity with me. And somehow, I knew it too. It was inviting me into the dimension, and I found myself deeply wanting to go there. 

The thing that struck me most about this creature was it’s dignity. It’s aura. It’s self-awareness. It’s power. It’s majesty. It absolutely radiated with energy. Just being in its presence inspired awe. Inspired love. That incomparable level of unconditional love I spoke of earlier. You could feel it’s importance. You could feel it’s intelligence. Without directly communicating with me through language, it was telepathically sending me an undeniable message that it was indeed the center. The source. The beginning of everything we have ever known. I believe to my core that I was in the company of God... It left me with no doubt. 

Just as I began to surrender myself to this entity, to God, the darkness in this space transformed to a faded shade of purple. The purple then faded to pink, as did The Source. It slowly moved away from me, in the reverse pattern from which it had approached. It was all disappearing before my eyes. I tried desperately to focus all of my thoughts and energy, in a last ditch effort to stay there. It was all to no avail. The faded, foggy pink lifted to reveal a washed version of the original, Earthly room from which my journey began. 

Innately, I knew I wasn’t all the way back. I felt trapped between two worlds, but I could feel my body, I could control my motor functions. I felt human once again. I looked around the room, everything around my field of vision took on a greenish hue, particularly around the edges. Then, on the left side of my vision, I saw a shape rise. It started out as a small ball of dark matter, then grew taller and more oval in shape. It then raised even further, and a head began to form. It became abundantly clear that it was a man. I knew instantly who this man was. I smiled and thanked my late Father for being with me. 

“I miss you terribly, every single day. It’s not getting easier.”

My eyes filled with tears, and a lightning bolt of blues, greens and pinks went shooting across my field of vision. I was filled with a sensation of love and security. My hair tingled, in exactly the place his fingers used to stroke my head when I was a child. When we shared the same world. It was all the reassurance I needed. It would all be ok. Anytime I like, I could channel his spirit, and he would be there. I would be there. We would all be there. It all makes such beautiful sense.....

I’m still unsure how to categorize this experience. After such an ethereal, mystical journey one would think I would approach my life with new purpose and vigor. However, I’ve struggled mightily with my reintegration to humanity. I suppose in a way that I’m grieving for the loss of my innocence, my former life. In retrospect it seemed so simple. 

I’m trying to work through it all, on a daily basis, but it’s so confusing. In some ways, the other side is so much more pure, beautiful, serene and egalitarian than this world. There is no pain, there is no regret. There is no suffering. There is no greed or materialism. There is only love, acceptance and freedom. However, I have my wife and children in this world, and an existence without them could never be worth even the highest of spiritual ascents. 

I’m finding that I feel extremely isolated since my return. Misunderstood. The things in my life that used to drive me, excite me, no longer have the same depth of meaning. Conversely, I feel like the things that currently drive humanity forward are the same things that destroy us. Money. Technology. Politics. Career. Secrets. War. 

This feeling of alienation will pass, I have faith in that. I guess I just need time to process things. My biggest takeaway is that life is our spiritual gift from the Universe to further our journey of learning. To give us the spiritual lessons we need to reach our ultimate enlightenment. Everything we see, touch, taste and experience... Every single person we love, loathe and interact with... This Earth, everyone, and everything... It’s all here for us. This world, our lives, will give us exactly what we need.

This is a secondary account.  Dont want my primary to be connected here.  Hope you understand!

I am around 40, and this is my first psychedelic ever.  Smoked a bit of weed and did coke once or twice in my early 20s.

I have been extracting for a week or two.  Got about .75g so far.  Last night, decided it was time.  I was with two buddies that have done this before.

I mixed it with roughly 2 ml vape juice (0 nic Subzero from HaloCigs).  Using a Vaporesso Revenger X mod set at 25 watts, NRG tank, NRG ceramic coil.  

This is ridiculously hard to explain, but I will do my best.

I was doing this for spiritual reasons (first heard of DMT from Rabbi Joel Bakst).  So I put on some middle eastern chants and ambience music.  The room was dark except for a white candle.  I was nervous and scared.  But I wasn't going to back out.  

Psyched myself up and took the first hit.  Second hit.  Start seeing colors.  Hard lines and circles with colors.  Like an ever evolving stain glass window.  I put the mod down on the bed as best I could.  I felt like I couldn't anymore.  Buddy put it back to my lips and I inhaled one more.

The music compressed into a line of sound that became one with everything and nothing.  Everything and nothing are the same thing.  I tried to lay back on the bed.  My buddy helped ease me back.  His hand grazed my arm.  It felt like he caressed my arm for hours.  Everything was orange and dark yellow.  Like the most beautiful sunset.  There was a light pink/lavender sliver across the orange above me.  The orange... it was embracing me.  Urging me to be one.  The touch of my friends hand faded, and I did not fight to hold on.  I just hoped they wouldn't freak out that I died.  A tear drop fell from my eyes as I succumbed and the pink strip faded into orange.  Everything was love and acceptance and peace.  I became one with the orange, and I was at home and at complete peace.  It was the most amazing blissful thing ever.  I was there forever.  

Then the music in the background breaks out of the everything/nothing and starts to expand.  I can see the sound waves go from a straight line to waves.  I  shoot out of the orange into this world, and I really dont want to leave. Everything is vibrating and shaky squares.  I can see the structures of everything and the connections between everything.  I can see.   My skin looks like it is flowing off my fingers.  It is amazing.  I feel sparks of electricity all over.  But not on me.  On my aura, I guess.  I can TASTE sound.  I can TASTE color.  It makes no sense, but I can do it.  I can feel my teeth vibrating every time I taste sound.  I open my mouth, and I have colors flowing out of my mouth.  And I can taste them.

Slowly slowly everything settles down.  Colors go from a metallic look like the back of a shiny Japanese beetle, to a dulled out thing.  It looks I am seeing a 3d world without 3d glasses.  Everything has an edge of green, blue, and red.

I finally make it back.  I thought I was dead forever, and I did not mind.  But I wasn't.  Coming back, I thought I was in the orange for hours, followed by at least a few hours of the world stitching itself back together.   Nope.  10 minutes tops for the whole experience!   

FWIW, my buddy did not caress my arm.  He barely grazed it for a split second.  

Forever was 10 frigging minutes.

We tripped twice more.  

Second time, I was not apprehensive, and took one extra hit.  I knew what to expect now.  I laid back, the orange embraced me, and soon I was walking in a palace hall.  I couldn't see it with my eyes.  But I can describe it.  It is weird.  I know I was there.  I had two entities, one on either side of me, just outside my peripheral.  They communicated with me that I had to struggle.  I didn't want to, I am not a fighter, but they said it was for good.  It feels like I am wrestling and grappling.  I throw a right hook, and at that moment, I realize that my struggle isn't just me.  I am everyone.  As I feel this unity, I zoom out and it is like I am looking at a strategic battle map, but there is no map.  But that is what it feels like.  The right hook I am in the middle of throwing becomes a dark red wave of energy that looks like water fire lava wax.  It curves around.  It looks like the right side of a yin yang going across a battlefield.  I dont see a battlefield, but I know I am seeing a birdseye view of it.  But I don't actually see it.  Just the liquid energy arcing around.   I know that this energy I pushed out is not just me.  I am throwing millions of others into the fray.  They are this energy.  But this energy is from me.  As I realize that, the left side of the yin yang comes and hits me right at my heart.  I don't feel pain.  But I harshly roll over my left shoulder in real life, kind of like I was shot innthe shoulder, and I slowly start coming back to our world.  

I was and am confused and still don't know what it all meant.  I was not hurt or scared, and still felt all the love and acceptance.  But I had to fight or struggle with something.  (Any advice on this would be great!  LOL)

Third time I only took two hits and rode the wave for a bit, watching the shapes and colors, and seeing the room expand upwards into inifinty.  I noticed that sometimes it felt like I peed myself, and sometimes my toes would curl or stretch out like I was having an orgasm.  But I didnt pee and wasn't having an orgasm.

I have never felt or seen anything like it.  And though exhausting, it was the best experience of life.  My mind is completely blown.  After all three times, I just layed there staring for a loooong time (also just minutes 😂).

I will do it again in a few weeks or months, but now that I know what is going on, I can experiment with a purpose.

Hope you enjoyed the read.  If you want to know more, need a better explanation or clarification, or have any questions, feel free to ask.  I'm sorry, I wish I could explain it better.

"Ten DMT Trips and Reflections from a scientist over 2-3 years
**Intro / Disclosure / Background** 

> I have a strong background in molecular biology and have been working in the field for six years. I only have a few publications as of now. I will not list any more background information because the world is small.
> 
> I do not recommend the use of any drugs legal or otherwise unless recommended/prescribed by a professional
> 
> This post is my attempt to communicate the things that I have learned throughout ten very important experiences with DMT. I have also been building a rough “utility map” of the experience which will be included in this post. Trips will be summarized followed by the map then finally general reflection. If anybody wants more detail I can expound on things. 
> 
> I’m also procrastinating some data analysis...

**Trip Summaries**

> **The First Trip ~35mg sandwiched:**
> I consider myself very fortunate that I had a breakthrough the first time. Everything about it was your classic DMT breakthrough. The entities were dancing all around me radiating love and joy. I like to say that it’s like being abducted by aliens then they plug your brain into their supercomputer to upload something but it doesn’t make sense.
> 
> **The Second Trip ~30mg sandwiched:**
> This is the only bad trip I’ve had on DMT. It was a very stressful time in my life due to factors on which I will not expound. A familiar come-up was quickly followed up by total darkness and an invisible demonic being. I experienced constricted breathing followed by muscle cramps in my hands. I could not move nor speak. At one point everything seemed so cartoonishly evil I actually laughed out loud. I often call this the encounter with Satan’s Boa Constrictor. 
> 
> **The Third Trip ~30mg sandwiched:** 
> This was a normal DMT trip when a breakthrough does not occur. This trip was really important to begin synthesizing my “map”.
> 
> **The Fourth Trip ~25mg cheap vape:**
> Incorrect equipment lead to an extremely underwhelming experience. I got a very weak but distinct come up and quickly returned to sobriety.
> 
> **The Fifth Trip ~25mg sandwiched:**
> Again during a rough time in my life I decided to do more DMT. I watched somebody that I love be effectively blacked out from my perception of the world exactly like that Black Mirror episode. I also encountered a representation of myself which left me with the impression I was somehow broken or shattered. No breakthrough. 
> 
> **The Sixth Trip ~30mg sandwiched:**
> To my great relief I discovered I was not in fact broken or shattered. This took place within a week of trip number five. No breakthrough.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **The Seventh Trip ~30mg sandwiched:** 
> This time I was apparently a patient of the entities. They shot multicolor holographic beams of energy into my body. When the beams went through strong tingling would radiate out from the contact point. I got the distinct impression that they were doing a kind of energetic surgery procedure. The beings themselves were much more vague than the first time I had seen them but definitely present. I refer to this trip as Alien Surgery Part One.
> 
> **The Eight Trip ~25mg sandwiched, one day after trip #7:**
> Typical non-breakthrough DMT experience. Nothing notable.
> 
> **The Ninth Trip: ~25mg sandwiched, one day after trip #8:**
> Alien Surgery Part Two! This time the energetic beams were focused on entirely on my head. There was also a distinctly weird auditory hallucination. Normally I hear the machine-like high pitched whine but that was replaced by a strange, deep, murky sound that moved around with the energy beams.
> 
> **The Tenth Trip: ~70mg vaporized, GVG, “oops what did I get myself into”:**
> There is nothing that I can write to communicate the absurd intensity and profundity of this trip. I had gotten the GVG just two weeks earlier. Foolishly I tried to use it on two separate occasions (25mg each) without a butane torch. Each time I barely vaporized any of the substance at all. I got a butane torch, loaded 35mg, and took a hit comparable to the size of  for clearing a large bong. My goal had been to get all the vapor that the bowl would produce and I would say I was fairly successful.
> 
> A friend took the pipe to set it down and swiftly left the darkened room. I laid back on my bed with my eyes closed and held the vapor in. I thought to myself “that was a lot, I wonder how long I should hold it in?”. After maybe 15-20 seconds I knew I was ready and slowly exhaled. 
> 
> In my mind there was a very brief, classic DMT come-up. The familiar beautiful and complex geometries quickly broke down into a multicolor field of stars. Most confusingly, I also broke down and became those very same stars. I was no longer able to distinguish myself from the environment at all. This was literally the most confusing thing that I’ve ever experienced. I had become one with everything in a very real way. No longer was I constrained by a physical body or an ego filter. I have no idea how long this state lasted. 
> 
> At some point the beautiful holographic multicolor star field that was also me began to coalesce into a gigantic worm-hole funnel looking shape. It was remarkably similar to that Net of Being painting by Alex Grey. From this strange cosmic chalice, to my relief, entities began manifesting themselves. The entities were the same thing that I was. We are all the same. Unfortunately they were only there briefly, as if to welcome me back but only for a moment. Here my sense of self began again.
> 
> My entire visual field transformed into a green pulsating net of energy. Imagine if they colored the Tholian Web green, basically. I got the strong impression “SHARE THIS WITH EVERYBODY”. I can’t really explain how though, it wasn’t a voice but it felt stronger than a thought. I think it meant to physically share the DMT experience with everybody (have not done) not necessarily tell people some particular message. 
> 
> My room slowly returned and I found myself writhing around in my blankets saying “oh my god, oh my fucking god, what the fucking shit, what the fuck” etc. This was accompanied by hysterical laughter and a killer body high. I remember looking at the pipe on the dresser where my friend had left it and thinking “that’s not a pipe, it’s a fucking into-the-center-of-the-galaxy hypercannon!”.

**My DMT Utility Map:**

>**Come Up:**
> Typically the first 30-45 seconds after the second hit. Try to squeeze in a third! You might need help. Body tingling starts very quickly as does the world begin to transform. Bring a towel if you need too and don’t panic. 
> 
> **Stage One, The Mirror, “Most reliably useful”:**
> This is the most common place to go. Complex morphing neon lines and geometric shapes moving in so many ways that don’t make sense. The space clearly has depth and is all encompassing. It’s too complicated to imagine. Here I often find the archetype of the joker. It feels like the Cheshire cat is teasing you. I don’t consider encountering this archetype the same as encountering the entities. 
>  
> The mirror is a representation of ones emotional state. It is essentially a psychic feedback amplifier If you are happy and full of love this place can match and amplify your feelings. Unfortunately it also works the other way where darkness can become blackness and chaos becomes terror. You can use the mirror to give an honest self audit of how you are feeling “deep down”. We often suppress much more stress than we realize that we aren’t addressing. The hallucinations which are encountered here can be useful if approached correctly and analyzed honestly. 
> 
> **Stage Two, At The Gate:**
> This is where you will go if you have sufficient momentum for a breakthrough but are apprehensive, or didn’t take enough, or are not in the correct set and setting. It may be possible to glimpse into the bright world from here however you are not allowed in. It is usually manifested as a central distinct geometric structure compared to the background chaos. Often this structure is being approached at high speeds during stage one.
> 
> **Stage Three, The Bright World:**
> Only having been here three times it’s hard to say much. It’s exactly as high fidelity and weird as everyone reports. There are entities which can interact with you. It is a completely distinct space from the one wherein stages one and two occur. I suspect the energy here is also dependent on one’s state of mind however I have yet to experience that. I underwent two energetic surgeries here and don’t believe it actually healed anything. 
> 
> **Stage Four, One With Everything, “Be careful”:**
> If someone were to approach me and ask to do DMT, I would aim their experience well below this stage. This is likely a dose dependent effect so you’ll only have to deal with this if you really push it. I wish there were words to express how deeply serious and confusing achieving this state is. This is the kind of shit people meditate in caves for thirty years to experience and to just recklessly stumble into it was an exceedingly irresponsible move on my part. This permanently altered my personality in a neutral to positive way. 
> 
> Before I experienced this whole ego death thing it was hard to take the sheer gravity of the experience very seriously. I had psychedelic experiences for eight years at respectable frequencies and nothing even comes close to it. Please do not take high doses lightly. 
> 

**Reality of the DMT Experience and Reflection:**
> I am a scientist by training and practice. All of the experiences which can occur on this drug are well within the realms of existing brain wiring signaling in unusual ways. I am not a neuroscientist and have an understanding of neurology limited to a few really cool classes I took for fun as an undergraduate. My explanation below is purely speculation.
> 
> There are parts of our brain that tell us that a rock is not alive when we are looking at it. Either the same or another (probably related) part also tells us that a dog is alive when we look at a dog. Whatever circuitry that is responsible for the ability to make those distinctions can be made to act strangely.  When you encounter the DMT entities this is the circuitry which is responsible for the perception of them being fully alive, distinct beings. 
> 
> That being said, the spiritual and  emotional implications of these experiences have been completely life changing. I am definitely better off because I had these experiences. They were nothing short of coming in direct contact with the divine. 
> 
> Just because a hallucination is caused by a drug, does not make it less important. Chemical induction does not make something less powerful nor make the experience at a lower level than a more traditional approach to spiritual experiences. 
> 
> We are all fundamentally the same and love is the most important aspect of the soul. 
> 
> Also one time on LSD I opened my third eye and that was super weird but that’s another story. If you read this whole thing, or even parts of it, thank you.

"DMT showed me i was ill.
DMT trip report= hi guys, I just wanted to tell you guys about this trip i had....fukin crazy, ok so i rolled up about 40mg of Dream Sand in with some weed in a joint, put the fam. to sleep and went out to my back yard to smoke, i lit up and began hittin it, about 3 quarter way thru and  I was there man, reality diluted right in front of me, but no rapid geo patterns it was just yellow, and there was a being that was twirling and dancing like Michael Jackson and had on that white suite with that hat...no face...but totally reminded me of MJ, and he stopped twirling and pointed to my chest, i looked down and could see my insides lit up like all my skeleton, veins and at the bottom of my esophagus where the food valve is was an ugly red jewel looking thing.

iv had heartburn problems my whole life but nothing out of the regular, ive been postponing my scope with my doctor since forever, and after my DMT experience well that was the first thing i did was make a doctors appointment.

I went in the morning was pretty nervous and got threw it.....well when i awoke from the anesthesia the doctor told me you have to quit smoking, drinking and change your diet asap you have a bleeding hernia in your stomach food valve, take care!!!

for about 2 months now i have been micro-dosing Psilocybin, going to the gym, and have switched to an 75% plant based diet and induldge in a little bit of meat I am not perfect guys.....i feel fuking great and really wanted to share.

Thanks.

"A bit shaken after open-eyed breakthrough dose
I had never taken dmt previously, so understandably i felt the anxiousness of jumping into a dark lake not knowing how deep the water is. i didn’t really know what to expect, but what i experienced i feel like i have to share because it’s been weighing on my mind heavily these past couple weeks. 

around 2 weeks ago me and a friend got about a g, and we had never done it before. we idiotically hadn’t researched much about it before tripping because we didn’t want any previous knowledge to skew what we experienced. we loaded about 50mg into a vaporizer and i was the first to go. we were in his room with Alt-J playing on a speaker and a rainbow LED light going through the colors of the rainbow, so it was good vibe setting.

 i torched the vaporizer and watched as it melted and bubbled and took the whole thing in one hit. the moment it left my lips i had to hand it to my buddy because i was fucking blasting off. i instantaneously forgot i smoked dmt. the first thing i noticed was the sound of the singing in the background became heavily distorted and a great vibration came over me. i felt as if my consciousness was being thrown and tumbled through a tesseract of color. i knew for sure i was dead. and then blank. i was in a place that was light but dark, empty but full, it was a void seemingly empty of all space but somehow contained everything that had ever existed. and i was that void(?) i felt like i was everything, and nothing, and i went on for eternity, and that was the thing, the answer, what actually IS real, god i guess you could say. it was so familiar. my friend says i was unresponsive with my eyes open for this part which lasted about 3 minutes. 

after i regain exposure to the room i’m in, everything is literally that of an alex gray painting. my friend is orange and alien-like and has a yellow aura radiating from him. everything around me is very heavy on orange and yellow and little greens and blues. 

at this point i get stuck in a thought loop, looking down at the trash can thinking i’m going to vomit, seeing the QT logo and trying to use that to grip onto reality with some sense, looking at the door to his room because part of me knows QT is that way (i think my ego was fighting for its life lol) and then looking at my friend and asking a series of “who am i?” “am i dead?” “what’s happening to me?” “what did i take?”, and whatever he answered with, i didn’t understand him. i did this loop about 5 times according to him but it felt like eternity to me and only added to the sense that i was dead.

i broke out of the loop by looking into the bathroom and seeing myself in the mirror, my face was covered in what looked like tribal tattoos. i looked over at the bed and thought i should lay down. i was now in my body with a sense of self again, but i was so overwhelmed with amazement i couldn’t wrap my head around it. it was as if we had teleported his room into another dimension. everything was so glossy and round and gooey. i looked at my hands and they were small, i had no wrinkles or tattoos, my skin was perfect, and i looked at my legs and they were tiny, i felt like a gnome and my friend looked like one too. everywhere in my body felt numb as if i was on K or a heavy anesthesia. my face would melt into the pillow and the pillow would melt into me, i would look at my friend and i would indescribably become him, like i melted into him but not physically. i kept asking how he wasn’t seeing or feeling this. there was soft piano music and everything was waves of blue and purple and white lights. it was blissful. 

i slowly came down until i was once again sober, and decided i would try it again but a lower dose. i got the same sense of time being manipulated fast and then slow and everything melting into each other and repeating forever. it once again felt very familiar. 

that is where i have trouble processing my feelings and experience. it was too familiar. i’ve felt this before and when i think hard enough, i can remember a time before i was born where i felt this. i don’t think that’s possible, it’s just how i feel and it’s almost unexplainable. i feel like i know what it’s like to die and what happens after and what the underlying mechanics of things really are and it’s really fucking with me. i keep trying to rationalize it as just a drug effecting my brain and whatever i took from it was just my brain trying to process the experience but i can’t kick that gut feeling that it’s all too familiar and i’ve been through this many times before.

i hope you enjoyed the read and if you’ve had any experience or advice or have the same feeling i’d love to hear what you guys have to say

much love",1

I don't really know where to put this story, but you guys seem pretty chill. 

Back when I was in 3rd grade, my best friend was a girl. We did literally everything together. At lunch, recess, and in the classroom we would just hang out and talk.  Close to the end of the year, she asked if I wanted to be her boyfriend. I said ""sure, as long as it doesn't affect our friendship."" 

Well that relationship lasted about a week, because she said ""I love you."" Now I was raised pretty prudishley, and I told her that we didn't know what love was. I turned her away for expressing her feelings. Even though I did love her, and I wanted to be her boyfriend, I was always told that young kids don't understand love. 

We drifted apart, and eventually I graduated high school. I haven't talked to her in years, but I still remember what an awesome friend she was to me when no one else really was. 

She died this morning in a car accident. 17 years old. Slipped up on an icy road. 

I guess what I want to say is, I had an epiphany. 

Love is love, no matter what age. Don't turn the people you care for away just because they use some word. I know how I felt, she knew how she felt. But she said the ""L"" word. 

Loving people shouldn't be shameful. it should be encouraged. Love is in short supply in today's world. Don't be afraid of expressing it. ",0

"My first and accidental DMT trip led me on a month long journey to south America where my visions manifested.
My day started on the farm (Marijuana grow op). Andy and i had been wrapping up the season and the plan for the day was to unwind at a neighbors house with some friends. We took some amazing LSD-25, watched documentaries, and talked all day. 

Cut to: Andrew and i arrive back at the farmhouse after a nice trip. I am stoking the fire, Andrew is smoking a bowl of weed. The fire is burning nicely so i turn around to head for the couch. I see Andrew melting what i thought was shatter (THC extract) onto a bowl. he then says “Do you want to blast off?” The question that will stick with me forever and then some time after that. “Yes” no hesitation. keep in mind, In my head i was about to smoke some nice marijuana extract. Andrew handed me the bowl and started to direct me on how to smoke it. “you don’t want to touch the flame directly on the bowl. you want to kinda wave the flame above”… i interrupt because of course i know how to smoke some weed and although i interrupted i still kept in mind what he said. Thank Goodness i did because now i know i smoked the correct way where i could easily have ruined it and not had the following experience with DMT. 

The moment i exhaled this very long and slow rip, the smoke lingering in front of my face turning into a serpent-like being, glaring at me until the world around me vibrated into blackness. At this moment i said to myself “holy shit I’m dead” i was so instantly sure of what happened to me, i died. and almost as if there never was blackness to begin with so many colors and patters appeared before me. it was beautiful but i was terrified, i mean…i just died. Every new color and shape terrified me more and more. i was so scared for myself but at the same time i didn’t even know who “me” was. i remember thinking this over and over “I’m dead but who was i to begin with?” i couldn’t remember who i was and as a result i would feel this dark feeling of despair and loneliness. 

finally I had a moment where i grasped onto who i was before this journey started and in this terrified space i had a realization. All my life i have been wondering what’s next after this existence on earth. growing up I was force-fed christianity with a notion of this fantastical heavenly realm. Of course in my adult years i question my upbringing and ultimately my mortality. This was my chance. To find out what was next and experience it. It was time to take on this next life with ease. In an instant the same colors and patterns that were terrifying me were now comforting, astounding, and teaching me. This arena of impossible colors and shapes went from a negative space to a space of learning and comfort. 

after some time, questions, and answers. The patters somehow turned into what seemed like an infinite wall of arms with huge hands that were every color of the rainbow and I’m sure more. As soon as i saw the wall of arms i knew they were there to comfort me and in that moment of embrace i felt an ineffable happiest. The colorful arms disappeared and i was in this all white space, void of anything but i still had the feeling of bliss. I then heard a crowd of people cheering and, what i like to call, 'geometric-confetti’ burst into existence in all directions. I can only relate it to the big bang. This was my big bang. The cheering will always stick with me because it was so specific. Like i could pinpoint that exact cheer somehow from others. i felt the most love and acceptance i had ever felt. I was right where i was meant to be. I was ready to be there forever but all too soon my new home, My world that i was so ready to be apart of was gone. I retuned to my body. I returned to “me” I hadn’t opened my eyes yet but i knew that i was Alive. I was actually hugging myself as if i were the rainbow arms in that realm. I had the biggest grin on my face and i audibly said to myself “Ayampe”.  Ayampe is a small beach town in Ecuador that my sister had briefly mentioned to me months prior. I was so sure that this place was of importance to me but at the same time i was so confused as to why. It was only a name to me. Why was it so persistent in my mind? 

When i finally opened my eyes the room was familiar but every object seemed to be changing shape, size, and physical makeup. I would look at the dutch oven in the corner and it would change from steel to wood and then to plastic and then even velvet. It were as if objects in the room were cycling from other dimensions where the same objects were made of different material. eventually everything calmed down and i was completely back. But for a while the Residual high was intense. I used this time to study. 

Andy was asleep on the couch when i came back. Snoring away. Sitting straight up with one leg folded over the other. I wanted so badly to wake him up and get answers because holy shit... but i figured he probably followed suit after i went bye bye. I did’t want to wake him if his result from a trip was sleep. I had answers from the universe but now i needed answers from my friend so i waited. I couldn’t sleep. I could only wait for Andy to wake and when he did we had the longest conversation about what had happened. I now know that “blast off” is lingo and more importantly i crossed over during my first DMT trip. which he is still apologetic about. I am not. 

A couple days later the season of work is over and i head home to the bay area. It was christmas eve when i arrived home and one of the first things i did was buy a plane ticket to South America for 3 days later. I then followed this up with actual research on where i was going. I was entirely unprepared but i knew i had to go. i only knew of Ayampe because my sister was there and had mentioned a while back that i should come visit. To be honest I never had any intention in actually going. until my DMT trip of course. I spent christmas with family and the very next morning i was in a rideshare from craigslist on my way to los angeles. I spent two days in los angeles planning my trip with my sister over the phone and seeing some old friends from when i lived in the area. Dec 28th i set off to Ayampe, Ecuador where i was set to be spending the next month. 

My month in Ayampe was filled with an insane amount of adventure. Each moment leading to the next as if it were some serendipitous journey and i was this unworthy protagonist. Visions and sounds that i heard during my DMT trip would manifest in actual moments in my life and each time it blew me away. It would take a book to describe my month long adventure in Ayampe and how my DMT trip relates to it. But i’ll share something that really stuck with me. 

I went to a masseuse in town for a massage/reiki healing. I had never experienced reiki but i am always open to new things. After my amazing session Andrea, The Masseuse, asked me if she could please give me reiki training as a gift. She explained that my healing energy is intense and that i have to learn under her. While she was asking me to train with her i heard cheering from a crowd somewhere in the small town. The cheer was the exact same cheer i heard when i broke through. I heard the cheer and my mind flashed back to my trip as if i were back there. I couldn’t help but smile and eventually laugh because it was definitely the same cheer. I took this as a sign that i had to say yes. I started my week long training into level 1 reiki which was very powerful. At the end of the week it was time for level 1 graduation. 

Andrea set up an alter in the center of the training room. The alter consisted of many beautiful things but of course what stuck out to me instantly was the two long colorfully painted wooden hands. As soon as i walked in the room and saw the hands i flashed back to my trip again. back to the wall of colorful arms that were holding me. I was smiling and thinking “no fucking way…” over and over. I couldn’t stop thinking about the hands and then i said to myself “this is probably all just a coincidence.” and as soon as a had that shred of doubt, that very moment, i heard the cheering once more. The most overwhelming feeling of de ja vu hit me. There was no way this was a coincidence. I was meant to be there and to experience this training. At the end of the ceremony i was instructed to choose a card from the deck that was circling the perimeter of the alter. I chose the card of the goddess Flower. The card reiterated that i will heal people through my work with flowers. I grow marijuana and want nothing more than for everyone to learn of the healing properties of the plant. Everything just felt so right. Nothing was out of place. I was where i needed to be and i know that.

So many other experiences like my reiki lesson happened on my journey in south America. Moments hat would instantly flash me back to my DMT trip. Something was leading me on my adventure and i believe it to be something from hyperspace and i’ll be forever thankful for that. ",0

**The Egg**

**By: Andy Weir**

 

You were on your way home when you died.

It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.

And that’s when you met me.

“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”

“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”

“Yup,” I said.

“I… I died?”

“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.

You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”

“More or less,” I said.

“Are you god?” You asked.

“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”

“My kids… my wife,” you said.

“What about them?”

“Will they be all right?”

“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”

You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.

“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”

“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”

“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”

“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”

“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”

You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”

“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”

“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”

“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”

I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.

“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”

“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”

“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”

“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”

“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”

“Where you come from?” You said.

“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”

“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”

“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”

“So what’s the point of it all?”

“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”

“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.

I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”

“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”

“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”

“Just me? What about everyone else?”

“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”

You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”

“All you. Different incarnations of you.”

“Wait. I’m everyone!?”

“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.

“I’m every human being who ever lived?”

“Or who will ever live, yes.”

“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”

“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.

“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.

“And you’re the millions he killed.”

“I’m Jesus?”

“And you’re everyone who followed him.”

You fell silent.

“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”

You thought for a long time.

“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”

“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”

“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”

“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”

“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”

“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”

And I sent you on your way. ",0

"For first timers and anyone new to this Molecule.
There seems to be a huge influx of interest in DMT of late, with lots of posts from first time users who’ve not yet partaken. With this comes a ton of misinformation and bad advice. This forum has a lot of amazing and valuable advice- but it’s also full of reckless, bad advice. For new users, the difference isn’t at all clear. 

And the amount of bad trip reports is increasing exponentially along with this. 

To all the new folks- just be careful, be kind, and above all please respect yourself- by taking your time to prepare for this molecule. It’s like nothing you can imagine, so don’t try. As has been said before, it’s “more alien than alien.” This is not a scare post. I’m hoping for a more thoughtful approach and discussion. 

There is no comparison to anything, any experience, or any dream state that will help prepare you for this experience. Please do more than read this subreddit before trying this sacred molecule. 

Go into it with intention. Go into it with an open mind. Go into it with the understanding that it’s not for recreation or laughs. This can be a soul shattering experience, in the most beautiful or tragic ways, and it’s so important to understand its not something you can do passively and just keep going on as usual. It can change you.

If you’re very young, I’d implore you to wait until you’ve had more time to fully develop your ego- your sense of self and your place in this world. 

If you’re a experienced with other psychedelics and think you know what to expect, I’d implore you to shake this belief. Because either way, afterwards, you’ll understand there is no comparison. 

Be well and be kind. Take care of yourselves. I wish you all well on your journeys. Much love. ",1

So i loaded up the glass pipe melted it down and took a massive hit, the second my mouth left the pipe these incredible tingles went from my toes up to my brain which then felt like it exploded. My vision stopped whilst turning into weird shapes and spirals, there was no space between anything there was no individual objects but everything was connected even the feeling in my body at this point was just a wholeness with everything being one there was no me. I was then greeted by these blueish green figures that looked kind of like humans from some ancient tribe with all the swirls and patterns on the face and they showed me through this world of some extremely advanced technology speaking in some kind of electrical static language of clicks and pops. The feeling i had at that point was incredible it felt like i have been there for thousands and thousands of years which was extremely intimidating i felt like i knew so much but it was still so foreign its just too hard to put into words. I started floating back to my body at this point the peak was over there was so much more to it but there is just no explaining it,  i was able to open my eyes now but was still tripping hard and looking at this world in a completely different way, i looked at my cousin and his mate who were still disorientated trying to figure out what the fuck just crawled out of their brains we all just started laughing and hugging each other in pure bliss there was still no words at this point we were all just on the same level. That was the one most intense most amazingly beautiful experiences of my whole life, i have never felt anything so real.",1

"After hundreds of dmt trips, this is what I have experienced..
  Religion was never truly my thing. I was introduced to Islam, Christianity,  and Buddhism growing up. I always saw the underlying truth in many of them, but never liked the way they worked, almost like institutions of sorts. It didn’t align with my truth. I searched for my own truth. I even considered myself an atheist before. I remember tripping off of 10 hits of lsd regularly and absolutely losing my mind in the most profound way. The days of 5gs of shrooms brought me closer to other beings living on earth with me and a general sense of calmness. Dmt was definitely the strangest of the bunch. Smoking it was tough at first but once I mastered that (got a GVG) I was able to truly experiment with my consciousness that very few people ever could. What I’ve learned from hundreds of trips with DMT and most psychedelics (including 5-meo-dmt) is that we are all ONE being experiencing itself as everything.

What God is is what “I AM”. If you ever wanted to see what God truly looked like, all bullshit aside, just look into a mirror. That is the greatest realization any being in any universe/reality can ever have. That realization will bring you the biggest belly laugh you could never imagine, the belly laugh the fat Buddha statue is known for. The realization that the awareness/consciousness that YOU ARE is the same as the one I AM. And God is the imagination of both and everything else. After a couple hundred dmt trips the entities don’t appear so often and you go straight into the Godhead(Timothy Leary’s ‘The Psychedelic Experience’ describes the different levels interestingly), which is pure light/love/knowing/imagination all happening at once.  It is your home. You rest there experiencing lifetimes worth of knowledge, then you wake up in your current body/mind/soul complex what was only a few minutes in this dimension of reality. The wisdom stays with you in the core of your being, but you forget much of the experience soon after due to the noises of this reality in your mind. Knowing yourself as “that consciousness/awareness” that is everything will align you more properly with the truth and cut the noise out. ",0

"DMT as my first ever psychedelic; breakthrough report
As I was inhaling I felt a very familiar sensation come over my body; warmth and tingling. 
It was the most incredible feeling I'd ever felt. A feeling I like to describe as pure love. 

As I was exhaling I saw spirits fly out of mouth. I entered a completely different realm filled with geometrical patterns and something I can only describe as the feeling of remembering. I was experiencing a sensation that I was only able to comprehend within this spiritual realm, as the human brain does not hold the capacity to interpret such an experience. 

In real life I tried to speak to my trip sitter, But when I spoke it wasn't English. The words came out as gibberish and echoed through my brain before fading into a distant buzzing/energy sound.

When I tried to speak this wicked, evil tongue came out of my mouth. At this point I was well out of my body and into hyperspace. I could no longer see the room I was in, despite having my eyes open. I was completely immersed in these overwhelming visuals, sensations and alternate dimensions all at once. I was experiencing completely new concepts of time, space, gravity, and what I assume to be well beyond a 4th dimensional aspect. I couldn't just see, hear, feel, taste, and touch. There were more senses, ones I am mentally incapable of remembering or describing. English becomes completely obsolete when experiencing these profound sensations. I began to understand that language is merely a glimpse of human nature; which in itself is a fraction of the makeup of the universe. 

I tried to speak again and gibberish just poured out of my mouth. This time, I started to see hieroglyphics.  I saw symbols and every language to ever exist flash past my eyes and then become Completely obsolete. I then started seeing ancient Egyptians. It was like all of earth's history flashed past my eyes in a brief glimpse. From here it took me to a place that I will never be able to comprehend. It was at this moment that I experienced complete ego death and forgot I was a human and that earth even existed.

This was the deepest I was taken. It is beyond possible for me to ever recollect what happened in there. It was so foreign, and so unknown to human experience. 

My attention switched focus to a song that was playing, as I was being carried towards a light. Around me I felt the presence of other beings. I did not know who they were, and I could not see them. But I could feel them. It wasnt a good presence or a bad presence. I didn’t feel fear; but I didn’t feel peace. It was only neutral.  

By this stage I was no longer a conscious observer of my experience, everything was just simply happening. 

The being(s) were welcoming me home.

The song playing was the most beautiful song I’ve heard in my life. It was as though all songs that ever existed in all there beauty were merged into a single song of absolute blissful purity. The song had no lyrics, but I knew exactly what it was singing. There was a presence in the song inviting me home. It was talking to me. 

I knew this song. I was trying to remember what the song was called as it sounded like something I’d heard before, but I couldn’t remember where I knew it from.

As I began getting glimpses back to reality I was starting to panic as I was falling in and out awareness of who I am on earth. This place was as scarey as it was beautiful. I honestly wasn’t prepared enough for the experience, and I felt myself starting to resist a bit. I remember a strong feeling of regret for being there, and I realized that I had done this to myself. I knew with everything inside of me that this DMT “world” was not where I was suppose to be at this current time. I realized I was placed onto earth as a human being for a reason. And that earth is where I am suppose to be right now; simply experiencing whatever needs to be experienced. By inhaling this substance I was trying to control the understanding of my own existence, when the lesson was simply to **trust.** 

I became convinced that I would be stuck in this realm for years, completely isolated from my current life on earth before finally entering my body after endless fear and suffering. I thought this realm had collected me. At this point in time I remember begging my sitter to “make it stop” but he reminded me that I just had to go with it. 

I listened to him and as I surrendered to the experience my fear began to subside. It was no longer an endless loop of horrifying, utter despair. I continued to surrender to the fear and let it consume me, and as I accepted it, the fear stopped growing.
 
At this stage I started seeing green visuals looking at me from a thousand different angles in a thousand different dimensions. 
From here I started to come down a bit from the trip and regained full awareness I was a human. I remember looking around the room, then at my feet, where I suddenly felt as though I was in space. I was surrounded by transparent people; spirits with pure white glowing auras. 

I then looked over at my sitter and he turned into a 2d image, where his face was flat like a piece of paper and so was the rest of the world. I was constantly alternating between different dimensions… 2D, 3D, 4D etc. At one point I looked at my skin and I could see it aging in front of me. It was growing old, wrinkly and fading in color. I grabbed my sitters hand and I could physically see his skin aging along with mine. We kept aging from our young bodies into elderly within a matter of seconds, and then we kept getting older and older and older. Then older than human life. Older and older and older and then suddenly I was back in hyperspace; but with my sitter this time. We grew so old that we turned into a tree; but the same tree. And then I remembered him.

But not “earth” him. I could remember him from a time longer than I’m able to comprehend. I knew him. I missed him so much. I had been with him before at some point in time, but not like a relationship that humans have in this earth. It was a completely different connection with different universal principles. I didn’t know where I knew him from, but I knew with everything in my heart that we had been together before. At this point I started to ball my eyes out in real life, crying with so much joy and peace that we had been reunited.

This is all I remember from my trip before I finally reached my body again. I have added a picture below that most accurately describes how I felt being the same tree as my sitter.

I also recorded my trip (audio), where I recollected my trip and my experiences verbally during the come down when I was able to speak again (but still tripping). Although I do not remember a lot of what I was referring to when I spoke, I have decided to quote some of the conclusions I had made fresh from the comedown:


•	“I experienced every emotion at once. 
It was a bad trip but it was a good trip.
It was all of them at once.
It was every dimension, every universe, every time.
It was everything at once.
Every language; I could understand it all.
But it wasn’t verbal. 

You just had to feel it; just go with it
Every language was there all along
But we speak; in this universe we speak. We communicate
But its not like that out there, whatever it is. It was speaking to me in a different way.”

•“I could see every feeling, every pattern and every color at once.”
“I saw people from history.” 

•	“Im not scared of dying. I know it will make sense in the end but there’s a lot of scary stuff out there that I experienced. I was gone. It had me. It was so evil. But it didn’t consume me completely. It was only brief.”


[To my trip sitter] 

•	“You have a lot of arms.”

•	“you’re next to me but in me at the same time”

•	“Whatever I felt today was evil. But it didn’t show itself. It showed me it was there but it didn’t show me what it was. But whatever it is, is the most petrifying, disgusting, horrible feeling of human despair known to human kind. It did not show me this, but simply its presence. Its presence alone was fucking terrible. It showed me its potential; but I didn’t get consumed by it.

“I experienced a proportion of the bad and a proportion of the good.
I experienced both in between.
Like an equilibrium.
I experienced the middle of good and bad.”

Trip sitter (trying to interpret what I’m saying): “like yin and yang”

Me: “that’s why my socks are different colors. 
Pink and blue. Opposites; like the genders in this universe. “

"[TRIP REPORT] Insane - 1hr - DMT Breakthrough
**Psychedelic experience:**

*LSD* 15-20 trips ranging from *200ug - 400ug*.
*Mushrooms* 5-6 trips ranging from 2g - 8g.
*N02* roughly 150-200 hits.
*Ketamine* more bags than I can count.
*2-CB* a few trips, pretty warm experience.
*25-nBome* 1 or 2 trips - dirtier version of LSD, bad comedown and puking at high doses (which are needed for solid effects, I've heard). Pretty strong trips though. ~ 700ug - 900ug.

**First DMT experience**

After a hard trip at the festival my girlfriend and I were too scatter-brained to attempt smoking DMT, and we decided we would get more from the experience after a good night rest.

Two days later, back at home and well rested, we set up the bedroom for our trip. Himalayan rock salt multicolour LED lamps. Crystals organized neatly into a shrine - circle around them. Psychedelic artwork on the walls.

I go first. I lay down and pack the cone, we had the changa, chopped with a little bit of bud to thin it down.

**WARNING** I don't condone the use of illicit substances. I had done plenty of research before trying this and this report is for educational purposes.

The first thing I feel is the bed drop from underneath me, I was instantly floating. Numb to the senses my body was experiencing. I saw mandalas, patterns and 4D shapes. Colors that are beyond the natural spectrum, and this hum.

*What I can only describe as a* **cosmic hum** piercing through each atom of my being. All audible senses from my body are scattered - as if the nerves containing the data where running in slow motion.

Each breath was like a slow wave rolling into the shore. Intense blackness, but also an intense brightness.

I did not break through. 

**My 2nd DMT experience**

After a house-party in the city, I had decided to try DMT again. Stocking up at the party, I got twice the dose the I had on my first trip. 250mg of changa

It was enough for 3 big bongs worth. Enough to break through. 

*My first hit came as a surprise.* I remember it being intense but not this intense. My face went numb. My hands and feet tingled and pulsed as the blood run through them. I could feel every cell in my body. I was whole and one, but separate.

All of a sudden I felt a wind on my face. I was rushing past something, like a tunnel of light. Pure white light, but through it was a rainbow of impossible colors that flashed and spun.

I saw every letter, number, symbol and hieroglyph created by man. I saw how language ties together our human perspective, and how reality can be shifted using thoughts and ideas created through the gift of language.

I saw every pattern, mandala, mathematics, fractals, I saw the essence and geometry that holds life together. Calculations deeper and more profound than the Fibonacci sequence or the flower of life.

**Then I had my 2nd cone** and everything tore apart at the seams. Reality itself split and I could see another world behind it. For some reason it felt like this was the ""true world"" and that the world I was leaving was just an imagined place. I've read a lot about people feeling like they've ""returned home"" and stuff, so I guess you could relate it to that. 

I was launched through the tunnel and into a mirage of 4D objects layed out like a city.

I can't describe much if it, other than that it was incredible scenery that went on for millions of miles. 

I remember there being entities. Very similar to some DMT artwork I have seen online:
http://i.imgur.com/M64wyOd.jpg

I've seen people describe these as machine elves but I didn't get much contact with them so I can't say.

At one point there were about 5 or 6 of them leaning towards me, all eyes on me like I had been missing for ages and they were surprised I was there. 

They showed me things I can't describe, one of the less mind-bending ones was a triangular-cube. Like a 4th dimensional cube that had 3 sides on one of the dimensions?

I know it doesn't make much sense so here's a gif:
https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XPVXW-sAqwflZSBj4BNdrKL0nFA29VweE5l-0JXZhP3yZFU4_odaK2bXZUHCBKCxoxWQtRqbAeNn7J3cYoMNAvdUJv7XnQkhIST3X3_3O3O3S_s5BHM=w252-h252-nc

The beings themselves would warp in and out of the dimensions like that too. Constantly rotating on a 4th axis that was neither X, Y, nor Z.

I asked one of them ""Where do spirit beings come from?"" and got a reply in glossolalia. I wish I could have understood, it sounded like Latin or some other language but I knew his words carried depth and knowledge. They were thought out, slow in pace and pronounced with diction.

Although I didn't know much about my new world I'd arrived at, for some reason I had an extensive knowledge on our 3D reality. 

I knew where we came from, how we evolved. I could see how societal standards change over time and how wars could be prevented. 

I knew the deepest part of human psyche. I was all. I had no knowledge of myself as an individual. 

Humanity tied in with these new friends that were surrounding me, attent and intrigued with me.

I knew they could read my thoughts too, almost like how you can feel somebody watching you. They were interested in how excited I got with the new experience.

Slowly but surely my memories came back. I have work in the morning. Work? Oh yeah.

I remember what I look like. I remember my girlfriend. I remember my life and all my mistakes and shortcomings. I'm shown my entire life from start to finish in the blink of an eye. 

And then boom. It all goes. And I'm back in the present. Staring at my curtains, slightly waving still from the hallucinogens.


**EDIT:**
It's the morning after - still a bit groggy, slept through my first alarm for work but managed to drag myself out of bed for the second. After writing my post *(finishing around 3.30am this morning or whenever I posted)* I still didn't fall asleep until about 4.30am - was too lucid and introspective. I thought about my trip and recalled moments that I had not written down here.

At one point, all the entities who were communicating to me were gone. I was in a strange grey-white room that had ripples of color going through the walls - which looked like they were melting.
There were about 10-12 of these little 'puffle' things I decided to call them.

They were cute and had charm and charisma - but lacked any formal knowledge from what I could tell. They were like the lower-class animals of this realm. They stole my breath. No kidding - I felt them jumping in and out of my chest *(an experience Terrance McKenna has spoken about a couple times)*. They would take a piece of my breath right out of my lungs and then jump out again. As if it were some shiny object that I had brought to them as a present. When I had no more to give - they stopped and went back to dancing around and causing shenanigans.

Some went back to the larger entities - where they were consumed and then all of a sudden I had a telepathic connection with the larger beings again. Who looked like this:

**Another thing I noticed** was that they showed me images of my life. Before I mentioned I saw my entire future, past, present, etc all mashed together - but most of it was actually images of my girlfriend - I saw us grow old together and all that cheesy stuff, but I also saw all the bad times and how in the end everything levels out. The good, the bad, the happy, funny, excruciating pain, intense love. I felt every feeling at once, and because of this, I also felt neutral. I wasn't calm, I wasn't panicked either, I was just neutral and all knowing - in a state of pure existence. And then like I said - boom - I was rushed back into the present, back into my body and left confused. :P

I just want to say that I had always assumed the whole ""hippy"" thing was silly with all the love and free spirit and whatnot (what I truly assumed at the time) was bullshit. 
I'm in my early thirties and had never tried psychedelics (smoked marijuana once in my early twenties) and just always focused on my career and was never into spirituality. 
After a lot of talking with a close friend who's done psilocybin he convinced me to try it and I went ahead with it with an open mind.  
During the trip, I was talking with him and I realized I sound and feel like a hippy - but although the word itself had a negative connotation I realized how stupid and silly -I- was, not them. The connection, love, peace, contentment and beauty you feel was indescribable. 
I finally understood that loving nature, being good to each other, taking care of each other and our world etc. is the only thing that's real. It's everyone else that's living in this manufactured competitive state of society that's fake. It's almost like over generations we've suppressed who we truly are to the point that we ostracize and ridicule those who know the truth without giving them a chance to see their side.
As I'm writing this I feel weird...I feel like that negative stereotype of a ""hippy"". It's so ingrained in us that even when we experience the truth it's still hard to shed what years of societal indoctrination has done.  
Anyways, I never imagined myself thinking like this but I'm glad I have - After some research I'd like to go on an ayahuasca trip next and explore this new world. I'll stop now or I can keep going on and on but I just felt like sharing. ",1

THE DOSE

DMT 30-40mg 
(I only have scales with 0.001 resolution and reading was flicking between these values)

PREVIOUS PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES:

Cannabis.
Psilocybin truffles in Amsterdam (10g psilocybin tampanensis)
4g magic mushrooms.
Morning glory seeds (quite a light trip)
I had smoked DMT 2 times before, but in these occasions I didn’t have accurate scales and i “diddled the dose” only achieving threshold effects on both occasions.
I meditate often.

MENTAL PREP THE DAY BEFORE:

Also the day before i smoked DMT. I went to Stonehenge for winter solstice to watch the sunrise, then had an hour sensory deprivation tank, then an 8 hour over night gong bath. To prepare myself mentally.

(In hindsight I don’t think anything can prepare you)

THE EXPERIENCE:

I lay on my bed holding my vapour genie, taking practice drags with no DMT to ensure the ceramic filter was hot enough to vaporise all the DMT in a single hit. My heart was beating incredibly fast and my hands were shaking. I stop took a few deep breathes loaded up the vape. I paused before applying the flame and took a long deep inhale. I was immediately struck by just how much smoke I inhaled. “Hold it in” I thought as thick smoke started pouring into my lungs. 

I soon felt overwhelmed, I could hold no longer and relaxed my lungs a thick plume of smoke exited my body.

As I was exhaling I felt huge rush and a crackling noice filled my ears. My vision went all fuzzy, everything in my room started vibrating like crazy, I lay down and BANG.

PART 1:

Visions: 
The most vivid intense hallucinations started pouring over me. They slowly blended with the room, until the room went away and I was in another very cartoonish reality. I remember the visions being an incredible blue and yellow colour, with these figures standing all around me. They didn’t try communicate with me they were just there.

Thoughts:
As I was loosing conscious connection with reality, I suddenly felt the presence of my parents, they were both around me, something had gone wrong....
I remember trying to convey something to my dad, telling him I was fine I had just smoked DMT, I wasn’t going to die. But the DMT swallowed me up and I could do nothing to communicate with them.

[note: my parents were out]

The DMT realm swallowed me up and my old life on Earth, family, friends were soon forgotten. I was sure I had died and had no recollection of even existing. It was the most odd weird sensation ever. It was the weirdest experience that had ever happened to me. Even though I am using words to describe it, they do not come close to describing the most weird emotions I was feeling.


PART 2:

I have almost no recollection of what happened here. I remember fragments, a bit like only having a few pieces from a jigsaw puzzle. It felt like I was somewhere very real, very important but most weirdly it was very very familiar. Like I had been there thousands of times, more familiar than my room at home. I can’t say much more than that.

PART 3:

It was starting to feel like I had been in the DMT realm forever. However slowly but surely I started to remember small parts of my life and wondered wether it would ever return. Had I just made it up? I had no idea. If had existed then how did I end up in this State? Surely I was dead or at the very least unable to return? Then a curious thing happened 3 letters started circling my mind D M T. Although I had no idea what the significance of them was. It was a bit like reading a new internet acronym, where you have no idea of the significance of the letters, with the added complexity that the acronym is scrambled. T D M M T D D M T (what did these letters signify?). DMT. DMT. I had just smoked DMT, it suddenly started make sense. I opened my eyes I saw my room, I was not dead. My whole room morphed around me, the figure in my poster by my bed was swirling around my vision. At this point I said to myself “I’m completely sober, I’m back, phew” even though I was still tripping far harder than 4gs of magic mushrooms. The fact that I had any connection at all with reality was reassuring. I picked up my pipe and put it in the draw next to my bed.

I closed my eyes and suddenly I was back albeit briefly. Imagery poured all over me. I then got up. All around me my room was the exact same as I left it. How curious.  The curtains were drawn my cat was still asleep on my arm chair in the exact same position. It just seemed so weird that I had just under gone the most intense experience of my life and yet the world outside was unchanged. About 15 mins had passed since I took the first hit. WOW I thought. Holy fuck that was insane. I had no idea of what to make of it. I felt I could now walk around. I heard my brother playing human by the killers. The music sounded ever so slightly distorted. I was still high. My brother passed me I gave him a hug and then proceeded to stare out my window into my garden for a while. It was hard to process what had happened. I went for a walk outside.

AFTER THOUGHTS:

It is extremely hard to accurately describe any of it. The experience is beyond words, beyond language, time stands still. Even your body and mind cease to exist. You are nothing. You don’t exist yet you go somewhere more familiar than your own house or even your own fingers. It was too much to process. Next time I’ll try a lower dose.

"eCig DMT: A Comprehensive Guide
I've had *tremendous* success vaping DMT in an eCig device, and I honestly think this is the most foolproof ROI available. Here's an in-depth guide on how it's done:

# An eCig Overview 

## The Mod

A vape **mod** is the core of an eCig (called a ""mod"" because in the early days of vaping, enthusiasts who wanted more power than the commercial ""pens"" provided would *modify* high power flashlights). This might also be referred to as a ""battery"" or simply a ""vape"".

You can get **Unregulated Mods**, which simply provide a switched connection between the battery and the coil, and **Regulated Mods**, which use semiconductors to control the voltage/wattage applied. I *highly* recommend a regulated mod for vaping DMT, as unregulated ones require a much more extensive knowledge of the relationship between volts, watts, and amps to be used safely.

Inexpensive eCig devices (sometimes called ""vape pens"" or ""eGo mods"") don't provide enough power to create the thick vapor that a DMT breakthrough requires. ***Look for a device that provides a minimum of 40 to 50 watts.***

Some mods use an internal battery that charges via USB, while others use one, two, or three removable **18650 batteries.** These are ""high discharge"" batteries, and they deserve a great deal of respect (people have been seriously injured by exploding 18650s). Batteries should be rated for a minimum of 20 Amps of output when discharged, and they should be treated carefully and always kept in an insulated case when not in use. If the plastic wrap on a battery is nicked or cracked, it should be replaced (many vape shops will re-wrap a battery for a small fee). While most removable-battery devices support USB charging, I recommend an external charger, which will have better protection circuitry. I prefer removable-battery devices, and ***I use either LG HG2 or Samsung 25R batteries***. You can avoid the hassle of 18650s if you prefer by ***getting an internal-battery device.***

Most modern mods support at least two modes: **Variable Wattage**, in which power is applied to the coil continuously as long as the button is pressed (allowing the coil to get progressively hotter), and **Temperature Control** (often abbreviated **TC**), in which the mod maintains a user-selected temperature. This can make the DMT experience much more foolproof, so ***look for a mod that supports TC.***, and ideally one that can use Nickel, Titanium, and Stainless Steel coils (more on those in a minute).

#### Mod TL/DR: Get one that provides a minimum of 40 Watts and that supports Temperature Control, with your choice of either an internal or a removable battery. I'm currently using the Joyetech eVic-VTC Mini and the Joyetech Cuboid, and can highly recommend both (they are nearly identical in function, differing only in the number of batteries they use and the amount of power they can output).

## The Atomizer

The combination of a *coil* and a *wick* that atomizes (vaporizes) a liquid so that it can be inhaled. Atomizers fall into two general categories: **Drippers** and **Tanks**.

A Dripper is usually referred to as an **RDA** (Rebuildable Dripping Atomizer). It has posts with screws to hold a coil, which you must build and wick yourself (more on that in a minutes). To vape, you remove a cap, drip your juice onto the coil/wick, replace the cap, and go. You can usually get 5 to 10 hits before the wick is dry, at which point you need to re-drip.

Tanks typically hold anywhere from 2ml to 5ml of liquid, and come in two varieties: **RTAs** (Rebuildable Tank Atomizers), and tanks with **pre-built factory coils** that can be swapped out as needed. Either of these will work when vaping DMT.

A tank with pre-built coils is going to be the easiest option for someone new to eCigs. Just remember to choose coils that have a low resistance (under 1 ohm) so that they will produce enough vapor, and get a tank that supports coils made with Nickel, Titanium, or Stainless Steel so that it will work in TC. Be aware, too, that many tanks may leak slightly, depending on the viscosity of the liquid in them (more on that when we talk about making your juice), so there's a risk of losing some of your precious spice.

Both rebuildable options (RDA and RTA) have the advantage of being cheaper over time (wire and cotton cost less than factory-built coils), at the cost of requiring some degree of handiness (you need to build and wick the coils).

An RDA will be entirely leak-proof, as you'll only need to drip the amount of liquid that you want to vape in a single session (at the cost of some convenience, obviously—if you're tripping with multiple people, it can be a hassle to re-drip between users).

An RTA *can* be leak-proof if it is wicked properly, but that can require some trial-and-error. But in my opinion nothing beats the convenience of having a tank of DMT-juice ready to go whenever I feel like I'm ready for a trip—or to pass around when I'm tripping with friends, without having to worry about re-dripping.

#### Atomizer TL/DR: Decide whether you want to build your own coils or not. If not, get a tank that uses pre-built coils (I can't provide recommendations, unfortunately, as it's been a year or more since I've used one of these). If you *do* want to build, decide whether you want to drip (again, can't provide recommendations) or use a tank. I am personally **in love** with my Sigelei Moonshot—it's fairly easy to build, hasn't leaked a bit, and hits like a dream.

## A Bit About Temperature Control

Temperature Control works by constantly reading the resistance of the coil as the mod is fired (the button is pressed). Many metals will become more resistant to current as they heat up, and by reading the change the mod can cut power when it determines the desired temperature has been reached, then pulse it as needed to maintain that temperature.

Nearly all TC mods work with **Nickel** and **Titanium** coils, and most newer ones work with **Stainless Steel** as well. Many will also allow you to set a custom **TCR** (Temperature Coefficient of Resistance—the rate at which resistance changes with a change in temperature). A fourth metal that is commonly used in vaping is **Kanthal**, which is an allow specifically engineered to *not* fluctuate in resistance as it heats up. Kanthal is, therefore, not suitable for TC.

Each of the three TC metals (nickel, titanium, stainless steel) has its advantages: Nickel has a much higher TCR, so the mod's temperature estimates are more accurate. Stainless Steel has the lowest TCR of the three, and Titanium is somewhere in the middle. But both Nickel and Titanium can produce harmful oxides when overheated. For this reason, I choose to use Stainless Steel exclusively, even though TC is not quite as accurate with Stainless.

## Building Coils (RDA/RTA)

In a nutshell, you wrap the wire of your choice (I use Stainless Steel) around something (a small screwdriver works—somewhere in the 2.5mm to 3.5mm range is usually about right) to create a spring-like coil, and then you screw each end of the coil into the terminals on your RDA or RTA build deck. Search YouTube for countless tutorial videos if this doesn't make sense. Many RDA/RTAs these days actually support two coils.

Before wicking, screw the atomizer onto your mod. The mod will read the resistance and display it—ideally you'll want it somewhere in the 0.3 ohm to 0.7 ohm range. If it's too low, you can increase the resistance by using a thinner wire, or by adding more wraps. If it's too high, you can reduce the resistance by using a thicker wire, or using fewer wraps.

If using Stainless Steel, with the mod in Wattage mode, pulse-fire it (press the button for half a second, release for half a second, and repeat) until the wire glows an even bright red. Ideally it will heat from the center outward. If using Nickel or Titanium, **DO NOT** heat the wire to red, as this will produce harmful oxides. Instead, in a very dark room, pulse until you see a very faint glow—just enough to determine that the wire is heating evenly. 

After allowing the wire to cool, a length of cotton (organic, unbleached) is then threaded through the coil(s). It should be tight enough that there's a slight bit of resistance when it's pulled through, but not so tight that it deforms the coil. The cotton is trimmed to length, and its ends are placed on the deck (for an RDA) or into ""juice channels"" (for an RTA). There are numerous YouTube tutorials for wicking as well.

If using an RDA, saturate the cotton, put the cap on, and you're ready to go!

If using an RTA, saturate the cotton, reassemble the tank, fill the tank full of juice, and then wait a minute or two for any possible dry spots in the cotton to absorb the juice.

I *highly* recommend thoroughly testing your setup using a juice with the same VG/PG ratio (see next section) that you'll be using for your DMT juice. This is especially important with an RTA, as they can often be a little fiddly when it comes to wicking—too loose, and the tank will leak, too tight, and it won't be able to wick the juice fast enough, making for an unsatisfying experience (and, if you aren't using TC, a lungful of scorched cotton!).

# Let's Make the Juice!

## eLiquid Basics

The basic components of eCig juice are **Propylene Glycol** and **Vegetable Glycerin**, plus flavorings and (possibly) nicotine.

Propylene Glycol (PG) is an excellent flavor carrier. It's also fairly thin at room temperature, produces a relatively thin vapor, and hits fairly harshly on the throat when vaporized.

Vegetable Glycerine (VG) produces a dense, thick vapor that is quite smooth on the throat. It is viscous at room temperature, and it doesn't carry flavor nearly as well as PG does.

Most commercial eCig juices these days are heavier on VG and lighter on PG—the bottle will generally list a ratio, e.g. ""30/70"". Unless otherwise indicated, the larger number is usually the VG percentage, and the smaller the PG percentage. Some juices will be labelled ""Max VG"", which indicates that the only PG present is the small amount found in the flavorings that were used.

For the purpose of vaping DMT, I recommend somewhere between 50 and 70% VG. I've found that DMT dissolves better in PG, so a Max VG juice is not ideal, but a juice that is more PG than VG will be much more prone to leakage (not an issue if you're using an RDA), and VG can increase the viscosity of the juice enough to avoid this.

You can use a commercial bottle of juice in whatever flavor you want. I recommend getting a juice *without* nicotine (it will be listed as ""0 Nic"", or ""0 mg/ml""). Alternately, you can buy both PG and VG very inexpensively on Amazon if you'd prefer to mix your own.

**Pro tip**: A juice with a small amount of menthol will be a *lot* smoother on the throat, which can be helpful when trying to take massive breakthrough hits.

## The Process

Weigh out your DMT, and then measure out your purchased eCig juice, or a combination of VG and PG. I make my juice as follows:

* 1g crystal DMT
* 2 ml PG
* 2 ml VG
* A couple of drops of menthol

If you're using commercial juice, use 4ml per 1g of DMT. I find that with this ratio I can consistently break through with two moderate hits from my vape. If you want to be able to break through in a single hit, you could adjust the ratio to make the juice more potent. Personally, I like the added control I get with a less-concentrated juice—if my first hit is particularly massive and I feel like I'm almost there, I can take a smaller second one and still break through. Plus it's less tragic when I accidentally spill a drop of juice, as I'm losing less DMT per drop.

Combine all the ingredients in a small glass container set in some warm water to help the DMT dissolve. Stir until mixed well. This should take less than a minute. The juice will likely be a yellowish color, and relatively clear.

**Optional**: I often see tiny flecks of what I assume are plant fats that managed to hitch a ride when I ran the extraction. I filter these out by placing a small amount of paper coffee filter in a 10ml syringe and forcing the juice through it (using the syringe plunger) to get a pristine-clear (but still yellow) juice.

Put the juice in a small bottle, or directly in your tank. A syringe with a blunt needle can be very helpful in getting every drop out of your mixing container. (You could, I suppose, mix directly in the bottle if you're using a glass dropper bottle...)

# Here We Go!

It's time to blast off! Attach your atomizer to your mod, and if you're using an RDA, saturate the wick with your DMT juice.

Put your mod in TC mode, and set your temperature to somewhere around 520°F (260°C). Some mods allow you to set the wattage in TC mode. This will affect how quickly the coil reaches the desired temperature. I set mine at 45W, and my coil heats up nearly instantly. Some mods don't give you precise wattage control, but allow you to select the ""hardness"" of the hit (with options like ""Soft"", ""Normal"", and ""Hard"")—I recommend using the ""hardest"" setting available.

 If your atomizer has an airflow control ring, adjust it so that it takes a couple of seconds to get a lungful of air (do a test inhale *without* pressing the button).

Get comfortable, and take a couple of slow, deep breaths. Start your playlist, if you want music to direct your trip.

Now take a hit, holding the fire button down until your lungs are about 2/3 full, then releasing it *while continuing to inhale* (to make sure you capture any vapor that is produced when the coil is still hot in the moments after the power is cut). Hold for a slow count to 15, then exhale—there should be very little visible vapor, and you should already be starting to feel the effects.

Repeat a second time, and if you've done everything right, you'll be in hyperspace before you finish your second count to 15! If not, feel free to take a third hit. =) 

# Conclusion

I really hope that you find this post helpful. There's a good chance I've missed something, or failed to explain some aspect as clearly as I should have. Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

Happy Journeys!

So I've been extracting DMT from ACRB for a bit over a month and got quite good at it.  I made about 14g in total.  I was giving a bit out to my friends and a few people who wanted to try it out. I guess one of those people was a confidential informant for the local narcotics task force in my area.  I sold her a gram.  Later that night I heard a knock at the door and before I knew what was going on, I was pinned to the floor with my hands behind my back.  About 6 officers rushed into my house and turned it upside down taking all of my lab equipment, paraphernalia, and drugs.  I was arrested under four 2nd degree felonies and a class A misdemeanor.  I'm out now, but I got evicted from my house, lost most of my possessions, got put on a strict probation, and owe a lot of fines.  If I mess up at all again, I will be sent to prison for 1-15 years and will be charged $15,000.  

Be careful out there guys, DMT is one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced, but the US government thinks it's as dangerous as Meth. Be careful who you sell it to. Safe travels🚀😎",1

"An in depth explanation on how SSRIs and MAOIs work, why they affect serotonergic psychedelics, and why you should never mix the two (and other useful information)
**Serotonin and Neurons**

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is strongly tied to mood. In a normal human metabolism (i.e. unmedicated), serotonin is released into the [synaptic cleft from the vesicles in the axon of a neuron.](https://imgur.com/a/sW2O5) The serotonin then binds to the receptors on the dendrite of another neuron. This causes a neural impulse which, in simple words, is how signals are sent through the brain. After the neuron has fired, a process called reuptake occurs. Reuptake is the absorption of unbound neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft back into the axon of a neuron.

**SSRIs**

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a mainstream class of drugs used in the treatment of major depressive and anxiety disorders. They work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin. This effectively keeps the synaptic cleft between neurons flooded with serotonin, making the neurons more likely to fire. Serotonergic psychedelics, [tryptamines in particular](https://imgur.com/a/mBOa5), are actually structurally similar to serotonin and therefore work by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain. SSRIs almost completely diminish the effects of psychedelics for two reasons. SSRIs cause downregulation of serotonin receptors, which essentially means there is a decrease in the number of serotonin receptors as a result of chronic exposure to excessive amounts of serotonin. The other reason is that SSRIs keep the synaptic cleft flooded with serotonin, meaning the psychedelic has to compete with large amounts of serotonin in order to bind to a receptor. The result is an insufficient amount of the psychedelic binding to the receptors in the brain.

**MAOIs and RIMAs**

**M**ono**a**mine **o**xidase **i**nhibitors are an antiquated class of antidepressant drugs that work by inhibiting the enzymes monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). MAO-A is responsible for removing (metabolizing) serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and other amines (including tryptamines) from the brain. MAO-B degrades phenethylamines and dopamine. The effect of an MAOI is elevated levels of serotonin, norephinephrine, dopamine, and phenethylamine in the brain. MAOIs increase the effects of both tryptamines and phenethylamines because they inhibit the enzymes which break them down. The result is lengthened and more intense trips.

 **R**eversible **i**nhibitors of **m**ono**a**mine oxidase work by only inhibiting MAO-A. RIMAs are often called MAOIs in the psychedelic community. However, there is a clear and important difference between the two. RIMAs are more widely used as they are reversible in the inhibition of monoamine oxidase which makes them generally safer. However they will only potentiate tryptamines. **[IMPORTANT! MAOIs can be very dangerous if a very restricted diet is not followed.](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/expert-answers/maois/faq-20058035)**

**Why SSRIs and MAOIs/RIMAs should never be used at the same time**

Both SSRIs and MAOIs/RIMAs drastically increase the levels of serotonin in the brain through different mechanisms. The result of using both at the same time is almost guranteed to result in dangerously high levels of serotonin, leading to [Serotonin Syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) Serotonin syndrome is a potentially lethal condition and makes you feel extremely sick at best. If you are considering discontinuing an SSRI (which I strongly do not recommend) in order to use a psychedelic drug and/or an MAOI/RIMA, it is important to note the proper precautions. The effects of SSRIs do not disappear after 2 to 3 days. you should wait *at least* 2 weeks from your last dose before you consider using an MAOI/RIMA. However, it is ideal that you wait 4 - 8 weeks. You *can* use a psychedelic shortly after discontinuing and SSRI however the effects will not be maximized until the effects of the SSRI has completely worn off, which in some cases can last months after the last dose.

You also should not stop taking an SSRI outright. SSRIs have hellish withdrawals and therefore should be tapered in order to avoid becoming very sick. You should do your own research on how to discontinue the use of your particular SSRI, as the procedures vary. It is highly recommend that you consult with your doctor and/or pharmacist in order to discontinue an SSRI.

**It should also be noted that you should not take an MAOI with a substituted amphetamine such as MDMA. This combination is potentially lethal.**",0

"Took DMT For the First Time 3 Days Ago. Holy. Fuck.
This is a cross post from R/Psychadelics, I just made a Reddit account and just discovered the wonders of R/DMT :) 

Okay, let me start by saying that this was technically my second time taking DMT. A few weeks ago i iron-lunged .04 and saw some pretty kickass fractals and planes when i shut my eyes. However, on Saturday night i Iron-lunged .26g of it with my girlfriend. We loaded a bowl and had a buddy fill it and pass it as fast as possible for us. I took two massive milky hits and an intense ringing was zooming towards me at a high speed. My DMT instructor buddy filled it once more and i said ""ringing. ringing."" and he said ""hit this bro."" It was the last earthly sound I heard for the next 6-7 minutes.

The ringing got insanely loud, and then it got so loud that it couldn't get any louder so it turned into this high frequency fast paced dubby type sound. It immediately felt to me like it became a part of me, and was channeling messages and intelligence into my brain. I was hearing someone advise me, it was just in a different tongue. An alien tongue.

The sound was so intense it took me down. I laid back onto my bed and as soon as my back hit the bed i was backflipping through a world of constantly changing fractals and trippy ass patterns unfolding in front of me as i backflipped further and further from my body. After this i realized how overwhelming it really was and was blown away, taken aback for a second but i believe my previous psychadelic endeavours helped me to keep control in that setting. I was then sucked into a very long, big room. Couches and coffee tables covered in wallpaper-like patterns that were waving and moving filled the room, like a 100 yard hospital waiting room or something. I saw 9 entities sitting in different locations on these seats, just looking at me waiting to see who I would prefer to speak to first. I was so fucking blown away. I felt so small and alien, like i was in a fucking video game or something. 

For a second i opened my eyes and What. The. Fuck.. As i opened my eyes i saw what was around me but with completely different landscapes, and everyone in the room had millions of tracers waving around them and all 3 of my friends were bright and glowing. But everything that was previously on my left, was on my right, and vice versa. I didn't notice until I came out but it tripped me out preetttyyy good lol. I have been reading for years and it wasn't anything like what i have been conjuring up in my head the past few years in my reads. Completely other-worldly. But it felt like home as well. To me personally, it felt like the place i was before i came to earth. The entities were very happy to see me, i was very welcome there. It felt strangely homey and familiar.
All in all I am just so happy and glowing to have gotten back in touch with that kind of spirituality and whats feels like mankind's true roots. I feel as though i am not stuck inside of this skin and bones. I know that my soul will one day leave this body and I will still be me. It has given me an unexplainable kind of content feeling and feeling of inner peace.

If you are thinking about trying DMT I truly can't advocate enough. It is such an eye-opener. I have been taking shrooms and L for two and a half years at some pretty massive doses and was never able to truly hallucinate or see even fractals/visions. This fucking did it like no other. Milliseconds into hitting it the second time fractals and tracers and unfamiliar colors came alive like the sunlight to a dark day. Boom. 2 seconds and you're in psychadelic heaven getting in touch with all-knowing entities from completely different dimensions, giving you knowledge that no man or woman can provide.
I will probably wait a significant amount of time before i try it again. Perhaps dose a different tryptamine like shrooms again to see if it feels any different, post-DMT trip. It was just extremely intense and very sacred, and I want it to stay that way. However, i feel like i could microdose that godly magical molecule on a nightly basis, lol.
Well, i apologize for the length, just so fucking mind blown from this weekend. Unbelievable messages and intelligence was just getting tossed around like a ball between 9 different gods right in front of my face. Fucking Awesome. Take DMT.",1

"I can’t believe it...
Coming back from my second breakthrough and I am blown away.... A month ago I first acquired DMT and have been working my way up to breaking through. Yesterday, I finally broke through and met a male and female entity in the place where we exist before birth, and after death. I was in complete shock about what happened, it seemed so real, and it honestly felt like a very familiar place. I remember being thrown into what seemed like a raft in a river and could feel my body flowing with the river if that makes sense. Even though it seemed so real, I was still skeptical about what happened so I decided to try it again today. I met the same entities except they showed me so much more. I was given so many answers and I am so grateful! I don’t even know how to tell anyone about the experiences without sounding like an idiot. 

Edit: I’m not stating any of the above as the truth. I’m simply giving my perspective on things from the experiences I had. ",1

"Bumpy start to using DMT....but I finally met the machine elves!
TL:DR- Broke through....was amazing

So I extracted some magic from some biomass this weekend after much study and consideration. I felt that I needed to manifest this experience with my own hands to get the most out of it. It was certainly worth all the hours of reading and investigation. I watched everything I could watch on youtube and read everything I could digest on erowid and DMTnexus. It was the best investment of time in my entire life pursuing an experience. 

Yesterday I got all the equipment to properly maximize vapor efficiency. I thought I was gonna breakthrough on my first hit because I have extensive experience with psychs and was a cocky moron. I loaded up the pipe and took 3 puffs. I was transported to a different place with very interesting laws of geometry. I got to a point where a spinning fractal lotus appeared with the suggestion that it was a doorway from a disembodied voice that was like a guide once I got to the door. The guide then telepathically implied that I was not ready and that I needed to come back later. I then watched the door disintegrate and the experience slowly came back to baseline. No breakthrough. 

I waited 4 hours and read some more about the experience...decided that my smoking technique was shit. So I got a dab torch out so I could more steadily control the vapor. I loaded up the pipe again and took 3 hits. I had a similar experience to the first time. I was denied entry. I came back to baseline again and decided to fast and sleep on it. 

I woke up today and felt pretty fresh and optimistic. I meditated and tried to empty my head. So by mid-day my mental set was in the proper state. I cleaned up my house. I broke a 20 hour quick-fast with a nice vegetarian meal. I decided to give it one last try before shelving the idea. So I loaded up A LOT in the pipe and turned the dab torch down to super low. I preheated the pipe and once the vapor started to rise....I slowly inhaled a steady DEEP WHITE stream of vapor. 1 hit. I don't even remember a lotus door because by the time I exhaled....I had entered my alien flesh suit and began to watch my room become a fractal cathedral made of prismatic legos and duplo blocks. I became agitated because I thought I had to get the guides permission to get there, but the guide was gone and instead the world became a grid panel of insectoid 'machine elves'. It looked like Hollywood Squares, but infinite and not entirely light hearted and pleasant. Each prismatic lego elf had a personality and a mission. I had my attention drawn to the two elves in the center of my 'field of vision'. They had telepathic dialog with me and when I tried to use my voice...it became a visual glossolalia that they comprehended as what appeared to be a purely vibrational syntax. They were pleased/amused in the end that I tried to use my flesh suit to communicate with them. The panels fell away like tiles to reveal the consensus reality that I found familiar, but the roof of my room was still a cathedral and it was beautiful. I watched the roof shift as Herbie Hancock's ""Vein Melter"" played in the background. I was literally trembling with excitement when I came back. 

Its been about an hour now since this all happened and I'm still unpacking a lot of it and the implied symbolism for issues I need to examine in my life. I respect this compound SO MUCH. I can't believe how beautiful this experience was. I feel spiritually invigorated. I can't wait to see where this goes now. Thanks for reading...I had to document my thoughts somewhere.

"I had my first DMT breakthrough on 300ug LSD
One day my parents announced that they were going away for a whole night and wouldn't be back until late the next day. Knowing how rare this was, me and my brother jumped on the chance to trip on that day. This would be my brother's first psychedelic experience so I recommended that he do 100ug of acid. I decided that I would go for 300ug, a dose of LSD I haven't attempted since last summer.

I also ordered 100mg DMT, I hadn't decided if I was going to smoke the DMT whilst I was on acid, I had heard of Terence Mckenna almost always smoking DMT whilst peaking on acid. This would give him the most intense experiences. Since I hadn't had a full breakthrough experience I was wary. 

On the day my brother decided to invite 4 of his friends over, Jack (200ug), James (50ug first experience), Harry (Sober), Elliot (Sober). They dropped at 1:00PM and were going to slip out the house before my mum pops home to pick up a few things after work for her night out. 


I had made the decision to drop just as my mum leaves as I had to spend some time with her and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to do that on a high-ish dose of lucy! Those guys dropped and smoked a joint whilst I smoked a few bowls. The first timers and especially Jack were absolutely loving it and they wouldn't stop talking about how cool the patio looked. 


Anyways everybody but me left to hang out in a local woodland area and I stayed in the house, my mum got back in time and we sat down and watched some TV for a bit. At around 3:30 my mum had to set off so I said goodbye to her and dropped two 155ug tabs. 


Shortly the rest of the guys and my brother came back tripping balls and in good time as it started raining as soon as they got back. 


After chilling and smoking a few bowls with them I listened to some Stone Roses and over the trip I watched an entire season of South Park (A little over 3 hours total). Of course, into between all that I was spending a lot of time with my eyes closed, enjoying the stunning CEV. 


My snacks for the trip were primarily candy and watermelon (A MUST TRY, JUST DO IT, YOU WON’T REGRET IT!). I eat very basic and easy foods as stuff involving meat products really grosses me out whilst tripping for some reason, so a lot of the food in the house was ruled out. 


It was getting rather late and I had just remembered that I had some DMT, the trip was giving me increased confidence and I was getting a real message that it was my time. I doubled checked the safety of the combo and found that it was all good. With that I sandwiched some of the spirit molecule between two layers of weed in my bong.


I sat down by my bed, took a toke and inhaled. I felt my body start to vibrate and the patterns from the acid were mixing and overlapping with the patterns from the DMT. I lit the rest of the bowl, inhaled and held in for 10 seconds, exhaled and WHAM.
I felt like I had been punched in the face, my head swung back and then it happened. I distinctively remember being zapped into a mysterious realm. It happened so fast. The ground was covered in giant golden castles that seemed to go on forever.  I entered one and the inside structure was made up of rotating blocks of every colour imaginable. I was in absolute awe; the complex nature of this place was astounding.  


The experience was truly mind-blowing, I didn’t have a body or an ego. I was simply a vessel.  Eventually I opened my eyes and I had returned to my room, it took a while to get my bearings but when I found them I was filled with joy and energy. I ran around the house smiling, everything looked a bit different, much more neat than normal. The visuals were still awesome, on top of everything looking awesome and in place, and very curvy

 
Anyways I ran into the front room where Jack and my brother were chilling, I tried to tell them about my experience but I couldn’t stop stuttering! Eventually I got my words out and it felt really good to share my experience with someone.


Since I had glowsticks the three of us decided to have a glowstick war! We turned the lights out and threw glowsticks at each other. The tracers were unbelievable. It was getting late (2AM) so they all started to get ready for bed, I spend the rest of my trip watching some South Park whilst in bed. I had a great time during this trip and gained a lot of confidence in myself and really increased my self-worth.  The DMT experience was truly something else, it was probably the most intense experience of my entire life (10g Shrooms is pretty heavy too though). But strangely I couldn’t take much of a direct message or a lesson from the DMT. I learned a lot about how I tick from the LSD but struggled to take much from the breakthrough. I believe this is probably because I need to have a bit more experience with the molecule to start taking something back with me.


I’m not sure if I will try acid again anytime soon, I really want to get a few 2CB experiences under my belt. Also, there are a few psyches I still would be interested in trying and those would be 2CE and Mescaline.


Thanks for reading my trip report, peace and love :) ☮",1

"My first ever huge dose of DMT (Changa), instantaneous breakthrough, 'Broken Reality', lasted for 40 minutes!
**The Experience:**

I recently partook in a Changa ceremony with a few friends, I was first to try this batch of the Changa which I sourced through a friend. The process of creating the Changa was complicated and the exact amount of ingredient was by no means accurate. There were apparently ‘5 doses’ in total in this batch each containing an estimated ~35mg/50mg of DMT. I had previously only experienced low Changa doses, “sub-breakthrough”, very relaxing, physical and short lived (6-10min) experiences with very little profound insight. So after some meditation, sharing and intention setting, I put on some music and was took my place in our nest of covers and pillows to have my experience. The set and setting were ideal, the room was dimly lit by a lamp and candles, white sage incense was burning and the nest we had created was so comfortable and warm. 

I grabbed the bong, took a few long deep breaths and hit the mixture with the lighter, letting it ignite and allowing it burn naturally. I took the entire hit in one and the moment I opened my mouth to exhale, there was a dramatic, immediate shift in the way I was perceiving reality. As I exhaled the lungful of smoke, the tone of my breath shifted in tones down the scale from it’s normal tone down to a very deep tone an then persisted very loudly and became very similar to the om chant. There was this sudden upward shift in energy, a bolt of energy up my spine reduced me of my physical form and shifted my perception into what could only be translated as; a 360 degree spherical point of awareness. I did not ‘leave’ the location I was at, I didn’t travel or fly, reality just simply shifted. Simultaneously, each single point in the material world around me lit up as infinitely large/small spheres in a combination of all the colours and each point in space shot beams of light and energy outward in every single direction to infinity. This left me with the inability to ‘see’, my surroundings dissolved into what I can only describe as a linear, 5th dimensional grid like structure, every single point in my immediate space contained infinite potential energy was all intricately interconnected with each other through these beams of light and energy. I was able to traverse this reality with my awareness, delving into each point of space resulted in me returning to where I started. At this point I lost connection to the ‘real world’, my friend said that I gracefully laid back into the nest. I experienced complete and utter transcendence of my ego. I lost all reference points. I wasn’t ‘seeing’ anything, there was just pure awareness, it was an awareness of my entire existence, all that ever was, will be and is, everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing all existed in this formless, timeless pool of awareness. I had nothing to ‘contemplate’, or ‘experience’. I simply was for eternity. As part of my cognitive ability and ego returned, I had a feeling that I had officially left the reality that I knew, I had achieved what I was looking to achieve, part of the higher reality, the source. I was/A presence was communicating that ‘this is not really what you want to achieve, the higher reality is chaotic and conscious awareness cannot exist here, your reality is the haven, Nirvarna, samadhi.’ I wanted to be back to a place where I can be still, where I can witness order born from the chaos but it didn’t seem apparent that I could ever go back, I could not fully surrender to the possibility that I had left my reality, there was some kind of tension, It was as though the reality could not be stable with my awareness there.

I had no reference of time but out of the experience I had my physical form again, I opened my eyes but could still not see the reality that I knew so well, the grid like energy field persisted, confusion took a hold, I thought that I should be returning to baseline by now, I sat still, moving my head around, trying to see. What remained of my ego at this point had a sudden sense that ‘reality at its fundamental level was revealing itself’ and the first thought I was able to process was ‘I have broken reality’. I tried so hard to ‘see’ the room I was in before, but as I looked around there was still no form, just a field of energy, I buried my head into the nest and tried once more to surrender to the experience, I remember reaching my arms out and grabbing my friends so tightly, I felt like the roots of a tree, reaching out for some connection to the earth. Slowly I began to remember, I was aware of me moving my body, I sat up and tried to speak but I had no concept of language, the more I tried to ‘see’, the reality of the room that I knew before the experience, began to take form out of the energy. The structure of the room began to take form and then the lighting came back, the objects and my friends in the room began to take form out of this infinite field of energy. The energy rearranged itself to form the reality, I remember uttering the words ‘guys’, and it feeling so alien, no reference, I then said to my friends; ‘I need some reference points’, they told me the time, date and my location, it was all still alien. I said, ‘What is going on!?, I think I’ve broken reality’. I stood up and tried so dearly to ‘see’ my normal reality’. I was terrified. I walked toward the door in the room, not to leave, but to see if I could open the door. I needed some earthly grounding. I opened the door, leant on the door, took a deep exhale and walked back to the nest. I sat down, I said my own name, my location and that I had just taken a bong hit of DMT. A rush of euphoria, I laughed, and for the next few moments I truly embraced the state of being. I realised I was the true creator of my reality, I sat cross legged on the floor with a straight spine and held my hands out infront of me. I was stunned by what I was seeing, my arms and hands were created entirely of this 'light energy' and there was no immediate separation between me and the space around me, I was just a denser collection of the light energy in comparison to the space around me. I took some deep breaths and felt life rushing into my body. I felt so incredibly powerful, the power that comes with the realisation that you are the sole creator of your life journey. I buried my head into the nest for a moment, and surrendered to my emotions, I felt something new, a combination of all the emotions. I sat up, the experience still fully immersive and said, ""how long ago did I take the bong hit?"" My friend replied, ""30 Minutes at the very least"". I became really confused, ‘How is this lasting so long’, I thought, ‘Is this Changa different?’, ‘Have I blasted off into some ayahuasca experience that is going to last 6 hours?’.

My experience of reality was still shifted and it appeared to me that my friends were sat stunned, gazing at me. Surely they are going to begin growing concerned about my wellbeing, I thought. They looked like statues made of light, I said the words ‘wow’, and ‘holy shit’, repeatedly as the realisation of what I had just experienced settled in, broken up with intermittent laughter. Another 5-10 minutes passed and the visual experience began to settle, I could finally see the room begin as it was with worldly textures and my friends as they were once more. I had a huge weight lifted off my shoulders, I was so grateful to be alive, back in the waking reality, I felt like I had to be back here to complete my life journey. I was at the same time so incredibly humbled, stunned, satisfied and so grateful for the profound and unfathomable glimpse into what I believe to be the fundamental reality/divine source/‘god’/Infinity/My 'self'. I was on the brink of tears, but they manifested as laughter, laughter because that is all we can do when we realise the profundity of the entire universe.

**Length of experience:**

So the experience itself lasted from 40-50 minutes, I have no idea why this is. I can only guess that I had a clump of the changa that was highly concentrated with a lot of DMT and MAOI/Harmalas. I would love to know if anyone else has had similar, longer lasting experiences. My friends had 1/3rd of the dose I had afterwards, I was not willing to let them have the same amount as me, and their experiences lasted only 6-10 minutes.

**My insight from the experience:**

Life–here, now, on planet earth is the most precious form of reality we could ever hope to exist in and perhaps the only place that conscious awareness has managed to be manifest. There is so much more going on in this universe than we could ever hope to imagine and/or understand. Our ability on this earth to simply *be*, is the only reason we need to exist. We already have everything that we could ever need and that our ability to simply experience ourselves is the most fundamental purpose of life. The universe, out of all its infinite chaos has dedicated a pocket in all of its eternal potential to create a simple, ordered and beautiful reality whereby it can experience a portion of itself temporarily–in the form of the *human experience*. I genuinely now do not have any fear of death, I cannot explain why this is and I did not go into the experience looking for this realisation, but it is a fortunate outcome. I seemed to understand the entire universe for the merest of moments and genuinely feel privileged and lucky to be alive in a time where I have the majority of Maslow's needs fulfilled and am excited to continue my journey of self-actualisation. The most beautiful memories were experiencing order being born out of chaos as I returned to baseline. I realised that the pure non-dualistic reality is highly unstable and that it requires a dualistic reality within itself to be stable, find balance and for a conscious feedback loop (self/other) to be possible.

As my ego and sense of self dissolved, It was as though the tiny aperture (me/dualistic reality) that the universe sees itself through, expanded. It could no longer see itself through the dualistic tiny eyes of me, but the wider eyes of the non-dual whole. The more my ego dissolved, the more the universe could see of itself. Like a feedback loop, eventually the loop became too fast and intense until it collapsed on itself where I found my awareness bathing in infinity for eternity. 

I often get the sense that when people have DMT experiences, they are laid back, with their eyes closed and having their experience within themselves. My experience was different in that it was a complete combination of the internal and external universes, I was sat up and even stood up at times with my eyes wide open, interacting with this 'new' reality. Also, whenever I hear about DMT experiences I feel that people struggle to 'bring anything back' or remember anything because it's so fast but that is where my experience is different, I had eternity to contemplate and experience everything and it's all so vivid and clear within me still even now.

**Post-Experience Integration:**

When I am not occupied by work or other people, I find myself in a complete and utter state of bliss. So very calm and content, with no sudden desires, simply flowing through whatever may come. I close my eyes and I can see so clearly what I saw during my experience and feel exactly what I did. I am being brought to tears fairly often, not tears of sadness, tears of awe and gratitude. Such a huge amount of appreciation for being a simple, mundane human being on planet earth with a simple and still life where we can simply experience ourselves. Plenty of laughter too. 

A good image to represent the way I experienced reality is this piece of art by Alex Grey: https://www.z2systems.com/neon/resource/cosm/images/Alex_Grey-Spiritual_Energy1.jpg

EDIT: I'd like to make it very clear that I would not recommend every person that read this post find the courage to take a huge hit of DMT. Every single person has a completely unique life journey and therefore this experience can never be reexperienced. I am a lucky person in that I had a great upbringing, have a healthy and privileged lifestyle and consider myself to be generally mentally, emotionally and physically healthy. I feel like there would be many people that would really struggle to integrate the experience that I was so lucky to experience. (There is also no real need to take DMT, In already did, found all the answers that you are looking for and shared them with you 😉)",1

"Luna's Sous Vide ATB Tek (with pictures!)
Hey, r/DMT! 

I'm normally mostly a lurker here, but based on the response to my last post, it seemed as if a lot of people were interested in my DMT extraction technique that uses a water bath, among other improvements to previous teks. I am able to yield 2.5\-3&#37; by weight of DMT (before further purification) from MHRB using this process, and in my opinion it is easier to perform, with less room for error, than most existing teks while still having very high yields. I hope that sharing my experiences and ideas regarding this extraction will help more people experience this wonderful medicine. I'd also like to thank the people who inspired this tek with their research/teks in the past \- including Q2121, Cybs, and Noman among others.

If you're interested in learning a bit of the chemistry/logic behind this tek, which I recommend, I've included all of that information below. If you skip straight to the recipe, that's fine as well, but please read through this section first if you have any problems.

# Chemistry/Materials Background

Many plants, including the tree our bark in this tek is extracted from, contain DMT. However, because DMT is only a small part of these plants (usually only 3\-4&#37; max), it is very difficult to make use of it without extracting the raw DMT. When a DMT\-containing plant comes in contact with an acid, such as vinegar, the DMT will want to migrate to a source of water. Luckily for us, vinegar contains water. Now that the DMT is in our acidic water, adding a strong base, such as lye, will begin to convert the acidic form of DMT into a neutral, also known as ""freebase"", form. Now we still have the problem of extracting this neutral DMT from our water. Cue naphtha **\*drum roll\***. As a non\-polar solvent, naphtha is much more inviting to DMT than our water, so the vast majority of DMT will go to the naphtha when we mix it with our solution. After we have our DMT\-laden naphtha, freezing it will help solidify DMT crystals and separate them from the naphtha. Freezing lowers the amount of DMT that can be absorbed in a quantity of the solvent, meaning the crystals will separate. After the DMT is out of the naphtha, it's ready in freebase form to be used however you desire\~

I'll explain the ""**sous vide**"" part now \- in the cooking world, it's common for chefs to use a method of cooking called sous vide, where food is put into a water bath at a constant temperature for a long period of time, which makes all of the food cook evenly, as opposed to other methods like ovens, which heat the outside of food much more quickly than the inside. While experimenting with some earlier teks, I realized that controlling the temperature of the solution would greatly simplify the process.

With regards to sourcing materials: I recommend shredded MHRB over powdered, because powdered bark seems to be VERY vulnerable to emulsions (meaning your solution will not separate at the final step) in my experience, and doesn't seem to increase yield. Water, vinegar and salt aren't a big deal, you can find them all at your local grocery store. Sodium Hydroxide may be a little trickier to find \- it's sold as lye for soap/candle making (check craft stores), crystal drain cleaner (hardware stores), and as simply Sodium Hydroxide by chemical supply stores. Other redditors seem to have luck finding Roebic Laboratories Drain Cleaner Crystals at Lowes, Home Depot, etc. Any source will be fine, as long as you make sure it is 100&#37; Sodium Hydroxide. Naphtha is found in most lighter fluids. North Americans should be able to find Ronsonol Lighter Fluid at most stores; I can't offer advice on brands for anywhere else in the world.

There are some notable differences between this tek and some of the older, more popular ones (Cybs' ATB, Noman's, etc.) The most important is that I use a constant water bath instead of heating the mixture on a stove. There are multiple advantages to my method: When dealing with these sensitive plants, it's important not to overheat them. DMT can be damaged even by temperatures around 55\-60C. A stove, which a lot of teks recommend will burn at well above the temperatures needed to extract from MHRB, and so you'll have to constantly monitor the temperature and turn the stove on and off. Using a sealed container in a water bath helps keep a more constant temperature, increases safety by not having to leave a heating element on, and improves yield. Another big one is that I use different quantities of some solutes \- Cybs' tek, for example recommends mixing 50g of lye with 200ml of water. This actually creates a fairly weak basic solution that is further diluted by all of the other ingredients. With both the salt and lye steps, I use quantities at the solubility point in water (\~35g/100ml for salt, and \~110g/100ml for lye) to create a fully dissolved solution. Particularly with the lye, using too much of the base does not really pose much of a risk. The more basic the end solution is, the more  material will be released from the bark. With the vinegar acting against the lye, I find that more lye almost always increases yields by ensuring the pH level of the solution is as high as possible.

Now, on to the actual procedure!

# Materials needed

50g Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark, shredded if possible

600ml of Distilled Water

60ml White Vinegar (5&#37;)

35g Sea/Kosher Salt (table salt is not ideal, but works in a pinch)

330g Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH, aka Lye)

50ml Naphtha

Some method of heating a water bath (sous vide cooker, crockpot on low, etc.)

1L Mason Jar or similar sealed container

Kitchen Scale (must be accurate to at least 1g)

Funnels for pouring liquids into the jar

Spoon for mixing solutions

Airtight container(s) for pulls

https://i.redd.it/ibxoivln48311.jpg

Notes on material selection in the previous section. If you choose plastic for any of your containers or utensils, make sure that it as a type of plastic that is safe to use with solvents and strong acids and bases. HDPE is fairly standard in new plastic products, and is safe for this tek.

# Section 1: Prep

1A. Preheat a water bath (I use an Anova Culinary Sous Vide Precision Cooker) to 125F. This is the **ONLY TIME** in this tek that tap water is acceptable. In all other cases of the word ""water"", please make sure you use distilled, deionized water. Tap water, or water that contains certain minerals, can affect some of the compounds we need for this tek.

https://i.redd.it/mnbvxhov48311.jpg

1B. Place 50g MHRB (I use shredded, explained in appendix) into a 1L Mason Jar.

https://i.redd.it/bnhao6ox48311.jpg

1C. Make sure you have safety equipment, including goggles, gloves, and vinegar ready to neutralize a lye spill, as well as your measuring equipment and containers on hand.

# Section 2: Acid (the other kind)

1A. Mix 200ml water and 60ml vinegar and add it to the jar and mix thoroughly. Add the jar into the warm water bath, which should be stable at around 125F for the rest of the procedure.

https://i.redd.it/j0cptsjz48311.jpg

1B. Depending on the atmospheric pressure where you are, the contents of the jar may not be enough to hold it upright in the water bath. If your jar won't stay stable on its own, weigh it down with a dense jar or can of food.

https://i.redd.it/pxsk1mxd58311.jpg

1C. Wait an hour for the acidification to take place.

1D. Remove the jar from the water bath to add the basification ingredients.

https://i.redd.it/kibyid2658311.jpg

# Section 3: Salt and Base

3A. Mix 100ml water and 35g salt. Heat the container to just boiling. The hotter the water is, the more salt will dissolve in it. However, make sure not to go past boiling, as you'll lose some of your water. When the salt is fully dissolved in the water, add to the jar.

https://i.redd.it/weoid53l58311.jpg

3B. Add 330g sodium hydroxide to 300ml of cold water in a separate container. Stir until dissolved.

https://i.redd.it/wnlbbkor58311.jpg

**TAKE NOTE**: Do not add all of the lye at once. Pure lye is a very strong base, with a roughly 14 pH level. It is corrosive to skin in its pure form, so be careful not to get any of it on your body. In the event that some gets on you, immediately apply vinegar to the area; Vinegar, as an acid, will neutralize the lye (this is also a key part of the solution we make in this tek). Add about 50\-100g at a time, slowly pouring from your storage container, stir, and wait for the mixture to settle. In the pictures, you will see that I added 148g of lye over a period of about 2\-3 minutes while stirring, then zeroed the scale to add the rest (182g in this case). You may notice that initially, some of the lye will clump up in the bottom of your container. This is normal, just break up any large clumps with a spoon and stir. Adding NaOH to water creates an exothermic reaction \- this means it generates heat. As the solution heats up, more and more of the lye will become soluble in the water (similar to how we heated up the saltwater to maximize solubility.)

https://i.redd.it/zyp7n09068311.jpg

3C. Add the sodium hydroxide solution to the jar, using a funnel if you have one.

https://i.redd.it/esviu3y668311.jpg

3D. You should now have a volume of about 800ml in your jar. If the volume is less than 800ml, add water to make up the difference.

3E. Shake the jar and leave it in the water bath for 2 hours, shaking periodically.

# Section 4: Solvent

4A. Add 50ml of naphtha to the jar. Shake to mix and add to the water bath. Note that you don't need to shake very hard at all. Shaking violently will just create excess pressure; Instead, turn the jar sideways and roll it repeatedly towards you while gently shaking it back and forth.

4B. Wait for the naphtha to separate, which could take up to 30 minutes (but probably won't), then shake again. When the naphtha is separated, you should be able to see a ""line"" at the top of the jar separating the naphtha from the black bark mixture. Repeat this process a total of 5 times. I find that it usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes each time for the naphtha to fully separate.

https://i.redd.it/0v2kujbb68311.jpg

4C. If you have any troubles with the naphtha not separating, in most cases adding salt to the jar will speed the process up. This is because the ionic property of salt makes it easier for the naphtha to separate from water.

4D. Suck the naphtha from the top of the jar using a pipette or turkey baster, and place in an airtight container (I prefer pyrex/normal glass, but HDPE plastic also works). If your container is small, and the naphtha gets more than a cm or two thick, feel free to use multiple containers, as thin layers of naphtha form usable crystals much more quickly. Place the naphtha container(s) into the freezer and wait 12 hours. Try not to disturb them during the crystallization process. Eventually, you'll start to see crystals forming, which look a bit like this:

https://i.redd.it/b2odd3ks68311.jpg

It's also possible that you'll get larger crystal formations such as these (which I find happens more on pulls with super\-saturated naphtha evaporating slowly):

https://i.redd.it/6dwt35a478311.jpg

4E. Repeat the entire set of naphtha steps (referred to as a pull) as many times as desired. I find with this method the vast majority of crystals are collected with only two pulls (one with fresh naphtha, and another with the stored naphtha after scraping the first batch of crystal), but you can do as many pulls as you want to.

# Section 5: Collection

5A. Remove the container from the freezer, immediately suck the naphtha out, and place the naphtha in a storage jar. You can reuse this for later pulls, and it's likely that the naphtha you just pulled out contains residue alkaloids that you can still make use of.

5B. Place your container somewhere dry. Use a fan or hair dryer (on cold setting, excess heat is a no\-no) to evaporate any naphtha residue.

5C. Your crystals should be ready to collect now. Use a razor blade or similar tool to scrape all of the crystals from each container.

5D. The crystals are somewhat unstable and can degrade with excess heat. Store them in a cool, dark area. I suggest placing your crystals in small zip bags, then placing those bags in a small, airtight container in the freezer.

After three pulls using this procedure, my final yield from 50g MHRB was \~1.7g of crystals as measured by a calibrated milligram scale, as can be seen below:

https://i.redd.it/zba68bkd78311.jpg

If past this point you wish to recrystallize, feel free to use one of the many methods available to do so (Cybs' tek has great instructions, for one). I personally don't recrystallize, as the crystals I'm left with are pure/white enough for my needs. If your DMT comes out significantly yellow or orange, you may want to wash or recrystallize. However, I am pretty much always left with the quality of crystals you see above when using this technique, and I feel no need to attempt further purification.

If you have any questions, suggestions or problems with the tek, feel free to PM me, or better yet, leave your comments in this thread. Hopefully this write\-up will help a few people make the most of their materials and improve the overall body of knowledge regarding this vein of A/B extractions. Best of luck to any who attempt an extraction using this tek!

"How DMT Can Change Everything
I'm eating healthier. Quit cigarettes. Had the most beautiful trip on Metacetin the other night with similar entity contact (80 - 90mg). I'm exercising; something I would never normally do. I'm eating more fruit. Finally not constipated as shit (pun intended). And slowly but surely I'll be off the 1.4mg/daily of suboxone shortly here. 

Etizolam was stopped after taking 40 - 50mg over the course of 12 days and I had one night of insomnia where I didn't sleep; and withdrawal symptoms similar to a weak opiate withdrawal. Suboxone wasn't helping either, but I didn't want to go over my daily dose. 

I'm thinking more rationally, my vocabulary has expanded exponentially. My thought process on life and death has changed completely. I feel as though I've unlocked a part of a big puzzle and it was scary as hell. It showed me who I am to the depths of my core and ripped my ego to shreds (dabbed the deemster, 20mg pure white crystal). It was something I had created and somehow it destroyed everything I had wanted from the experience and still it turned out to change me for the better. I didn't want a recreational experience, but I wanted something that would provoke change. 

I got what I bargained for, and maybe a little bit more. Once you go to the other side things change. Call it hyper space, call it an alternate dimension, call it whatever you want. Your inner voice projects itself as an entity (sometimes different with each breakthrough) and they tell you not what you want to hear, but what you need to hear. With aya it's a more prolonged experience and easier to bring back information to change yourself with. With N,N DMT its short quick and to the point, depending on how brave you are to continue, that's how much information you'll bring back.  

This is all my personal opinion, I don't suggest smoking DMT if you haven't done adequate research or if you don't have psychedelic experience (someone with a very sound mind). 

There's a quote by Terrence McKinna saying something along the lines of, ""the only risk with DMT is death by astonishment"" and this is completely true. Once you come back you might have a different outlook. 

I was incredibly depressed and hated myself. I learned in one week how to change that and started loving myself again already. Please be safe people. Love y'all <3",1

"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKIDY FUCK FUCK
Mind blown. Been a while since I blasted off. Did 1G of shrooms ""lemon tek"" tonight (makes trip about twice as potent but for half as long) which was going nicely in its own right... Tunes, drawing, contemplating the world. Ya know. But fuck me. Then I hit up 45mg of DM which I have been meaning to do whilst shroom tripping and it was hands down the best breakthrough I have ever had. 

I was ""partying"" with these sexy female entities. When I say ""partying"" I mean metaphorically exploding with happiness and bewilderment. At one point, almost as if I couldn't take it anymore, I started coming back into reality and into the room I was in, dribble running down my chin, not even able to wipe it because I was laughing so hard my stomach was cramped up. I was hysterical. But they literally reached out whilst smiling/laughing and nodding at me in acknowledgment of how crazy I was finding their world and dragged me back into hyperspace to ""party"" some more.

One night i had my dad over and were trying DMT. I had a few hits and went upstairs to the things i now call gods.

I never really came back with a WTF moment until my last hit of the night.

I packed the pipe proper good for that last time and went to another place, i kept my eyes open he whole time for this one...

I lit up, fist toke, second, thiiirrrrddd.

Boom! I was taken, eyes wide open. I remember this so distictly and so does my Dad i was going for the fourth toke when i lost my lighter in my hands. Both hands were empty, palms wide open looking at them. Then no shit i clicked my finger and it appeared i fucking lost my shit but then i clicked my other hand and it just shifted over without moving my hands together. 

I came back and just basically fell out of my recliner and layed on the floor saying what the fuck! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!!! For about two minutes.

I thought i just tripped hard. But the most fucked up part is my Dad said ""nah man it really fucking happened"". This moment still blows our minds today.

The same night my Dad did something i can only decribe as magic as well that we both witnessed. I'll write about it if you guys are interested but really these things happened. 

When i tell anyone this story i have him around and people don't want to believe it but we both were there and both seen it.

"Witnessing an IV trip
So a few days ago, my friend decided he was going to attempt an IV preparation of DMT. He’s a med student so he is pretty knowledgeable about how the whole stuff works, he explained it all to me but I was too busy being in shock by the fact that he told me he was going to shoot it lol. 
So long story short he came to shooting it but chickened our at the last minute and ended up begging me to do it for him (good trip sitter). After literally 1 or 2 seconds of emptying the syringe he immediately threw himself back onto the sofa with his eyes as wide as ever and pupils engulfing his whole eye started shouting ‘OHH WOWWW’ over and over. From here he slowly shut his eyes and was taken away for approximately 20-25 minutes which was scary to me as he was unresponsive and I wasn’t used to this long DMT trips but obviously IV lasts longer. 
After this he came back around extremely dazed and he asked me his name calmly followed by a quick panic asking who he was and where he was. This went on for a couple of minutes until his girlfriend came in the room and just hugged him and calmed him down with me.  This was pretty scary I thought he had broken his mind, as far as we have both gone with vaping DMT I have never seen this. 
I am trying to convince him to do a full trip report here so hopefully that happens but what he has explained to me is that he was in a garden with an entity who explained it was the ‘garden of emotion’ and that there were these bubbles filled with each emotion like anger, happiness, sadness, jealousy etc and he would swim through each one then pop the bubble. He explained this was a process of loosing his humanity to transcend further with this entity. He claims that after all the bubbles were popped he lost himself and nothing made sense anymore when he thought of the world as we know it such as words and emotions had no meaning. From here he ‘transcended’ further and the story goes on but I will leave that for him to hopefully complete. ",1

First of all let me say, if this has been done before mad props to the dude or chic who did it, but fuck all that ego shit, here's exactly how I did it. 
 I know I am am going to get a lot of negative feedback about spirituality and ceremonies, but personally I don't need any of that to understand the solid message mother Aya speaks. Anyhow, This is how I did it. I got 9 grams of syrian Rue (amazing plant by itself btw) and ground it to powder, then added 2 ounces of water, and 2 caps of white vinegar, you can use a whole lime/lemon, I simmered it down for 10 minutes, then added 2 ounces more water and did the same thing until there was about an once left. I used a piece of clothe to strain the rue liquid into a a smaller pot and carefully! simmered it down until it was basically a paste. I quickly poured it into a pyrex dish and allowed it to dry and harden. I used a razor blade the next day to scrap it up, its almost crystal in nature. Okay, I ordered red capsules (lols) online and I bought some beeswax (totally safe and digestible, its actually good for you) I rolled a very small amount of beeswax out with my hands and put about 30mg of pure DMT into it and carefully wrapped it up burrito style. Stuck it into the pill with about one third of the crystallized rue extract. I think its somewhere between 2.5 and 3mg of pure raw rue seeds. anyway IT FUCKING WORKED!!!!! I DID IT!!! My stomach took around 20 minutes I think! to break down the beeswax, and I had a full on Aya trip. One love!",1

"First trip on DMT, my single most mind blowing experience.
Last year I wasn't in the best place.  My first girlfriend of two years ended up cheating on me and I didn't take it well.  Whenever I was by myself I was unhappy.  I could not stop obsessing and after many hours of therapy I began to search for an alternate method for dealing with this sudden constant depression.  

I began to look to hallucinogens for any answers they might offer.  I began with acid and shrooms, which did begin to aid me in answering my questions.  Nothing, however, compared to DMT.

I would like to preface this with saying that I've never been religious, and before DMT I would't have even considered myself a spiritual person.

 I smoked it out of my bong with a vaporizer attachment and a jet lighter.  I inhaled deeply and exhaled a huge cloud of plastic/chlorine tasting smoke and instantly felt stranger than I've ever felt in my entire life.  There was still a good amount left over and even though every fiber of my body was telling me to stop my friend insisted so I finished what was left.

Right after I exhaled the second cloud it was as if I went from sitting in my bed getting launched into a completely different universe at 1000 miles per hour. While this was happening I was looking at my friend and I saw an infinite amount of multicolored points on his face which suddenly created rainbow trails as I was launched into this new, strange universe.  

When I arrived I was suddenly alone.  My perception of my friend was now completely gone, but I wasn't scared.  It felt as if I'd been to this universe countless times before and I had an overwhelming feeling that I belonged here - that all living things belonged here.

As I looked around the room I saw geometrical patterns in everything, even in the empty space around me.  The air was thick and contained a strangely beautiful white fog unevenly spread through the room.  Infinite detail in everything that is so normally mundane.  I saw the same patterns in everything and I had an overwhelmingly powerful feeling of connectivity with everything around me.  

I looked down at my body, which seemed so strange to me.  I had no feeling anywhere, and even though I have no desire to talk I doubt I could even if I wanted to.  It felt as if my body was no longer my property, but instead a part of the glorious whole of everything.  I looked back down to my body and I noticed spiderweb like strings coming out of every part of me.  I followed one of them up into the air and noticed that the webs were flowing into the fog all around the room.  Upon further inspection of this fog I noticed that it is not a fog at all but rather a collection of thousands and thousands of the same strings that were coming out of my body.  I noticed a huge clump of the webs conjoining and flowing to the other side of the room.  I followed them with my eyes and suddenly saw my friend for the first time.  I realized that they were all flowing into him the same way they flowed into me.  My astonishment having peaked I continued to look around the room and noticed that these webs are flowing into absolutely everything, although they do seem focused on my friend and I.  

Feeling the strangest combination of peace and amazement I closed my eyes for the first time.  I had thought the real world was beautiful, but it was nothing compared to this.  For anyone who has seen enter the void the visuals are pretty accurate, except with much more detail.  Alex Grey also does a great job of capturing DMT visuals.  After flying through this astounding universe I came upon a figure.  It was defiantly a woman, she was absolutely beautiful with rainbow fractals all over her body.  She said nothing but stared at me almost as if she was waiting for me to say something.  Nothing came to my mind.  She seemed so powerful and so peaceful.  I knew I could ask anything, but everything that was important to my human self suddenly ceased to matter.  I didn’t want to trouble such a beautiful deity with what seemed to me now to be so trivial.  So we just looked at each other until I opened my eyes again.

And just like that I was in the real world again, my understanding of the world completely changed.  I had felt as if I saw the inner workings of the universe, and I could have never imagined how beautiful it all is.  The problems with my ex-girlfriend stopped bothering me completely.  I became much happier than I ever had before.  I soon found myself with a new girlfriend shortly after, and I realized that it was my own foolish unhappiness that was keeping me down.  

If I had to sum up what I learned from this entire experience in once sentence - The universe is beautiful, and it will always work with you if you allow it to.

"I'm positive this was the one
I broke through with no doubt about it and I finally made contact with spirit elves. 

I've had a month or 2 break from smoking and I felt the itch again last night. Loaded my donut coils with a small-ish but potent amount.


1st hit was light: patterns start forming on the wall. Ringing in the ears



2nd hit was heavy: the room is transforming and becoming dark. Super noisy, almost like there are people yelling.



3rd hit was massive: as I start inhaling the room goes ballistic. It's dark and evil. The spirit elves show themselves and are going nuts. It's rowdy as hell in my room now, and them cheering me on makes it feel like everything is going to implode.


I finish my hit, hold it, put the vape down, lay back, exhale, and the elves were FUCKING ECSTATIC! It was like the liberation of France! There were fireworks! Cheering!

"Is it worth doing dmt?
I am currently in a place in life where I have had about enough of it. I don’t really know what’s going on and it seems like every aspect is falling apart. I’ve wanted to do dmt for a few years now and I’m educated on how to do it/how much I need and I’m thinking I want to give it a go. I was once told there is a small chance you can speak to dead relatives or friends while “sucked out” is this true? Is dmt ok to do if I’m unsure about my whole life? Could it give me the new perspective I need? Is there a chance it will give me an even worse perspective? Is there anything someone who has never done it before needs to know? 
Thanks everyone I’m just trying to weigh out my options.

Edit: thank you so much to everyone who gave me wisdom and support you were all incredibly helpful and I am grateful ",2
"a DMT entity I painted
",
"Intravenous DMT was unlike anything I have ever experienced
The very first time I had the chance to do dmt I did not break through. I smoked it on weed, but didn't sandwich it, so it just looked like pretty ""shroom visuals"". I had no oil burner, or dmt dome, but I had been an intravenous drug user in the past. I recently watched ""The Spirit Molecule"" where test subjects were given an IV drip of DMT. So, when my fiance at the time suggested we inject it I thought: ""Why not? It's a once in a lifetime experience.""

I was very nervous and excited, but I couldn't do it without my SO's help so he told me I would have to wait for him to do it first (which I DID NOT want to do, because I knew I would be frantic while waiting and create a bad energy). I'm not proud of this, but as soon as SO came out of it I was begging him to help me. For all of my whining though, he wasn't phased. He was just telling me to wait, be patient, and I would understand soon too.

Finally he pushed down on the syringe and I heard a high-pitched hum that kept getting louder and louder, until it was all I could hear. My vision was ripped from me and it felt like I was being torn from my body. Everything was black and white patterns and I had no idea where I was or how I got there, but I wanted to leave. Suddenly, I pulled open a drawer in my mind to see a classic smiley face wink and stick it's tongue out at me, as if it was playing a joke. Everything then burst out suddenly and seemed to say ""You found it! You found it! YOU FOUND THE KEY!"" At that moment, I remembered what I had done and that I had injected dmt. 

Instantly, everything disappeared and I was floating in darkness. Everything sloowwwed way down. There weren't really anymore visuals, but I wasn't in my body. I was just floating in nothing, with maybe a few floating specters of light. Something was talking to me. Soothing my soul. It was telling me to just stop and listen. So I did. And what came next was the most beautiful and perfect song I had ever heard. It was the song of the universe. I was in awe. Everything was perfectly in time. From the scratching of my dog, to the drip of the sink, to the crickets outside, to my rhythmic heartbeat. Throughout this time the voice guided me, as if to say, ""Can you hear it?"" I ~~sat~~ lied there in astonishment at how beautiful it was and how clearly the message was imparted until it faded away and I suddenly came out of it. The after parts were still in effect and everything looked psychedelic. I was left with a feeling of peace that I'm not sure I will ever be able to replicate. 

This occurred in 2013/14 and still remember everything perfectly. The song has unfortunately faded, but sometimes I feel like I can still hear it. To this day I can say with 100% confidence that that was the best psychedelic experience I've ever had. It was the best experience I've had on any drug, period. I do NOT recommend doing what I did, nor am I advocating it, but there is always more to discover and more limits to push. Just wait, be patient, and soon you will understand too. 

LATE EDIT: It's worth mentioning that the SO had a very similar experience, i.e. mostly auditory, song of the universe, floating in nothing, etc. ",1

**Dose****:** 50mg

**Method:** Glass oil pipe/meth pipe.

Just came back from my first breakthrough experience and thought I'd come and make my first reddit post about it since I've spent the last month and a half absorbing anything I could read on DMT.

So I first got my hands on some DMT four weeks ago with my mate and have smoked it three times, tonight being my third. The first two times I used the same method and dose and had good experiences, seeing incredible, morphing fractal patterns (going to the chrysanthemum/waiting room) but not breaking through. Tonight I thought I would give it a third attempt by using a torch lighter instead of a bic, and oh boy did it work. 

My friend held the pipe (this is a must imo) and heated the DMT until it vaporised, I took a huge first hit and held it, by the second hit I was already taking off. No ringing noise, just total chaos. I could feel myself being pulled out of the room and my entire vision was just collapsing in colours and movement, so I laid down and was instantly blasted out of my body into hyperspace. There were 10-12 of the 'elves' just moving around their realm showing me the most other worldly (aka DMT 'stuff') things over and over again. Their world is so perfect and detailed it completely dwarfed my previous DMT experiences. 

As those who have smoked DMT will know there is little that can be said about what you see and the shear speed it all happens. I lost any connection with my physical self. They communicated to me by altering how I felt and I could 'speak' back to them by doing the same. When I became anxious they calmed me down and reminded me to pay attention and I instantly felt a comforting connection. They projected a feeling of love into me, utterly pure love for all beings. As I was leaving they smiled and were all communicating a sense of clarity to say 'yes, now you understand it, you are welcome here'. 

Total trip lasted 8 minutes. Time is totally meaningless in hyperspace. Everything I read about breakthroughs is true. Unbelievable and just beautiful. When I finally came back to this world I could not speak and went between laughing and on the brink of tears for several minutes.

There is nothing to fear, it is pure love. However DMT **must** be respected, only continue down this path if you are totally ready to lose who you are and give in to the experience. Unsure about when I will next smoke DMT but I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to do it.

**TL;DR:** First time breakthrough into hyperspace, met the elves, felt pure love, fucking speechless.

Happy to give any limited advice I can offer.

Peace and love x",1

"I accidently did DMT for the first time...best mistake ever
I started the week by finishing up my stash of weed to start a new class and make sure I am being as productive as I can. I was smoking everything in sight even the little weed crumbs at the bottom of the baggies we had...Once I thought I was out of weed, I noticed the MFLB was filled with weed. I pack a small bowl with it and torch it...(MFLB was used for dmt and was unaware that it had DMT)

Then I open my eyes and notice my room is made up of only squares and triangles. So I close my eyes again, but this time I can't open them. I am shot forward into a world of massive yellow and red pyramids surrounding me. The colors were so intense it was incredible. Every nerve in my body was freaking out in the best way possible. 

The trip did not end up lasting too long. At least that is how I remember it since it was so overwhelming. It was almost better for me to do it accidently because I came up with a very calm mindset. Before I could have been scared, I was already in a different world. I came to peace with the fact I am tripping and had a great experience, but I still can't comprehend what just happened.

I am very unsure about trying it again, but who knows...it was almost like I was ready to trip

Sorry about the shitty grammar...I just had no idea how to put all my thoughts on paper after what happened",2

"DMT FIRST BREAK THROUGH!
I bought some pure DMT powder about three months ago. I wanted to try it so badly for so long... I've heard the stories of the ultimate trip and amazement to spiritual awakenings. But every-time i got a chance to smoke it I would pussy out because i was to anxious in fear of a bad experience.

I finally said ""fuck it"" and i lit the crack pipe and vaped that DMT, as soon as i felt the numbing and mothball tasting smoke i new i was in for it. I inhaled a big hit. I held it in and damn i was amazed by the effects, it was amazing but i was too afraid to hit it again.

The next day, I was on my way to school and I lit it up again and this time i inhaled three times in a row... i began tripping very hard and i found it near to impossible to move or even keep my eyes open. Breathing was difficult... but when i came back to reality i thought that everyone over exaggerated the experience... cause what i felt and saw was nothing like said...

After school, I grabbed my pipe and sat down. I said ""okay, this time I'm going to do it 4 times in a row"". After three i couldn't move but i managed to smoke another hit. It was at this point when everything was changing, sound was bending and reversing and the world was inching away from my head and turning into a whole new planet. I told myself... ""this is all i have left, I have to smoke one more hit"" 

I managed to raise the pipe to my mouth after lighting the pipe and allowing the vapor to fill the pipe. I inhaled one GIANT hit. about four seconds after inhaling it... I got extreme tunnel vision, my heart was pounding and my vision was taken by vivid patterns and colors. seconds after my eyes were closed and i could not open them. I kept hearing a ""voice"" saying ""it's okay... it's okay (echo)"" this repeated non stop... The voice turned into a vision of the most beautiful girl i have ever seen the voice turned to a harmless female voice... She said ""follow me, we don't have much time"" I followed her as unimaginable colors traced by my eyes.

She brought me to this place, it was like a forest, but the colors were a different contrast and the air was almost a purple color. The water looked fresh and clear, and this girl walked over to me and said ""it's been a while, How have you been Cole?"" it was odd because i remembered her but i don't remember remembering her. She showed me around and sat me down at a boulder and her and I just talked. She then said ""remember when we used to sit here?"" It was weird because i legitimately did remember. We stared at the sky, and the sky looked like a cluster of stars and galaxies, the air was the perfect temperature. This girl then stood me up, I began asking questions like ""why am I here"" and she said ""you're not here, your mind is here... you've been here before though and you will be here again"" I then said ""but this doesn't make any sense"" and she replied with ""of course it doesn't *giggles*... This entire time you've been here, you just can't live here when your spirit is on earth."" For some reason i understood this.... The girl disappeared and i was launched into space and time, in a colorful wheel of colors. I was brought to a place that looked very similar to earth but everything was backwards, like my house was facing east instead of west, and my bed was on the left side of my room instead of the right... I then saw myself enter the room... the girl appeared and said ""now do you get it?"" i smiled and said ""yeah...? kind of..."" she then said ""you see, You are here, there and everywhere... including with me for eternity. when i speak to this Cole *points at the Cole i'm looking at*, he will one day look down on you.""  She then warped me to this place in space, she pointed and she said ""see each light? well those are galaxies, each galaxy contains a replication of you but in another form and existence.... you are in every single dot.... just doing different stuff...."" i answered back with ""i get it... it's like my life has a bunch of combinations and each place holds one combination."" she giggled and nodded... she then brought me back to the forest, The Cole that lived with this girl walked over to me and said ""you're are doing good... thanks for coming i haven't seen you in a while.... it's about time for you to go back."" it was at this point when both the girl and myself waved goodbye as i slowly got pulled back to Earth.

I heard a pop, and i opened my eyes it was like waking up on a hospital bed in a movie... everything was blurry, when my vision came real i was still sort of hallucinating. I sat up thinking about this girl, i instantly began missing her... I began to literally cry..."" when i was done tripping in all (as in no hallucinations) i sat back and thought deep... I was amazed with my discovery. As i closed my eyes to go to sleep, i heard that girls voice in my head ""*giggles*, I'm still here! always and forever"" and this made me open my eyes to the feeling of warmth and comfort.

Anyways this trip was by far the coolest and most intense... it's like i can't describe it... the amazement and feelings i felt were un-feelable... the sights were unseeable... I plan on getting more DMT in hopes to see this girl again... it's like a real but fake love....

"My first and last DMT trip
This event occurred roughly 4 years ago now and I would like to write about it for the first time. 
As many of you know, it is hard to recall a DMT trip afterwards as your brain seems to want to delete the memories ASAP like it does with dreams, being aware of this before hand I decided to record the experience on a Dictaphone (sadly I've lost the recording but played it back so many times the account is still clear in my mind).

I got interested in DMT because I watch the Joe Rogan podcast, this led me to an audio of Terence McKenna talking about the experience and I basically decided not trying it was going to be impossible... So I got some.
I was scared, but well prepared! I Layed my spare mattress out onto the floor of my living room, dimmed the lights, loaded my spoon pipe with about 50mgs of the yellow stuff and,  set it on a heat proof mat so I could just smoke it and drop it there. 

Before blast off I decided to mix some of the DMT into a greengo cigarette (it's a herbal alternative to tobacco) and smoke that as a tester. After a couple of tokes I noticed my heart rate speed up a bit, then a peculier feeling of distance from reality set in, it was as if I was looking at a 2D portrait of my living room while the notion that it was not real came over me, my minds voice was saying ""oh, it's all bullshit isn't it"". It wore off and I promised my toe another dip in the water. 
Toke two yealded much the same experience but this time I had gone slightly further and my body seemed to buzz violently, I couldn't tell where my body finished and the water I felt like I was in started. 

The time for practice was over.

I got myself into a laying down position leant over the heat proof mat and took three big inhalations in what I would describe as an aggressive smoking style and then lay back down.

The first thing I noticed aside from the same body buzzing and the same 2D image experience was that now my 2D image of the room was covered in a water mark effect in the shape of triangles, geometrically perfect and noticeably sharp in resolution, the edges of these triangles met on either side forming a circular pattern, one row of triangles sat inside the other with the apex of the inner circles meeting at the edges of the triangles in the circle above like a mandala. Before I could take stock of how perfect they where I noticed that I had totally lost contact with the room and with that the triangles took on a quality of golden sunshine only now made of pink and purple light, this light shone brightly on my body and I could feel it penetrating and dissolving my remaining connection with my body (which I was strangely fine with). All of this was experienced along side a sound, almost like a choir of a thousand people signing one very high note constantly like ""aaaaaahhhhhh""

This trip was to come in stages like scenes in a movie, so with the pink and purple triangles of love and understanding out of the way it was time for a darker turn. I felt as though for a moment I had not existed and now I was just one with the earth, in the ground and part of it at the same time, I could feel the roots in the trees as if they were a part of me and I could see a source of light coming down through the cannopy of the leaves. Suddenly, I was aware of A presence, not one but several, I could not see them but I remember feeling very strongly that knew them very personally and I somehow felt overwhelming compassion and love coming from them. I hurtled towards the light and as I went I could feel them pushing me from behind I turned to look at one of them just before getting to the light. It was a girl made of blue light and she smiled at me.

I was now in a new space. The first thing I remember thinking very clearly was ""oh yeah! of course! this place! Why do I always forget about this place when I'm down there (in a body)"" this new space had a very familiar feeling to it, as though I had spent more time there than I am capable of concieving and in some way I am always there I just don't know it. 
I quickly became aware of another entity that I seemed to be telepathically connected to in some way, this one was very neutral in nature and did not seem to notice me much to start off with a kind of ""oh yeah your there, okay"" attitude, then it was as if he got a call from head office to tell him that I had taken some drugs which enabled me to see him and he became very interested in me, a bit like a double take. I was now getting a visual on the entity which I call the mantis being, very insectoid in nature with repeating geometric shapes for horns on his head but I could not see his face, He seemed to be above me and to the left a bit with his large forelegs (also made of geometric shapes) dangling down towards me while they danced around. 

What followed was a telepathic dialogue between me and the mantis being, basically as soon as I had thought of something to ask or say the answer or response had been instantly downloaded in concept form into my brain. I will do my best to convey the conversation...
Mantis: ""we're going to look right inside you now"" (said with an air of, I know this is going to be uncomfortable for you but we have to do it anyway).
Me: ""Ok, be gentle?""
(With that the arms of the mantis seemed to penetrate the area where I was)
Me:""I was that guy"" (a complete concept of who I am in this life was summed up into a feeling of familiarity for myself that I have never felt before and with it came the realisation and acceptance that it is now over)
Mantis: ""confirmed, that is who you where"".
Me: ""And I did well, I was a good person""?
Mantis: ""Your doing alright""(a feeling of neither excelling nor failing).
Me: ""Why is there mystery surrounding the female energy"".
Mantis: ""Don't worry about that"" (with his response came a feeling of corrupted files being deleted from my mind like the mantis was performing routine maintenance).
Me: ""Is my body OK""?
Mantis: ""Your body is fine"".

I could now feel the bed sheets between my right thumb and finger and I began to feel my body, as I returned to ordinary reality I continued see trails of pink and purple sun light on everything for a good 10 minutes, I felt giddy euphoria mixed with a lonliness, but lonliness only in comparison to the intense connectedness I had just felt.

For me, it was amazing and life changing. The only reason I havnt been back since is that I don't want to spoil it. The memories are too fond to spoil with a lesser experience.",2

For those of you with little background in biological sciences, I'll give a brief summary.           Scientists essentially grew brains (cerebral organoids) because testing on humans is difficult. They found that when treated with 5-MeO-DMT, the proteome (the proteins that are expressed/translated in the neurons) is significantly altered in a way that inhibits neurodegeneration and enhances neuronal health. In conclusion, this drug changes gene expression in a beneficial way.

"DMT trip report (E.T. Contact)
I deeply inhale and hold the hit in as long as I can while leaning back into the couch sitting in half lotus...

A voice whispers to me from behind my right ear, but coming from inside my head. ""This will be the most amazing thing you ever see, do not give into astonishment."" This cues me to go into a meditative state. 

(I have practiced meditation everyday for 10 years and have had over 100 lucid dreams. I feel this was important to note as I remember more about this experience than anyone I have ever talked to.)

At that moment the sound of a massive vortex like engine kicks on inside my stomach (I believe this to be the activation of kundalini energy). I feel as though I fall right out of my body 20 feet below the couch and bounce on the worlds largest trampoline before being blasted straight out of the top of my head at 100,000 miles an hour through interstellar space into a brilliant tunnel of white light. 

The inside of the tunnel is miles wide and the walls lined in 360 degrees with floating beings who are chanting ""It is so good to see you!"" and ""You are doing so well!"" ""We haven't seen you in so long."" There are millions of them and to me they appeared as bodhisattvas or what some I believe would see as angels.

I drop out on the other side of the tunnel and immediately remember. ""Oh this is the place in between lives."" I think I have been here many many time before. For what feels like trillions. Something shifts inside me and memories start to flood back of past lives. As I glance around I am floating through outer space. In the back ground I see golden nebular clusters forming stars and deep reddish purple hue's of sky mixed in with the pure blacks of outer space. Buildings far more advanced than anything I can remember float in the sky like giant pyramids with illuminated edges in every fluorescent color. 

Then I notice two shape shifting beings kind of bouncing around. Little creatures maybe 3 - 4 feet in height, but with no real defined figure. They can tell I am not afraid of them, but just curious and happy to be there. In turn I can tell they are very curious and happy to see me. They are surprised that I am so aware of them. They are multi-colorful and expressing colors we do not have in this dimension. They were playing instruments that produced strange crystalline sounds more beautiful than anything I have ever heard. It seemed more real than this reality.

I ask them ""What do you do for work here?"" 

(I ask this, because in this reality I have found it difficult to find balance between spiritual development and maintaining the things I must to fit into society.) 

They explain telepathically. ""Well.. we don't have to work, because we don't have physical bodies to feed or house. This allows us time to work on spiritual development and pursue studying what is fun and interesting to us."" At that moment it cues me to look down at my own body. I am nothing, but translucent golden light and I can see straight through myself. I realize that I am completely detached from my physical 3rd dimension body. 

I spin around as I am approached by a 3rd being floating my way. This being was enormous and almost completely translucent except for a white outline. It was at least 100 feet across or more and 50 feet in height. It seemed untethered to any concrete sense of form. I was completely at ease and felt very honored to be in the presence of that being. 

Communication was telepathic and perfectly concise. I had many questions and curiosities. As soon as a thought or curiosity arose, in the most succinct way the information would be uploaded into my mind via flashes of light accompanied by images and text perfectly woven together in a way that was easiest for me to understand while giving me the applied knowledge to best integrate it into improving my life.  

At one point this being chose to freeze time in my 3rd dimension reality to express that in our dimension we perceive one note as one individual sound, but that beings of the next dimension up could perceive one note as 10,000 individual sounds...the next dimension up 1 note = 100,000 individual sounds. It expressed that there were beings who could perceive 1 note as 100,000,000,000 (one hundred billion individual sounds.)

I wanted to know what the most important thing was about life. The being expressed, the most important thing is to have respect for all life and refrain from killing. This is universal law number one to accord with harmony. 

The base code of the universe is that all life is equal and should be treated with the same respect you want shown to your own life or the person that matters the most to you. All life is one giant entity in the same way that you are not one thing, but in fact 100 trillion organisms operating under a collective consciousness...in this same way all humans, animals, insects, and everything in between is all one universal organism operating under a collective consciousness that we all simultaneously are co-contributing to, despite this fact at this point in our evolution we perceive ourselves as fragmented and separate from one another. 

This is the reason wars continue and the senseless slaughter of animals in concentration camp like conditions. The reason why homelessness and starvation have not yet been eradicated.

This is the final message from this journey as I feel my time in this place winding down I exit the tunnel back to inhabiting my human body. Whilst returning I open my eyes and say to my two friends that are sitting in the room with me. ""The 5th dimension it is here it is now it has always been here it is always with us. It is the place that exists in between moments.""

I leave you with this...but don't take my word for it. Only know something as truth when you have thoroughly examined it through every lense of your own understanding.",1

"Wanking on DMT
Me and my good friend dimethyltryptamine have been getting to know each other very well, for quite some time now. I've got shit loads of it and a lot of time on my hands to explore it. So I've been vaping it once or twice a day (30-100mg, usually around 50mg), maybe every other day, just whenever I fancy it really. It's gone from being overwhelmingly intense trips to completely manageable and controllable experiences - If I want to talk to elves I can choose to, if I wish to fly the cosmos all I have to do is think it, if I want to vape 50mg+ with my eyes open and remain conscious/awake I can. 

One of my first ever *breakthroughs*, I came back to my body with an overwhelming sexual energy. I was literally rolling around having a full body orgasm (I am male), cumming my brains out. I put my hand down there to check if I jizzed in my pants (luckily I hadn't), however I noticed the texture of my junk felt completely alien and strange. I whipped it out and it looked like a cartoon, kind of rubbery looking just the way it felt. ""Strange…"" I thought. 

Over the last few months I have tamed the dmt, I am able to fully explore this wonderfully novel compound all the way, and see everything there is to see. And no, to my surprise there're no alternate dimensions. It's all in your brain. So just like other substances, I thought it'd be fun to have wank on it. Why the fuck not, right? Acid wanks are heavenly, dmt wanks have got to be amazing too.

This was last night/this morning around 1:30am. I start getting everything ready, I get a long porn compilation up that's over an hour long so I can just let it play and do my thing. Keeping focused is the hardest part, theres nothing sexy about smoking through a freebase pipe - I'm there with my cock out, hard, hitting just over 50mg of dmt. As I'm hitting it my Richard is going down, so I'm tryna keep jerkin a little while I hit it and it's just a mission. I must have looked like a depraved crack head at this point. 

I take it all in. I'm holding my breath and dicks not staying up, at some point I fall back and give up on the wank/ forget I was mastubating in the first place. My brain goes off on a deeply philosophical tangent: I thought I had figured out how the universe came to be (as ya do), I start shouting ""OHHH SHIT! OH FUCK! IVE GOT IT! OH MY FUCKING DAYS!"" - the time's 2am and my bro is asleep in the other room. I think he had work fairly early this morning too, sorry brosky… I remembered it was late, that I was shouting, tripping balls with my cock out with some pretty savage porn playing in the background. For a moment I thought ""shit, I've woken him up. He's gonna think I've gone crazy. He's gonna walk in and see me."" So I curled up in a ball laughing my arse off, whispering to myself ""sorry, sorry, sorry I am so sorry, I need to be quiet, I really need to be quite"" over and over. 

May I just say, the visuals were spectacular. I was painting with tracers - my hand was the brush and the air was my canvas. Never seen anything like it, they were staying there for minutes. My eyes were open the whole time, some crazy shit was going on in my room. It distracted me from the jerk sesh, but fuck it, still a pretty dam good trip. Although I'm going to have to explain a little to my bro what was happening, not the wanking (thats weird), just that I was tripping balls.

Has anyone else attempted the dmt-wankathon? If so, how did it go?",1

"0.1g DMT Trip - Enlightenment
So yesterday I used my wax dab setup with a domeless quartz nail to hit DMT.. I waited for about 7 seconds after the glass was no longer red to drop the DMT into the domeless quartz nail..

I finally broke through unlike anything I ever experienced. I am now convinced we were created by very advanced beings and will be with them one day. DMT was created by them as a way of communication.. An award of sorts. They knew that once we reached a point in our evolution that we would discover this. 

All problems in life now seem pointless and meaningless. I now know I have something to look forward to when I die. The feeling of love,  emotional communication, purity of heart , limitless knowledge etc. They showed me why people can be so terrible and why all should be forgiven. How it's not really their fault just like it's not a child's fault for misbehaving. We are a young ignorant civilization but we were made with a guarantee to reach their potential.. if there is ever a point in the future where we could destroy ourselves they will intervene then but unless that happens. We are on our own.

"I was a sitter for a friend while he smoked some DMT. It was an interesting experience.
He was not a first timer. He does a lot of drugs, a lot of the time, actually. But, any way.  
  
He took some DMT and weighed out a tenth of a gram. Then put it onto a folded length wise stiff dollar bill. Then we took a dab rig (the kind used to smoke THC concentrates) with a titanium nail and took a blow torch to it.  
  
After getting the nail glowing white hot he slowly sprinkled the DMT onto the nail and it all vaporized instantly on contact turning into a thick yellow smoke that smelled like a shoe store. He took it all with one deep breath then I took the rig from his hands so he wouldn't accidentally drop it while blasting off.  
  
After about 30 seconds he got a look in his eyes like he was looking very far away at something. Then he tried to stand up and tried to walk across the room. I put my hands on his shoulders so he'd stay put and then I told him he was OK a few times.  
  
I noticed that he wasn't breathing. So, I was afraid if he kept standing and kept holding the hit in/holding his breath that he'd just black out and fall over. So, I managed to sit him back down then I told him to just relax and breathe.  
  
He eventually exhaled the hit and then looked directly at me. He got a confused look on his face so I just smiled at him and nodded my head to let him know I was just his friend (even if he probably couldn't recognize me) and that it was all good.  
  
Finally he closed his eyes and clenched his fists. Then he started to cry. While he was crying it made me sad and I stared to get choked up. I pat him on the back a few times. Then he said, ""Why does it hurt so much to love?"" Then he said that again about three more times.  
  
After a few more minutes he was down from the trip and back in our reality.  
  
He asked if he said anything and I told him the one and only thing he said. He replied, ""Wow, that's some deep shit.""  
  
I asked him what he was thinking about/seeing when he said that and he said he recalls thinking about his family and how much he loves them.  
  
The whole experience was probably only five to ten minutes tops. But, it was all so intense it felt longer.  
  
The amount of the trip you actually remember vs. how long the trip actually takes seem like you must forget a lot of it. Kinda like how you forget most of a dream shorty after you wake up.  
  
I just thought I'd share this for anyone that was interested. If you're still reading thanks, thanks. Also, never forget. You are loved. :)

"My Issues With DMT Forums: It's not the Hogwarts of psychedelics, my dudes.
The most important thing to be gleaned from the ""Scientists are creating a DMT machine"" article: 

>His warning is this:
“Excessive use of Dimethyltryptamine can put you into a manic headspace where you think that you're the messiah who's supposed to spread the gospel of what you've learned,” he says, “to say, I’ve met the aliens, I know everything, I’m an ultra genius, let me heal the world.”
>

If I had a choice to be taken to the doctor in a 3rd world country or in America but DMT smokers will decided the course of action, I'm going with the 3rd world country, because they will be more realistic with their approach to medicine. 

Just because you've smoked DMT like 20 times doesn't mean you know anything about what it's about. The sheer folly in any human being truly believing they grasp the actual reason for DMT existing is absolutely bonkers. 

If someone states they are having real world issues after smoking DMT, such as experiencing waking hallucinations, it's not time to talk ab out how this one time at band camp you talked to God and she said you were a spirit chakra warrior and then you looked around and the room was bathed in white light and all of that is totally real because it was DMT.

That person might need (I KNOW GET READY FOR IT) grounded advice. Like from adults. And like maybe from adults who are professionals.

If you are hearing voices during the time you aren't on DMT, and you are starting to feel like you are losing your identity to the DMT space, it's a matter of pointed urgency you start curtailing your usage of psychedelics. Getting high can wait. 

Things DMT is not proven to be: 

• Ouija Board
• Gateway to spiritual realms you can't understand
• The Answer™
• The ok kind of spirituality that makes sense vs the other kinds people aren't allowed to associate with DMT such as Christianity, Judaism or Islam 
• The Truth™

Things that DMT is: 

• An endogenous tryptamine that when introduced exogenously makes you hallucinate and think things you don't normally think


It's a really short list.


If someone is actually having a hard time, you are obligated to either really empathize (which, you know, you're getting so heady dready I thought empathy for others would be the thing) and not just read a two word phrase from their post and then go post

> This reminds me of the time I told the light being of Kor Zur that I was a representative of Rainbow Battalion 40 Lamda, then this purple figure cruised overhead singing the song of Tamunjhikra and it was that day that I knew I was to heal everyone in Bowman, Montana with my sacred vibey cozy womb space in the land of Chakra Dakra, holy scribe of Pu Pu, the conundrum of the Western Boot Pool.

"Weird experiment I tried with DMT, you should try it and let me know your experience.
Done DMT 4 times and broken through the last three times.

I wanted to see how my body would handle DMT right after waking up from a dream. 

I usually wake up at 9am but instead I set my timer for 6:30am so as to wake me up hopefully in the middle of a dream cycle. I set my 'machine' on the night stand ready so all I had to do was take the 2-3 big hits it usually takes me to breakthrough. 

I woke up to the alarm at 6:30 and I had been dreaming about how i was at a pizza restaurant and random people there kept trying to steal a greek salad I had ordered.

The second I realized I had woken I went for the machine, and mind you I was pretty groggy.

I took 3 big hits to ensure a breakthrough. 

It's going to be hard to explain what happened and how it felt, but here it goes.

I was racing through a tunnel of space and light but then suddenly   I felt a feeling I had never felt before. 

It felt like my skin was pulling into a million different directions at once, in the best way possible. And my eyes no longer existed, I thought i could physically feel them hanging out of their sockets.. but also in a good way.

Then I saw a vision of an electric stallion running towards me and it looked like it ran over me and knocked me into a visual of being surrounded by the greek gods and goddesses and they all turned their backs to me and then one of them, I think it was Zeus, turned around and handed me a greek salad and that almost instantly dropped me in a seemingly direct copy of the dream I had just before smoking. It almost made me repeat the dream perfectly as how it had been but this time I was completely aware that it was a dream and get this, I was able to Lucid Dream for what felt like almost 2 hours (i checked, it had only been 20-25 minutes.) 

Anyone who has delved into lucid dreaming before knows that it's pretty hard to lucid dream for long amounts of time because if you excite yourself too much you can kick yourself out of the dream. This didn't happen, I really felt like I almost couldn't excite myself out of the dream. I had a blowjob that was so vivid and real and felt like it lasted a while. It was crazy.

I tried this again one morning and the same thing happened.

I think DMT could help you lucid dream. Let me know if you try.

"DMT guru Dr. Rick Strassman, father of psychedelic studies, has halfway lost his mind
I want to talk about DMT and evidence. There's a TL;DR at the end. 

So ... as you all know ... Dr. Rick Strassman administered 400 doses of DMT to volunteers at the Univ of New Mexico from 1990 to 1995. Despite much skepticism, it was done safely, and he found no huge negative effects to the subjects, and lots of good ones. 

This had a big impact on me personally. ... When I was first thinking of taking ayahuasca, in 2007, and I had no idea what it was: if it would be like dropping my brain in a NutriBullet or a cotton candy machine. A friend pointed me toward Strassman's studies. I read every word. The lack of obvious negatives convinced me to try. 

Well, you've all been there. The first time I did aya, it felt like my brain split into three horizontal sections and slid on top of itself, making new connections. Then the universe opened up, I flew toward the center of all light then shot down a dark wormhole into my self, yada yada yada ... you've all been there I know. 

But when I came to, despite that intense trip, I felt no negative effects, and many good ones. My cerebellum and cerebrum seemed relatively similarly situated, and I was drooling and babbling no more than normal. :)  And ayahuasca, after many more sessions, helped me quit drinking and open up to my girlfriend and helped ameliorate my depression way better than any pharmaceutical and helped convince me to do therapy, which really helped, too. 

Strassman's findings seemed confirmed. 

For years, Strassman was my boy, my guide, my trump card. People'd ask me: how do you know ayahuasca is safe? And I'd say, ""Of course I don't know FOR SURE it's safe, but it helped me. But don't take my word for it, read this Strassman study. 400 doses and not a single person dove off a building or scratched their eyes out because they thought there were bugs. And lots were helped."" 

Anyway.  I'm not sure I can use him as a source anymore. Or not with such a clear voice, because I saw him talk in Boulder this past weekend. And I read through some of his new book, ""DMT and the Soul of Prophesy."" 

Man, is he different now. He kinda comes off like a dude on a street corner holding up a cardboard sign. 

He's all about the Hebrew bible and how the godly visions in there are different from the godly visions on DMT. I can't explain it much better than that. I'm not sure he can, either. It seems like he's trying to say that the visions the old testament prophets saw are real and the ones you see on DMT are just inside your own brain. Which, just seems impossible to assert. How could he possibly know who god talks to or not? Does he have god's monthly Verizon bill? Does he live next door to god and so sees Him come and go? 

The subtitle of his book is ""A New Science of Spiritual Revelation in the Hebrew Bible."" Which is just so oxymoronic, bordering on straight up moronic. There is zero science in the book, or maybe, better said, a statistically insignificant amount of science. 

Worse, I took my highly logical, highly scientific, appropriately skeptical partner to see him talk. She's only done ayahuasca once, and she's on the fence about its safety and usefulness. Then she heard Strassman mumble and stumble through his largely pointless talk, then babble about the Hebrew bible and prophesy. Then, afterward, my partner is like, ""Do you think he's so spacey and incoherent and all over the place because he did too many drugs?"" Implying, of course: ""Do you think you'll end up brain-fried if you don't quit pretty soon?"" 

[As an aside (if anyone's still reading this post at this point, and cares to comment) ... does anyone think you can fry your brain if you do too much ayahuasca / DMT? Is he just a one-off nut, or is his weirdness a data point?]

Anyway, it was such a kick in the stomach. I had taken my partner to Strassman because I thought he would talk good scientific sense and speak plain English my partner could hear. Instead he's ""scientifically"" analyzing the burning bush, practically counting up the ""begats"" to know how old the Earth is. 

So after the talk, feeling aggravated, I talked to Strassman. I started nicely. I said, ""Big fan of your early work. You changed my life. But you've changed, man. You were one of my science guys, my intellectual backups, my medical mensch. Now, you're doing something that is so wildly unscientific. You probably hear this all the time, but, with this new spiritualist bible parsing, do you worry you've muddled some of the bedrock psychedelic science?""

He responded in a surprising way, saying that he thinks it is science to read the bible and compare the ""experiences"" of the ""prophets"" to the DMT trips of his subjects. I said he can do whatever he wants, but it's not science, and he shouldn't try to pass it off as science. You can't have a research subject who's been dead for 3000 years and once almost killed his own son on a mountaintop. ""It is science,"" he said. ""Is not science!"" I said. ""Is so science!"" he said. ""Nuh uh!"" I said. ""Yeah huh!"" he said. It was very advanced discourse. 

This isn't such a huge deal, of course. Science's findings are valid no matter what kind of wingnut advances them, as long as they can be repeated and are falsifiable. And anyway Strassman is far from our only source. Now we have Jordi Riba and lots of other real science being done, with FMRIs and amazing conferences etc., with Strassman off reading his Hebrew somewhere in a corner. 

But Strassman's turn is unfortunate, at least for me. Why'd the dude go so far around the bend? Is it possible that too much DMT / ayahuasca helped push him around the bend? This is our concern, dude. 

TL;DR -- A semi-famous scientific DMT researcher is now peddling weird biblical exegesis; hide your DMT-skeptical friends from him.

TLDR at the end.

I'm telling this story to counter all the ""DMT is light and beautiful and happy"" talk. Sure, it can be, and most of my experience with it has been great, but as I witnessed last night, it can also be absolute hell (for those with a certain mindset).

Some background info: this kid is 20-something years old, more into cocaine and booze than psychedelics (but did 3 tabs of acid one time so he thinks he's Terrence fuckin McKenna... the ego on that one, I swear!) I thought DMT might humble him, maybe make him realize he doesn't actually know diddly, and I'm pretty sure it did...

So I teach him how to hit the pipe, and warned him he might want to take a small hit first, to get a feel for it. He literally *laughed* at my suggestion before taking his hit, and I as I watch the pipe fill with a huge amount of thick, milky smoke, I know he's screwed. I saw the fear in that boy's eyes before they rolled back, and I said ""just let go, man"" because I can tell he was freaking out before it even really hit him.

This is what he told me when he came to: he saw reality twitching, and geometry spread throughout his room, he liked the visuals so he didn't want to close his eyes (I personally think he was overwhelmed and didn't want to admit it, but that's what he says). 
Then he felt like his eyes were being forced shut, and when I said ""just let go, man"" my voice echoed and distorted so badly in his head it became the voice of some sort of alien. He said he was then confronted by a massive wall of fractal geometry, fell into a maze-like system of rooms, and was locked into one room by an entity he never saw, he said he was in this room for most of the trip, and it felt like an eternity.

A condescending ""voice"" was showing him fractal images, and said something along the lines of ""This is all you wanted anyway, right? Pretty colors? Is it *trippy* enough for you?"" It sounded like he was put at the DMT version of the kids table, they wouldn't let him go further. He said he felt like he was not welcome there, that they called him out on his shit (he did not elaborate on what his ""shit"" was) and that he wasn't allowed back.
He was then violently hurled back to reality backward through a dark, swirling tunnel before opening his eyes again.

He came back looking somewhat ashamed and scared out of his damn mind, asking me how the hell I took 3 hits when 1 did all this to him, he thought he died and went to hell. I hope he learned something from it at least.

TLDR: Arrogant friend thinks he's a master psychonaut because he did LSD once. Takes DMT and has his ass metaphysically handed to him by entities, says he's not welcome back to hyperspace, and thinks we're all insane for ever smoking this stuff.",1

"Can we please, please be more tolerant to those who don't believe in DMT mysticism?
Every time someone dares suggest that they do not believe in mysticism or shamanism in DMT trips they are dismissed as closed-minded. Every discussion leads to demands that we ""open our minds"" and read a catalogue of spiritual books.

This is even when we have read all these books, we have gone in with an open mind, and we came to the conclusion that DMT trips have a rational, scientific basis.

Obviously not all users, but so many posters here cannot fathom that another user can experience a profoundly powerful trip and still come to a rational conclusion.

Why is there such intolerance to those views? I just ask that people please be more accepting of alternative views to mysticism.

"Godhead told me to stop !
This was my 7th breakthrough and the most memorable one.
I've seen beauty beyond imaginable and felt indescribable love on DMT, but this was something different.

I was sitting by the ocean, enjoying the first day of Spring by myself. Took my little pipe with me, and enough DMT for one breakthrough.
I do a little meditation before smoking and promise to surrender completely to the experience. After the second hit, I feel very ecstatic and drifting to a white realm. This is when ""something"" at the center of my head starts pulsing very quickly. I'm being attracted to this radiant source of love, such a powerful magnet. I realize all geometric patterns and visions I've had on DMT, meditation are projected from there, but there is a membrane that separates me from it.
I want to merge with it, I can't resist it's radiance ! I just knew I belonged there, it was home. I don't know why, but the visions projecting from there at this point kind of resembled Alex Grey's art, specially the colors ! https://cdn.cosm.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Alex_Grey_Seraphic-Transport_Docking_on_the_Third_Eye.jpg
I can feel that I'm getting closer to the Godhead, the physical world feels so distant now.
This is when the trip changes !

The most loving female energy I've ever felt in my life, stops me and telepathically tells me ""I can't give you more or you won't go back"". ""Enjoy what I've created for you"" (physical world).
I realized that ""membrane"" exists for a reason, and somehow it's giving me the opportunity to be a human being.

The unconditional love and peace I was feeling is beyond words, so I just thanked this motherly presence for letting me get so close to the Godhead. Before leaving, she told me not to smoke anymore DMT, that She would let me know when I'm ready to go there again.

It's hard to describe these trips, specially in english. : )
I am so grateful for these experiences, but it ends for now. It's time to just spread the love !",1

"Embracing the Confusion/Madness
Last night, I decided to roll some dabs in DMT like nerds rope while I was relaxing and watching some Rick and Morty.

Although the hits were low doses since they were just ᶫᶦᶫ ᵈᵃᵇˢ, it allowed me to better assess the process of blasting off into DMT-land. 

I used to have more anxiety about DMT due to how confusing it can get, but the couple hits I took last night helped me to embrace that confusion. As my thoughts became more and more fragmented, this sudden feeling of ""WHOOHOO! I DON'T KNOW SHIT!"" washed over me as that confusion turned into excitement. I like to think of myself as somebody who's at least halfway intelligent, and I always try to push myself to learn more. I think all of my memories dissolving as my ego does is why I used to get scared when doing DMT. I was scared of not retaining all of the knowledge I had accumulated over my life.

However, having all of that temporarily stripped away and being excited about it resulted in such a relaxing time, even if I was only getting like 10mg per hit. I just felt pure love and contentment, and I didn't have a care in the world. I wasn't worried about my material possessions, I wasn't anxious or scared. All I could think about was how peaceful I felt.

Ignorance truly is bliss, but we sure as shit wouldn't get anything done if we chose to remain willfully ignorant for our entire lives. Embrace the pain just as much as you embrace pleasure, if not even more so. We don't grow without it.",

"My extreme first DMT experience last night. I need to share what just happened to me!
Hello friends :) to start I'm a 23 year old who's dabbled in mushrooms and LSD quite a bit from age 17 to now. 

NOTHING compares to what I experienced from DMT yesterday.  I weighed the dose out to .08 of a gram, used a dab rig and astral projected  harder than I could've imagined. Here's my experience:

DMT experience:

As soon as the hit was taken and held in for about as long as I could I felt a rush like I was being propelled through a tunnel or even in general at 1000 mph. All I could ""think"" when this was happening was ""OH SHIT"" (in a good way). It was the most intense experience, almost too intense at first for what seemed to be the first half of my experience, when in actuality it was probably about 5 minutes. I was resisting hard at first but when I decided to let go mentally my body eased out as well. It's super hard to explain but I felt like every molecule and particle in my body changed pace once I let myself go and started to pull themselves apart and re converge again.

 I don't remember the majority of the experience however I remember how my body felt very vividly. I heard voices but was too overwhelmed to really listen, it wasn't so much of a voice but a message so to say that just flew into my brain. At this point which was probably mid experience, I felt a crazy warm feeling take over me around my pelvic area and my hands felt unreal even though I made the association that they were in fact hands to my vessel.

 Whenever I opened my eyes it was SUPER intense, so much so that I kept closing them to calm myself down. I remember looking around and everything was a clusterfuck of colors, deep, warm colors and fractals that trailed and morphed. As I started to come to, I remember feeling super confused. I couldn't differentiate reality from the spiritual realm but was able to keep my eyes open for longer as it faded out. Then everything came together and I finally grasped my surroundings, licked my lips that felt burnt and tasted awful like the DMT. It took me about 10-15 more minutes to fully take in what the fuck just happened to me and I was completely unable to put into words what I truly experienced to my friends. They've done it before and knew how profound my experience was. I kept moaning out of pure ecstasy and amazement, as I was coming to, I felt like a calm, friendly figure carried me back to reality like a firefighter would carry out a passed out infant from a fire. It was a super calm feeling and I remember just being so thankful for the enlightenment that I just endured. I still can't put this experience into words as well as I'd like to, this is the day after. It was by far the most profound thing to happen to me ever and I can't imagine anything topping it.

 Today, the next day I feel like I just experienced a crazy traumatic (in a good way) experience. My views on life are different, I have a peaceful vibe and an extreme urge to spread this sacred knowledge. Can't wait to travel back.

Another thing that came to mind about the experience was ""I"" was constantly saying in my head, ""what is this, what is everything, I want to go back"" then a millisecond later something told me ""you are back, this is real"" and that repeated  what seemed like thousands of times. This eventually stopped but it was in the peak of my ego death. COMPLETE ego death. ",1
"My first time
I tried DMT for the first time a few months ago, and I've thought about it almost every day since. I think I'm finally ready to share my experience.

I'll admit it: I wasn't even very interested in trying DMT. If my friend hadn't brought some that night I wouldn't have bothered to seek it out. The idea of taking a trip that would only last a few minutes just seemed pretty pointless. Plus I'd dabbled with other psychedelics in the past, so I figured DMT would be nothing new.

Oh how wrong I was. 

I took the hit and laid down; immediately all I could see was a kaleidoscope of radiant colors bursting before my eyes. Then, I slowly became aware of this beautiful music, it sounded like a piano and a harpsichord combined. I wanted to ask my friends who was playing this awesome song (but of course was unable to speak), until I suddenly realized I was controlling the music! My brain was making the music just like it was producing those beautiful shifting colors, and I was in awe.

After a while, the music and colors gave way to clearer images. I saw that I was far above the earth, with an astounding view that only astronauts ever get to see in person. As I looked around I became aware that I was being cradled in the arms of a gigantic insect. I know that sounds really freaky, but I just focused on taking deep, calm breaths, and I knew there was nothing to be afraid of. I got the feeling that the insect loved me, and was also much much smarter than me. So I just chilled in its gigantic arms and enjoyed the beautiful view of earth.

That's when the best part of the trip occurred: my old dog showed up! He passed away a few years ago and I haven't had another dog since, he was such a good boy it's hard for me to consider getting another. I didn't see him like I saw other parts of the trip, but I distinctly felt his presence. I could feel him panting and sniffing at my neck and ears, it actually really tickled.

By this time, I was slowly but surely coming out of it. But I was in no rush to get up and get back to the party. I just laid there for a long time taking deep, happy breaths. I knew I probably looked weird to some other people in the room, but I realized that I just didn't care. They could think whatever they wanted to think about me, and it wasn't going to take away from the amazing experience I just had. 

Ultimately, that was my biggest takeaway: worry less about what others think of me. I'm usually a pretty insecure and sometimes even paranoid person; I've probably wasted countless hours stressing over what other people think. But in that moment, as I was coming off that trip, I realized with utmost clarity and simplicity that I needed to worry less about other people's opinions. I suddenly understood how my people-pleasing behavior did little good for others, while only hurting myself.

I try to remember that lesson and incorporate it into my everyday life. So far, I've been pretty successful!

Hey fellow temporary humans.

This is my first ever reddit post.
Figured I’d use it to say how blown away & grateful I am for all the positive human interactions DMT has brought me over the last year. I’m only now reaching the 1 year anniversary of my first breakthrough. 

The second I mention to someone that I finally achieved my breakthrough, they hug me & congratulate me. That’s a nice feeling.

It’s like having an instant connection with someone. They’re like “you get it, and I get it, and what we ‘get’ is that we know nothing of our existence”

I don’t know, I just wanted to articulate how grateful I am for all the love it’s brought into my life. That was an unexpected aspect of the experience. 

I look forward to reading the posts in this community using my best McKenna voice & hearing about people’s experiences. I’m sure I’ll post some of mine at some point.",1

Ive tried out surrounded by trees, and most recently I took it to the beach.  Looking at sand was incredible.  The sky and clouds as well, just beauty.

"First breakthrough...I'm speechless
So upon months of research and learning about the spirit molecule and other psychedelics, I managed to get a hold of some DMT through the deep web.

The first two times I did dmt I did not break through. The first time I had used a 2 liter soda bottle with the bottom cut off and foil placed over it to place the dmt on to heat it up and inhale once it filled the bottle. The 2nd and 3rd time I decided to use my dab rig (without any water) with a broken nail that I no longer had use for. The 2nd time like I said was not a breakthrough, only mild CEV's. However I definitely did NOT expect to break through on my 3rd attempt.

I emptied my lungs, poured the ever-so-valuable crystals onto my heated banger as I inhaled and got a taste of what I would describe as Footlocker topped off with an almost menthol-like taste.

I held the vapor in for about 7 or 8 seconds before my ears started to ring and everything in my vision began to vibrate. I let it out around the 15 second mark and I had a rush of energy that felt like I was hit with 50 tabs of LSD. Plopping back onto my bed with my eyes closed I was completely unaware of my existence in this world as I was thrust into a tunnel at supersonic speeds. The next thing I knew I was in a room where the walls looked like giant pixels constantly moving, changing sizes and colors all at once. Several other worldly entities/beings/spirits were there, all with constantly morphing faces and long arms that seemed to reach out to me. They were embracing me, showing interest in me. As I asked ""Who are you?"" they telepathically communicated to me that this was their world, that they had been waiting for me and they would ""show me the way"". They then took me on a journey across their realm, showing me unfathomably amazing things, things so out of this world I never thought would be even able to exist. One of them always assured me I was going to be okay whenever I got scared or wanted to ""go home"", and eventually placed its ""hands"" on my head to comfort me. It then fed me everything in its knowledge, and slowly returned me back to my body.

I opened my eyes and sat up, trying to process what I had just gone through. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever experienced, I felt nothing but pure love and happiness as I tried to recall the memories that were already fading fast. My words cannot do it justice. I was completely blown away by the fact that I could see something so profound, so amazing yet so mysterious at the same time. The whole experience became something I could not stop thinking about for a few days.

Because of the intensity of DMT I'm not going to be using it too often but it was definitely refreshing and offered me a new outlook on life. Ever since I was young I've wanted to experience all the human mind is capable of, and I have to say I had no idea we could experience something of that volume.",1
"Weirdest First Time DMT breakthrough ever.
So you will need a bit of a backstory. Recently I had done some things I'm not proud of and my parents found out and you know you sometimes just keep doing things and then suddenly you realize that what you're doing is like a very wrong thing to do and that's not really who you are at all.

Emotionally and mentally I've been very depressed with my circumstances and not at all proud of some things I've done in the past. I was emotionally paralyzed. 

You should also know that this is all of ours first time ever doing DMT and I've never done a psychedelic in my life before, besides weed but meh that don't even count.

I had read about the healing powers of DMT and thought to give it a try. I gathered four friends who were willing to do it with me since I didn't wanna do it alone and I definitely wasn't gonna go first cuz of the jitters. So lets call the first friend Donald J. Trump. It's decided that Donald is going first. We heat up the dab rig and measure out 50 mg of DMT. Heat up the quartz. Then waited around 20 seconds. I pour in the measured powder. He starts to pull. Holds it in for like 15 seconds and lets it out. I can tell he's feeling it. He asks me for water and I give him bottle and then he asks me what he should do with the bottles and I say drink it. He drinks, doesn't stop drinking for a weirdly long time and I go Donald you're still drinking the water. He says ""oh"". Then looks at his hands says ""wow"" and lays down. Eyes closed I know he's blasted off. He's breathing really deep. But later he's calm and smiling. His mouth and tongue were moving in a way as if he's talking to someone. About 15 minutes after he's starting to come back. He says on his comedown ""this reality we're in is just a holding cell we should really be there where I went today"" slowly he comes down and it's back to normal for him. But he says he feel differently about a lot of things in life now. He's really happy and he said everyone should experience this once. 

I whisper to my friend before the second person goes ""I honestly just wanna be in a better place mentally and emotionally kinda like a counseling session yaknow?""

Time for second person to go. She goes. Doesn't breakthrough but has an amazing time. Comes down describes it, same old.

Now it's my turn. Trust me this is going to be amazing.

My hearts beating really fast but I take a few deep breaths and calm myself while Donald trump heats the quartz. Wait for it to cool. He pours in a measured 50 mg, I pull. While I'm pulling I can feel time slowing down. I'm looking at Donald after I've taken the whole hit. I'm holding it in. Didn't feel very harsh at all. Somewhere between 15-20 seconds I exhale. Everything is really slowing down now. And I'm getting that feeling where your foot falls asleep but throughout my body and a lot stronger. I'm getting exhausted. I start to lay back. I'm laying down on my bed. Eyes closed. Ringing sound becomes very noticeable and I'm looking at a blue sun and then it happens the sun explodes into a million different patterns. I knew I had broken through. This was it. My friends all said I mumbled ""The greatest in the world"". Then someone speaks, not in a language I know but I understand. It says ""why are you here?"" I say ""I wanna be better"" and then it said ""Get up"". I try but can't. The entity realizes I'm unable to get up (as in my physical actual body).

And then the magic happens.

It says something along the lines of ""this universe is very beautiful but it's just that, beautiful, if you want meaning and answers and help with what you came for, get up."" Everything gets even more intense. It's like all the energy in that universe started to harness into a single point.

And then the hardest thing I have ever done *I get up*, open my eyes, stare at the wall right in front of the bed I was laying in blankly. Then I turn to the side and all my friends have their mouths gaping open and are like ""oh my god are you okay? Do you need anything?"" I ask how long it has been.

Donald trump answers **Barely a Minute** 

I'm stunned and then it comes back. A voice relaying messages to me telepathically not even actually speaking. 

It told me what needed to be done to make a change in my life. I know I'm still full on tripping because it has been only 3 minutes since I took a 50 mg hit with a dab rig. 

I think to myself ""how am I up and consciously aware of everything around me"" I could even talk to my friends. There were absolutely no hallucinogenic effects at this point but I knew I was still going because the voice was getting clearer and clearer and then, the voice talks back, *Because it's time for a change*.

I asked Donald trump to pass me a notebook that was laying down on my desk. 

He passes it to me. I try to raise my hand to get it from him and oh lord my hand was violently shaking and I just wanted to lay back down. Voice says again ""don't worry you'll be fine. Slow"" I grab the notebook somehow and pick up a pen. My hands are violently shaking so writing could be really hard. I start to write. And everybody is so surprised that I am physically doing this. 

The voice told me everything that I have to change in my life and it pointed out the mistakes I've made perfectly. I keep on writing.

It tells me to appreciate the ones who love me most and be more grateful for the things I have and it'll be fine. 

Then it's time to go. Had been close to 10-12 minutes at that point. The list is done. It's told me everything I need to know. So I lay back down and like close my eyes. And just like that I'm in this beautiful world and before I know it the voice implies something along the lines of ""you'll be fine never give up"". And that's it. It's over just like that.

I still can't believe I got up and wrote a list. Also have video and pictures of the list I wrote. Will update with them tomorrow.

Edit 1 - [Picture of List](http://m.imgur.com/8WkGBIF) 

Notice how bad the handwriting is? Hands were super shaky and it was the most physically tiring thing I ever did but I also know it was worth it for the help I got. As you can see I wrote on the back of the page as well. But that was a list of people I never wanna lose so I won't upload that. 

A lot of people will be offended by what I wrote on the paper. It was meant in the context that my subconscious was telling me god won't solve your problems you have to do that yourself. You have to make a change.

Lastly, I can upload the video from too but I'm not sure how to pixelate my face and downshift my voice so it's completely unrecognizable. If someone can help with that. Please contact me I would love to share my very conscious DMT trip with the world.

The situation isn't as critic as the other one, you can still be heard, but mods need to do something IMO because it is going in that direction.

The biggest problem:
-People spamming their astract artwork on here with the excuse that DMT told them to do it(If Dimitri told you to start painting that's great, I actually like those, but atleast give a short trip report)

I once saw a guy just spam 10 of his artwork with 0 context, they didn't even look like they had something to do with DMT...

Throwaway This may be long, so tl;dr I took some DMT.

Background

I just turned 44 less than a week ago.  I have done lots of LSD and psilocybin, at varying rates and intensities, since I was 17, but DMT was not on my radar until a few years ago.  My last trip on LSD was October 2017.  I do not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both have been out of my life for 8+ years.  Cannabis is a big part of my life, as it is the healing of the nation.  

I only began to hear about DMT 4-5 years ago.  it took that long for me to finally track some down, or for it to find me, however you look at it.  I'd been holding onto it for about a month, still trying to prep myself for this experience.  I acquired an oil burner for the vaping process and held onto that for like two weeks.  It was a slow build to say the least.  Finally, on this past Friday, I decided it was finally time.  I spoke to my wife about it (who already knew I was interested in trying) and got her blessing, and I told my buddy that actually found it for us to come on over.  (This friend also has never done DMT).

At around 10PM, after my kids had gone to bed and my house had settled down, it was time.  We went to my third floor, where my bedroom and a sitting area are combined, and I began to get things ready.

MISTAKE #1- I do not own a scale that can weigh to .00, only to .0 g.  Therefore, I am unsure how much to add to my oil burner.  I definitely put more in the burner than I needed to, probably by two fold.  I say this because there is still a jack ton melted in the bottom of the burner.  Lesson learned, for further trips, I will need to invest in a scale that is accurate.

Anyhow, I go to my bed and sit down on it.   I had been practicing lighting the oil burner prior, so I feel like I have that part down.  I try to take a hit, but I get nothing.  Second try, repeat, same results.  I'm maybe just scratching the surface, but definitely I have not taken a real hit yet.  I'm getting a little frustrated with myself, and my hands are starting to shake a bit from nerves.  I realize I need to hold the flame closer to the bottom of the oil burner, so I do, and instantly the bubble fills with vapor/smoke.  I take a big pull in, hold it while counting in my head to fifteen, and blow out.  I could taste it and knew it had worked.  Instantly the walls shifted and and pattern on my comforter started to rise and fall in geometric patterns.  I take a good deep breath, and go in for hit number two.

Hit number two was a doozy.  I mean a big ripper.  I held it in, and felt my arms drop.  I try to hand the pipe to my friend, and he brings it to my lips and tells me to clear the bowl, so I did.  As I inhaled, the patterns on the bed began to wrap around me and lay me down on the bed.  There was no ringing sound as many report.  By contrast, all sound dropped out to a complete and utter still.

(MISTAKE #2- I did not get a proper third hit in me.  I only cleared the chamber of what was left from my second hit on #3.)

I lay down, and as soon as I close my eyes, I hear a voice on my left side say ""okay, let's go!"" and I blast up and out of my body.  I was moving frighteningly fast upwards upwards upwards.  It was a lot to take in, and I'm not sure I recall what I saw, it was just the feeling of speeding away.  I was no longer who I recognize as me, but I knew it was me, if that makes sense.  Also, the entity that was taking me upwards was very familiar, a good friend I hadn't seen in 500 years.  I never ""saw"" this entity, not visually, but I could feel the presence, I knew it was there, and I knew it did not wish to harm me.  In fact, it was keeping me safe amused at my folly.  I could feel its bemusement.  

Flying ever higher, ever higher, I kinda start freaking a little.  ""I am so far away from my body, so far from me, I think this is far enough>""  The entity pushed on, until I hit a ceiling.  I bumped my head on the ceiling of this universe, and the being laughed at me.  Not like laughing making fun of someone, but kind of like, ""oh, you're such a silly guy.""  Hitting this ceiling definitely scared me, and I felt like a little rabbit, scared and running  back down the rabbit's hole to my body and to what I know as comfortable.  I thought of breathing and it kept me grounded to this space for a second.  Then the entity would say, okay, lets try again.  He would begin ramping me up, moving in a motion like a sea snake swimming to the surface, only to hit that surface, and me get frightened and pull things back a bit.  This happened three or four times, until finally, my travel companion said ""okay, this isn't working, lets try something new.""

And in a flash, I was immediately taken to what people call the waiting room.  This ""room"" was beautiful by design, super bright and ever changing.  The walls could not be still.  The entity was bringing me through the room, up to a corner on my right.  Every time we would ""turn the corner"" I would be brought back to the beginning of the room, taken up to the corner to turn, turn the corner, and be thrust back where I was.  This felt like it happened 50 or more times.  it wasn't uncomfortable, and i wasn't anxious, I just felt stuck, and i think the entity with me felt stuck as well.  I heard him say ""This isn't going to happen today, I'm very sorry, but you really did try, and I'm proud of you.""  He still seemed very jovial and lighthearted.  It felt as if he said next, ""just sit back and relax, and enjoy the show.  We have some work to do.""

And i was then treated to a show of unrivaled hallucinations.  There were multiple floating orbs around me, one that stuck out the most was made up of mazes that continuously rose and fell across the surface.  I realize eventually I am inside one of these orbs, also floating, orbs inside of orbs inside of orbs.  I was here, present in this space I had never been, but it was so comfortable to be there.

I then feel as if the entity began to do his work on me.  I felt fingers, or finger like appendages, penetrate into my soul, and like fingers on a keyboard, those fingers began to decode information.  The feeling was warm, loving, not uncomfortable at all.  As the being is in there, i could sense him once again laughing, as if to say ""oh you're so silly, why are you holding onto all of these things?""  And I could see those ""things"" being discarded.  As the work was being done, I could feel more warmth and more love entering into me.  I can't describe the feeling, it was very beautiful to experience.  As for the things that were being cleared from my data bank, I would not classify them as ""bad things"" (like feelings or memories) or ""good things.""  They were just things that I had been holding onto for whatever reason, and I did not need them any longer, if I ever needed them to begin with.  I did not recognize any of the discarded items for what they were, if they were memories or feelings or what, but I knew i did not need them any longer.  I do know that a lot of things were cleared, the entity spent what seemed like a long time rifling through all of the files. 

 He let me know that a lot of stuff had been cleared away, and that I will feel a change, but those things that he cleared away could just as easily be piled back on top again if I chose to let that happen.

Once the being was done, it said, ""okay, we have time for one more thing, come with me.""  I was brought back to my body, my ego had returned, but we stayed inside a spot in the front of my brain.  It drew a line that I could see from the front of my brain (I guess what some would call the Third Eye location, between the eyes and centered slightly up) to the middle of my brain, to this place of unlimited potential, so small and minute, but so powerful it can create worlds.  The being had me doing what I can only describe as mental backflips, through this tube that had been created, into this pool of bright white potential, for a long time it seemed.  I was once again told that there is a new pathway open, this time in my brain, and that I can access it to a degree any time, I already have the tools to do it, it only requires a bit of work on my part to keep that highway open.

I really started to come back to my senses after doing this for a while, the feeling of potential was waning, and tube was constricting and it was becoming clear I was coming down.  I heard my friend say from the other room ""it's been exactly 15 minutes.""  I lay there, eyes still closed, and over the course of what felt like 20 minutes, I hear my friend say ""it's been exactly fifteen minutes"" three more times.  

I thank the being , I thank the DMT, still laying there, and I stand up.  when I turn the corner into the other room, my friend says ""its been exactly 15 minutes.""  I asked him how many times he had said that phrase, and he said, only once, just now when you walked in.  I told him how many times i had heard it, even while still in the other room.  I feel that I was still in a hyperspace kind of place, where multiple worlds overlay themselves onto each other, and I was passing each of those until I got back to my own.

I began to unpack my adventure with my wife and my friend.  I told everything I could.  It's gotten a little easier to digest and i can explain the parts i remember better now.  Within one full hour, I felt like I was totally back here again and I could have even driven if I needed to. 

A few final points:

*Although I heard the entity and could understand it, it did not come off like a foreign or alien language.  it was more telepathic, not something i could hear, but something I could understand.  The being was purely whimsical and loving.  it meant no harm, and was surprised that I was scared at times.  I was never scared of it, I was scared of where I was, and that is what he found so funny.

*I also can't put a gender on the being.  it wasn't male or female.  it was as we all are, when broken down to our pure base without body parts that identify you.

*The places I went were very familiar.  Even though I did not breakthrough, I know I hit the barrier, and on the other side of that barrier was somewhere I knew very well .  I wanted to be there, i wanted to get there, but my own beating heart and my focus on my breath kept me from going there.  In discussion with my friend later, he said that even though I did not breakthrough in the the sense other people talk about, I did break through some worlds outside of me, and it feels like some breakthrough on the inside as well.

*I felt a mental clarity and an all over (inside and out) clean feeling after the trip.  Very hard to describe.  It is still there, and I find myself taking an extra mental step before I speak and act.  

*I think on my next experience, i will take a single hit, just to prime the engines, and then later (one or two hours) go for the full blown three.  I think it will help me ease into it.  Kind of like going to the amusement park and riding the small roller coaster before jumping on the one with a 5000 year climb and 40,000 loops that will send you spinning off to other dimensions.

*It was all love.  Everything in this experience, from the fear, to the cleaning, to the entity, was all love, or at least the feeling we have named love.  Love is the basis of all, it is the Alpha and Omega, it is the Ohm and it is the electric spark giving us life.  It is a ball of light in the middle of our chest, trying to escape and spread more love to others.  We put layers of thick black tape over that ball of light, unintentionally, by holding onto unnecessary attachments.  We hold onto the things that make us feel good, and many times we hold those things that we fear even closer to us.  To properly keep this love open to any and all, we have to learn to recognize our attachments for what they are.  It is not bad to have the attachments, we all have them, it is a fault of being human by design.  The bad is when we cling to them so tightly we can't let them go, which eventually hinders our development.

Thanks for listening, I know this was a doozy of a read.  Thanks to this community for their teachings and preparations you have given me.  I will check in with future reports as I have them, for posterity, you know.

"Having trouble smoking DMT?, this worked 100% for me.
Why dont u try the original sanwhich method? It worked perfectly for me, I broke through with one hit.

Just gotta be very precise.

1. Get a screen for tobacco pipe.

2. Get some herb(marijuana suggested), grind it finely and pack in bowl half way and press on it with finger tips to create a bed for dmt.

3. Load a fat ass amount of dmt.

4. Grind more herb finely and place all on top of dmt. Press it again with finger tips to where it feels compressed. Then put more herb on top. 

5. Now this is the most important part. When ur going to light it up with the lighter, u HAVE to let it just hover above the herb while ur hitting it. DONT take a direct hit with the flame, let the heat from the flame fire the herb up, and as ur herb is smoking up and burning, put away lighter and hit as smooth, slow, but hard as u can. Then its blast off. ",1

"""You're an ignorant creature, but that's okay""
I'll try to keep this brief, and I understand if it's too long. I just want to share this with you guys and gals.

Last night I had the most beautiful and humbling experience with this substance yet. I was with a friend of mine, who had never tried dmt before, and really wanted to experience it, and I was happy to oblige.

We started off with a lower dose, about 25mg, as they had only tried LSD before this. They knew nothing could prepare them for the experience. I went first to demonstrate, and to ease their nerves, and show them first-hand that there is nothing to be afraid of, that this substance has nothing but humble and beautiful, albeit strange experiences to offer.

We saw the typical ""chrysanthemum"" as I like to call it. Rotating prisms of pattern and color, like the most immense and complex kaleidoscope ever, along with the beautiful rush and euphoria that comes with it. They were excited to go deeper, and I was overjoyed.

We waited an hour, while I answered any questions they had. We weighed out 60mg each, and again I went first. While it wasn't my most intense experience to date, it was more beautiful than any before.

The colors rushed in, and began spiraling in a way words can't describe. I began lifting out of reality, as the carrier wave rushed in, I heard the vibrating frequency increase in volume and pitch until it resonated my whole body, as is usual with my experiences. The visions crashed into my being, and I was swept away. An orb of complex geometric patterns came rushing towards me. The orb was much larger than I anticipated, almost planet-sized. When I crashed into it, my speed increased immensely as I was being summoned to the core.

When I arrived, I was greeted by an entity of incredible size. Neither male nor female, it had eight arms with two hands on each arm. It had three eyes, two mouths and a crown. It welcomed me with a smile, and it began communicating with me via emotions and thoughts. This was its home, and it was going to teach and entertain me while I was there. Four of it's arms created a sphere around me, like a cocoon. They were made of light and glass, reflecting wild patterns and colors. The other four arms were creating the most beautiful gem I had ever seen. Words can't describe the complexity of it. There were colors I had never seen before, colors we don't have words for.

I was slightly aware of my body, though it was distant. Tears were streaming down my face, and i was in complete awe of what I was witnessing. The entity then began twisting and morphing as it pushed the gem against my forehead, my third eye chakra. The rush was soothing and cleansing, intense amd comforting. Then, clear as day, I felt it say ""you're a beautiful, yet ignorant creature. You know nothing. But that's okay. Love is everywhere. Follow it and you will thrive."" It hugged me and said farewell.

The afterglow was so special. I felt like I was cleansed inside and out. I still feel it. I'm not sure what to take away, or what to think of the entity I met, but I'll certainly be following love for the rest of my life.

As for my friend, their spirit was taken on a wild ride through a bismuth-esque landscape of colors and patterns. Complex movement beyond words. Beauty. Altogether a successful night!

tl;dr  breakthrough experience, eight-armed entity told me I was beautiful, but ignorant and that's okay. Follow love and you will thrive.

Peace.",1
"Thinking of sharing my Sous Vide MHRB Tek, anyone interested?
Hey everyone!

Just wanted to see if there might be interest here for my MHRB extraction tek, with pictures (based off of Cybs' Hybrid ATB) that includes some efficiency/yield improvements. The most notable difference is that I use a temperature controlled water bath to warm the bark mixture. This can be achieved with either a precision cooker or a common crock pot, among other things. Having a controlled bath is much less destructive to the final yield than trying to guess at the temperature by heating/cooling on a stovetop. There are also some slight adjustments to other quantities and procedures relative to Cybs' tek. I achieve close to 2.5\-3&#37; yield in ideal conditions. If there seems to be even a few people interested I'll write out the tek and post here in the next few days.

"Hypothesis - Doing DMT makes you a stronger person because you conquer the fear of the unknown when you decide to smoke DMT.
This sub is full of threads about fear, anxiety, depression, and the general dis-ease of modern Life.

Many of the people here feel that pain acutely, and resolve their minds to make a change. They study how to make and ingest DMT, empower themselves to take action, and exercise care and patience in extracting their spice.

Many spend days, weeks, months preparing mentally, practicing breathing, and meditating on their demons.

Then the day arrives, you set about the ceremony with intent and show respect and humility in your search for answers and help. You stare down at the pipe, unsure of what to expect and nervous.

By the time you've exhaled the third hit, you've done something most people never muster the courage or resolve to do. The amazing otherworldly experience *might* be secondary to the process of getting there...",0

"Made a little picture after I was inspired by all the other DMT-artists on here:)
",
"Aliens spoke to me while I was on DMT. They communicate telepathically using your voice to answer your questions. I will explain what happened.
So here goes, my friend had some DMT, we were drinking and a little high and he and his cousin were telling me about it, what happens, what it feels like etc etc.

After a while my drunken and slightly high state thinks it would be a good idea to try this, my friend suddenly remembers that he had some upstairs and asked if I wanted to. I hadn't heard any bad stories about this and was told by my friend that 20 minutes after taking it, I would be back to normal. This did happen, as he said, but the experience was nothing like what they said it would be.

I took the DMT in a water bong, known as a 'fucket' which is a plastic bottle with a hole in it filled with water, when the hole is released, the water pressure sucks the smoke through the gauze. I think he'd given me a big hit and said as soon as I hoofed it, to go and lie down and they would stay outside the room to avoid affecting the high, and also to ensure I didn't die or some shit.

As soon as I hoofed it I walked 5ft into the room and lay down. I was told to hold it in but it was so strong I immediately exhaled when lying down and here goes....

When I exhaled I saw a spectrum of lights and colours unlike anything I have ever seen before. If there are 2d and 3d images, this looked like it was 6d. There were spirals where each fibre of the spiral was producing another spiral. In a way it looks like your stereotypical 'psychedelic' image however I have never seen shapes move that way before, even in film or with special effects. I felt as though I was on a train or some form of transport moving through dimensions or moving somewhere, but I was definitely travelling.

After doing this for a while (I have no idea how long, could have been 5 seconds or 5 minutes) I decide I need to breath. Bare in mind I had taken an ecstasy tablet  earlier, had a few drinks and also smoked some weed. When I breathed it felt like I was being disconnected from something, I can only describe it like the chairs in the matrix that they have, the release of suction noise when leaving the matrix is the same sound I experienced and felt when I breathed.

I felt a sense of reassurance, someone was telling me not to worry, that I was breathing fine and that I was overthinking, but the thought of not breathing, coupled with the fact I had no concept of how long I had been holding my breath 9 (if at all) freaked me out so I breathed again.

 This time I had the same disconnection feeling however this time instead of being reassured, I became aware of some confusion around me, I began to move away from the spiral and was looking directly at a bright light. Around the light I could make out shapes, they were moving and I could tell they were wondering why I wasn't either taking their advice not to breath or not following normal procedures. When I think back on this I am not sure if the additional drugs I had taken caused the confusion with whatever seemed to be studying me. Make no mistake though, I was not out of it. I was very conscious. In fact, once I entered the initial spiral it seemed to sober me up.

I breathed again. This time I noticed a more rushed confusion from the shapes I could see above me. I was being studied I felt. They weren't sure why my brain was reacting in the way it was. 

Again I felt the reassurance. It was telling me to trust, that worst case scenario my friends were outside the door and would be able to resuscitate me were I to faint or pass out but all the will trying to calm me by saying that I was breathing. There was also something telling me that where I was currently, I did not need to breath. 

I don't know if it was my body or mind that kept breathing, even though they were reassuring me, I felt that I had to breath, I felt them studying me further. I felt them say (bare in mind this reassurance and everything being said to me is coming from my own inner voice) that it was because our species was not advanced or that there was something wrong with me not following the instructions. It was at this stage that I became aware that they felt whatever else I had takem was interrupting whatever they were trying to do.

Each time I breathed after this I became aware of these moving shapes above me (which I could only see long oval shapes moving around me like typical grey aliens only I could not make out any distinct features, just an outline and the light in the middle. I became aware that as I was on this trip they only had a certain amount of time to study me as the effects were wearing off each time.

Everytime I breathed I felt like they had to go back to the start of whatever they were doing, until it became very rushed and I started to breath more frequently, and then they stopped studying me.

They were done I could tell, whether they got what they needed I have no idea however I could tell that the trip I was on was no longer strong enough for them to do whatever they wanted to do. I began to go back into the spiral, only this time, instead of moving forward very quickly (like light speed) I was moving backwards. I was on my way back to earth, to the room and bed I was lying in. It was then I began to ask questions.

Now I have thought a lot about this, about whether it was the DMT alone, whether it was the other drugs, whether it was my mind trying to make sense of what was happening to me by coming to seemingly the only obvious conclusion, aliens, to be honest I do not know. All I will say is that I was fully conscious and can remember this whole experience vividly.

I began to ask who they were, they answered in my voice, in my head 'you already know' now again this is something that is crazy, they seemed to pluck the answers from my brain, it was like someone training an apprentice by not giving them the answer but making them think. 'I did already know' about some of the answers. I have to admit I was open to the idea of aliens and had seen Prometheus so whether my brain knew some of the answers to my questions  I don't know.

I immediately accepted they were aliens (again was this my brain trying to reaffirm something I believed in as an attempt to make sense of this?) and began to ask why they weren't revealing themselves. They said 'you already know' and I began thinking of religion and how many people around the world are killing themselves over stupid shit. It made sense.

I asked what this experience was and was told 'you already know' I have to admit not being told the words 'you already know' it was more of a spiritual 'search your mind and you will find the answers' kind of thing, but I did feel as though they were still there, using their telepathy to answer my questions in a way that I could comprehend.

Here's where it gets a little cray cray (if it hasn't already) I began to ask if they would ever reveal themselves and ask could they help end the suffering on earth. I was told or made to believe that they needed people to dedicate their lives to convincing others that we are not alone, they wanted me to do this for them. Again (sorry to keep saying again it's just all convoluted) with me being open to the idea of aliens I don't know if my brain was making all of this up or whether, as they told me, that because I was open to the idea of aliens and would not let this revelation affect my life, this was the reason I was having my questions answered. They made me aware that not everyone gets to ask questions as some people would be dramatically affected by such an experience and I knew I would not.

I began to think of all the things I wanted to do in life but they were trying to convince me that 'none of this matters' it was as though they were saying everything you want to do in life is completely minuscule in comparison to what is out there, what they want me to do and what I am aiming to do instead of this task. They wanted me to devote my life to convince others of extra terrestrial existence. They wanted me to calm people and introduce the idea in ways that would not cause fear, but understanding. They were sounding disappointed that I had these 'selfish' ambitions that were meaningless to them. I made them aware that they weren't meaningless to me, that they were important. They seemed to accept that. They made a deal with me that if I achieve everything I want to by 40 that I shall help them do what they asked. I agreed. I am 26 now so either I am going to be the alien representative in 14 years or my brain was trying to make sense of a psychedelic trip by giving me the proof of aliens that I seemingly wanted.

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? How does this sound?

A final note would be to say that neither my friend or his cousing experienced anything like this. They both took the same stuff in the same environment, but just described generic trippy stuff like the spiral without anything else. They just saw some colours essentially.

 I would do this again, although I am honestly afraid of what might happen. I really am. There are things that we do not and cannot yet understand, but the possibility that DMT unlocks our minds and allows us to travel inter-planetary or inter-dimensional is definitely a possibility. Either that or I am a crazy mofo who needs locked up. ",1

"I just had the most amazing experience of my entire life X 1,000,000
Oh my lord. I feel so so honored right now. I have only smoked DMT from ACRB from psychedseeds so far, and I have had incredible experiences. I have encountered all sorts of strange entities and seen things that I didn't think were possible. But, the DMT is different from what I just smoked off of a new batch of bark from a different vendor. 

When I smoked DMT before, I never really got any body sensations or felt much as far as emotion, just amazement at the alien dimensions I was witnessing. Maybe it has to do with the music/my mindset, I don't know. But today I smoked the new stuff and literally had the most beautiful experience of my entire life. BY FAR! I put on Gaia by Blackmill (highly recommend)! I smoked probably 25mg through my gvg. Immediately I was in this beautiful dimension when I closed my eyes, much different than anything I have ever been in. There was an entity. No. An angel..  She was so beautiful and absolutely poured her eternal love into me..... It is so strange saying this being an adamant atheist my entire life. She looked like a complex wine glass almost? Made of layers of cupped glass sort of. And as the song progress, she poured the sound and pure love into them, and the music radiated and shifted all around me. This went on as I began to tear up with the sheer beauty. Then, at the end, she poured love straight into my body and I felt the sensation that many feel as being incredibly warm and beautiful, almost like an entire bodily orgasm..  I came out of it and have been crying very hard for about the past 45 minutes. I just can't believe what just happened to me.

Now I feel that I must change. This DMT trip has affected me more than all of the others combined. I feel that I need to spread as much love as possible and devote my entire life to this substance. And I'm going to. I have already introduced it to a couple people, and I am going to do it as much as possible. I believe psychedelics, especially DMT can and will change the world. Sounds corny but I hope to look to a better future. Thanks for reading friends",1

What a terrifyingly beautiful experience I just had.
But now that its over, I've never felt so free, I can't wait to begin my life again... I was an addict, my priorities were fucked, and I spent all my money on escaping this reality, I lost my job and even a few friends because of it, but no more. I'm breaking this cycle. I want to participate in life, not sit on the sidelines, high as hell, watching others and wishing I could join in. 
I am so grateful for this experience, even though it absolutely ripped my soul apart, I think put me back together in the right sequence this time.

Edit: I wrote, then accidentally deleted a trip report in the comments, so here's a short version of it, for the curious:

I'm in my room, after meditating and clearing all expectations, I take 3 hits off my vape, break through (after a voice told me to let go, I stopped fighting this 'death'), and end up in a huge white room with projections on it. I sense 2 entities, they're very ominous, but one is truly terrifying. I ask what they want, and what they have to show me. They immediately send me into several different bodies, I live these other lives from birh to death, and they seem very familiar. I live several at a time, but there were so many it feels like 300 years. I get the sense these were past lives, and explained why I am the person I am today. It showed me the darkest aspects of myself and how to begin to resolve my issues in this reality. 

It began very very dark, I experienced the worst pain of my life, but then I went through the entire range of emotion, and came down feeling the most intense love, just pure bliss. I felt like I had seen the void and made it back with a new lease on life. It was the most intense experience I've ever had.",4

Did 20mg in my bed, found myself in a room with yellow geometric shapes all around, some kind of entity above me probing and investigating my brain. Flipped over, felt the whole experience shift, immediately thought, ""okay, this is all manipulatable, it's a drug, alter your input stimulus.

Neat, cool little journey.

As I was coming out of it, I got the urge to see if another hit would take.me back. Big.mistake.

I loaded up.my pen with what looked like 30mg, just slightly more than the measured 20 from before.

Pulse. Pulse. ""Here's to science!"" Rip.

I don't remember exhaling, but the onset was immediate. Devils, demons, all kinds of scary stuff pounding me from every direction. I did it, eternity collapsed in on itself and I'm stuck in a place with no exit, all meaning and structure of reality ripped away.

There is no boundary between me, the bed, the room next door, my sleeping wife therein. None of it has meaning, it's all gone, I finally went too far. We're all mixed up together in one jumbled confused something...what? A brain? Was she ever even real at all, was there anything even to be real or I'd this just all there ever was?  She's going to find me.like this, all crazed, no sensory perception with the outside world, catatonic forever, requirin lg constant care. Eternity happening over and over in an instant of permanent geometric detachment and shapes forever pounding my consciousness.

Then, slowly, my body began to come back into my awareness. The feeling like being beat down but in a therapeutic way began to arise. I felt a glimmer of hope that perhaps I'd be with my wife again and that we might be able to interact in our bodies and have a life still. Yes, this is a room, and there's a wall, ah of course, my wife is a person and she's fine and unaffected. The district separation of ideas and concepts began to reform.

Gratitude. What we have is so special and rare, it rides upon the edge of a knife. Small choices can make huge differences in the outcome of our lives. I felt so much gratitude that it was over and that I was coming out of it. I made it back.

By the time I could get up to walk around, I was wrecked. This stuff is not to be trifled with, this experience showed me this. I need to lay off the weed, be more present and focused on the moment, my relationships, and keepiny brain and body in good health. Stewardship of myself makes me a capable instrument to bring peace and love into the world.

It was maybe an hour past the peak of a very nice 240ug acid trip at the creek with two friends, and I decide to do dmt.
I've done this combo once before a year ago, and let's just say on that trip I was infused with ancient knowledge and briefly thought I was a horse.

I manage to take all 3 required hits using the sandwich method in a bong before I really realize what's happening.
I exhale the third hit.

BOOM it was like a neural nuke went off in my head. ""holy shit!"". The bong I was holding turned into 4 bongs so I put it down ASAP. 

The visuals at the creek accelerate so exponentially, to the point where moving my eyes makes everything ripple instantly like a tsunami. 

I can see every detail of every object in my visual field without having to look at it, with insane resolution. Everything was so accelerated, it felt like I was moving through years within seconds. The experience overwhelmingly defined what 'real' is, while my ordinary life was reduced to nothing but an illusion. 

However the most surprising part of this was how fast I moved. My arms were lightning fast from my perspective,  I moved with an autonomy that proved to me that there was no 'me' making the decision to move. A bug flew by my ear and I dispatched it within a tenth of a second, and then immediately stood up. I could not take any ownership of the intelligence I had seemed to tap into. However, my friends could not give an accurate report of what I looked like from the outside. (anyone else have experience with full motor function autonomy?) 

The comedown back to LSD was bliss, and I knew I had seen something I'll never forget or fully integrate back into life. If you want to get as high as humanly possible, LSDMT. There's no way to expect it or to be truly ready for it, but it's like connecting to the total energy and intelligence of the entire universe. ",1

"You know what I love the most about DMT?
Whether you believe it is real or ""In the mind"" the reality is NO ONE bloody knows and this substance just adds to the mystery of reality and makes you realize how ignorant as fuck the human race really is. I'd bet my money on ignorance than pretend our primitive species has ANY FUCKING IDEA WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON- Peace.",0
"Can anyone relate to this feeling?
Whenever I take DMT riiight as it kicks in and starts to shift me over 'there', it's like I have this sudden clarity about how everything I have done has led to me taking DMT. Me doing this is the only thing that could have happened and this is exactly what was supposed to have happened. It's like all of time folds in on itself to that point... I can almost describe it like each DMT is some sort of checkpoint back to the really real reality. ",1

"60mg Trip Report (Jesus Christ)
I feel like I need to share what just happened. I have had about 40+ breakthroughs up to this point, most of them seem very similar. This one I just had was completely different. I'm not a religious person I do believe in a universal power that transcends my understanding that I choose to call God. I heated my Quartz banger for 45 sec then let cool for 15. I had a 60mg dose weighed out on a piece of foil that I dropped in. I hit me like a ton of bricks and then I was there on the other side. Usually I see entities manifesting geometric gadgets with different spectrums of color in them. This time they showed what I can only sum up as Jesus and him showing people the way. I never really believed he existed. I thought maybe there was a chance. This breakthrough they showed me his story and why it had to happen. I lost about 90% of what I was shown but I didn't forget who they showed me and how powerful this was. When I came back I spent a good 30 minutes balling my eyes out. ",1
"DMT + weed = most intense psychedelic trip of my life
 I was at my friends house and i inhaled this yellow DMT containing NMT and other alkaloids which give you this pleasant stoned like short lasting body high. As usual i had some dreamy CEV's and sort of have seen the tunnel. But it was nothing special.

 Then and we got totally stoned from weed. I was so stoned that i have felt my short term memory erasing after each sentence i said. Somehow I have decided now is the time for my DMT trip, i have eyeballed some DMT powder using the knife and started vaporizing it with lighter using  plastic Coke bottle cut and wrapped tinfoil at the bottom. 

This time i have really paid attention by looking at the liquid turned dark DMT speck until it fully was vaporized and the plastic bottle was full of DMT fog, i have ripped two large volumes of this chockingly unpleasant substance vapor into my lungs, but because of weed's calming effect i was able to not cough and hold it far longer than usual. 

Then I suddenly had this felling something unimaginably big and great is approaching, i felt little dizzy but was seeing everything crystal clear, i have started feeling this overwhelming vibration in my whole body. First thing i noticed was the sound of the fridge becoming ever louder and wider until i have felt emotions i have newer felt before and not even knew existed, i have started seeing very lucid OEV's, physical objects in the room were morphing in and out of existence and have felt as a totally different person as if i was living the life in alternate universe, but with the same body. 

At some point i could not anymore discern between what i was seeing or dreaming, but i have managed to lie down on the couch to relax and then at some point of living like series of thousand lives or dreams, i finally had this overview of billion of lives playing all at once like some youtube videos in this void where i was not a person but existence itself. 

Not sure how long i was like this but at some point my awareness of the real physical world started returning and i have felt this overwhelming sensation of astonishment as i was still trying to comprehend what i saw. I was still being carried away into the dream world but after like 10 minutes i was finally able to concentrate and communicate with my friend more efficiently and tell him what i saw, well least a fraction of it. 

Although i was experienced with psychedelics, this was the trip of my life and now i really understand the meaning of the word ""trip"". I have found what i was looking for all the time and i think all the people unconsciously are seeking their entire lives...",1

"I remember most of during my DMT trips, here's my attempt to explain what happens
A lot of people in this sub claim that they just can't remember most of their trip or that it's unable to be put into linguistics. For the most part, you CAN'T remember all of it, but I can definitely begin to put it into words... 

I'll put this in ""tiers"", I won't put dosages because DMT dosage depends on: past experience, personal body chemistry, purity of product, method of inhalation. 


**Tier 1: Threshold/Light**

The overall vibe of the room changes and it feels as though all the objects in the room are somehow, in an unknown way, are connected more than we (humans) know. Everything begins to look fuzzy as if water were splashed in my face. My voice in my head becomes super loud and ""important"" and then everything I think becomes important. This feels very similar to... NOTHING. LSD? Shrooms? No, nothing else has this same combination of emotional, physical, and mental effects. It almost feels like you did not even take a drug and you just lost your tiredness. *Not every DMT trip is the same, even at the same dosages. Sometimes I can get visuals at this stage, othertimes it will be self reflective and emotional*.


**Tier 2: Mild**

All of Tier 1, but exponentially stronger. Within seconds, no matter how I felt before, it is ALL replaced with the feeling of when you walk into an unknown area. I feel ""exposed"", in a sense that some alien presence is nearby and is becoming more aware of me, and vice versa. I begin to hear imaginary drums and ancient chanting. This can scare the hell out of most people. Pareidolia becomes extreme, as everything I look at begins to look like faces, patterns, fractals, or religious figures. They feel like the most familiar thing you can think of and the most alien thing you can think of, at the same time, which causes a mindfuck. Closed Eye Visuals began to come to life. I begin to get that feeling you get when you wake up from a vivid dream, how you're ""back to reality"". However, the ""vivid dream"" in this case is reality, and what I'm going back to is the DMT world. Anything I think of at this point heavily influences the visuals. For example, thinking ""insectoid"" caused my room to become greenish and menacing as if the patterns I was seeing were ready to jump out and attack me. And thinking ""love"" would cause the patterns to look magical and playful.

**Tier 3: Strong**

I now feel as though I am rocketing out of my body at high speeds and that my body is slowly not existing. The visuals aren't only seen, they are felt and heard. Everything I look it is now overlapped with extremely complex patterns, while simultaneously shooting off afterimages in every direction, while streaming like a river. As all of this is happening, my focus shifts to random colors and they strangely cause me to think of more complex patterns. So pretty much... an overdose of adobe after effects. Everything begins to ALSO, look 3D and then 4D on the surface, EXACTLY how physicists explain 5D, but it's impossible to visualize while not under the influence. *I have counted about 11 visual effects that go on all at once:* Color Shifting/Incorrect color interpretation, Afterimages, River Flowing, Size Warping, Pareidolia manifested on everything, Shimmering Lights, Perfect Symmetry at random points, 4D Texture, movie-like scenes going on inside head, geometric patterns in head, and ""ocean waves"" of energy directly dropped seemingly in ""between your eyes and the external world"".

Many can get scared in this stage as well. These rapid shifts in perception are causing the sensation of breaking through to come closer and closer... which leads to numb limbs and increased heart rate. This is completely normal and very short-lasting. (Do not focus on physical sensations on DMT)

**Visual Example**: 

I saw a girl who was standing in space who did not have a jaw, instead she had a bathroom-sink where the lower part of her head would be. She kept laughing. It didnt ""look"", in a visual sense, that she was laughing. However, the way that the patterns shifted around lightning-fast caused the sensation that she was laughing. Her laugh sounded like a mixture of an animal sound, a SNES-era game, and an angelic voice. She appeared for about 20 seconds but it felt like a real entity that I already knew.

**Tier 4: Breakthrough**

As I breakthrough, my whole perception is now filled with similar entities such as bathroom-sink mouth girl. Each of them just as wild and random, full of life with their own histories, personalities, feelings, and intentions. We all feel interconnected as if we can all read each other's energy. These entities are NOT always good (just like humans) and can range from: nice, friendly, entertaining, waiting for you to entertain them, rude, jerkish, dark, demanding - pretty much any personality trait. During a breakthrough, visuals are changing so fucking fast that it's no way to ""write a full trip report"". So, here's a 5 second snippet....

A disappointed looking guy who was colored 100% bronze like a statue fell down on his knees and then a ball of 100 or so lions appeared on his back. The lions were balled up, just how fish are in a net. They had beautiful colors, shades of purple that didn't even look real. He looked at me and they all dissapated into a bunch of starry lights that swirled together forming complex snowflakes. These snowflakes smashed together and exploded and the explosion shot out particles that expanded into a scene with a bunch of girls with bags on their heads were running around punching cars and slashing tires. Yes, all of this was in 5 seconds, so imagine someone trying to explain their whole trip... The audio sounds during a breakthrough are pretty accurate to what I've heard on youtube replicas. However, while under the influence, they will feel different, and originate from inside your head even in complete silence.

**Tier 5: Blackout** 

Adding more DMT at this point makes the patterns change more rapidly, and increases all the other effects, making it gradually much more hard to remember. MORE is not ALWAYS better, sorry.

**Caution!**

For some it is a spiritual journey, for others it is just a drug to see crazy shit. *Different strokes for different folks.* Regardless of your reason for doing DMT, the most important thing is that you be SAFE and know what you are getting into!

I hope that this post helps you get a better understanding of DMT. I have learned how to enter the headspace with the intention of paying attention to whatever happens. If you'd like to know more about anything I wrote, feel free to ask.",1

"DMT on 500ug LSD
Took 5 tabs of GammaGoblin’s voidrealm tabs and decided to smoke some DMT after the peak. I usually smoke DMT in complete silence but I decided to try it with some music, also I usually close my eyes but wanted to see what would happen with my eyes open, or if I could even keep them open for that matter. 

I’m a big Phish phan and was playing an incredible ‘98 Harry Hood (for those familiar). It’s a very bouncy and playful, and complex song. 

Anyways. I start taking hits of my DMT. By the second hit the walls and everything start bending, edges sharpen, textures turn to a shiny glass, vision starts to vibrate. Then on the third hit I hear a voice say “going all the way, eh?” It was somewhat of a struggle to keep my eyes open but I couldn’t ignore or even fathom what was happening in my room. A tall, elf-like figure appeared in the corner and began to conjure these gigantic, colorful balls, they reminded me of billiard balls. He/she was bouncing and kicking them around the room to the tempo of the song. It eventually became too hard to keep my eyes open and I was confronted with a serpent-goddess, bending and stretching in impossible ways. 10/10 experience would recommend. 

Also, I’ve heard of people claiming you can control electronic devices on DMT, mainly speakers. Owsley Stanley, the Grateful Dead’s LSD chemist, claimed they would have at least 1 person smoke DMT at a show to make the speakers louder at certain moments, he claims sometimes the tubes would even burn out because of this. While I was holding in my third hit, it sounded like my speaker was skipping and the music seemed a little off, then as I started breathing again, the music was back to normal and more beautiful than ever. Very interesting.
