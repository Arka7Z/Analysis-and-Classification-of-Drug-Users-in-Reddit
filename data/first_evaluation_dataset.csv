21 days. $600+ saved. I didn't realize I had worked up to a 10 grand a year habit. I can already notice small differences that make me happy. My skin is clearing up a lot. I'm relearning how to be a human being. The bags under my eyes are getting lighter. I look healthier. I've put on a good amount of weight because I'm actually eating right now. Feels good. Lots of pain but I don't even want dope anymore. Today has been a very very tough day for me but I'm still going strong.,Recovering
"I sit back. Fractals flood my field of vision. Colors move within each other. Blackness starts seeping in. I set the nail down in front of me, this was my last own thought. Visions. Everything I have ever experienced is before me. I see myself. But not as myself. I am looking at John from the perspective of someone else. Everyone else. I quickly learn about who John is. I see a man who has been through hell. I see a man who needs to be accepted but doesn’t accept it when he is. I see a man who is deeply in love. I see every time he felt compassion towards another. I see every time he has let someone down. I see that he has disappointed many people. And I see that it weighs on him. I see his death. I watch as he experiences his last thoughts. Then nothing. He isn’t dead. He experienced the moments before death. He knows that his last thought would have been how much of a disappointment he is. I see him fail. He has switched majors, he is hopeless for the future, he has turned to drugs to fix his problems. This decision weighs on his girlfriend. I see how his relationship ends. I don’t want this for him. I try warning him. I yell at him to stop doing drugs. I show him what I saw. I show him every time he has loved her, felt love towards her, and I showed him how he was in the beginning of their relationship. I now show himself to him. He is sprawled on his floor, hair awry, hands furiously flailing against his chest, clutching his shirt. I show him his absent stare. I show him his girlfriend sitting between two people without faces. She is disappointed. She is scared. But most of all, she is there. She is there. The picture of her concerned face melts away and he sees more fractals. I take John into my arms and ask him “Now what?” He has classes tomorrow, he has a speech to finish writing and present tomorrow, he has a doctor’s appointment the next day, he has an ounce of weed coming in the mail, he has rent next month. He has no clue how to handle his current situation. He is severely depressed. He asks me who I am. I am nobody. I ask him “Now what?” He doesn’t answer. I show him a future. In it he is happy. He is married to his girlfriend, he is sober, he has three children, he has a successful job. I show him another future. He is alone. In a dark house that does not belong to him. He has nobody who loves him anymore. I show him everyone he hurt, I show him what he did to push everyone away. I show him how he dies from an overdose. Alone. I pull the images away. I need not ask him what he has to do. He knows. I know he knows because I am him and he is me. Everything folds. Our knowledge and understanding combines. Confusion. Lights. Loud racket. Panic. “Can… can you turn the music off.” I see concern sweep across faces in the room. Smoke fills my lungs, I panic. “I have to get out of here” I puke in my girlfriend’s toilet. I am afraid to die. I have not accomplished the things I need to. I must make up for what I’ve done. EDIT: This is my first trip report posted on reddit. any feedback would be appreciated greatly. thank you EDIT 2: Thank you all so much. I didn't think it would blow up like this. I love every one of you all. I am still recovering from the trip, and I am still working to fix things. I poured my heart into this and it makes me really really happy to get positive feedback.",Recovering
"So I was catching up with psychedsubstance earlier and got the idea that smoking DMT would be a fun time tonight. Now, a few important notes of background, I'm taking a low dose of the antidepressant venlafaxine, so I didn't know how much the deems would affect me. I had also done a lot of MDMA the night before, which sorta worked in weird ways, and I had smoked two fat bowls of weed earlier in the day. Anyway I totally eyeball a dose, at a guess it was maybe around 60mg, and take one huge toke which I hold in for as long as possible. I blow out the window of my bedroom but apparently this isn't good enough because the smell stinks out our entire house. I'm definitely feeling it, I go and lie down on a soft bed and fold inwards experiencing lots of wonky dimensions and flashing psychedelic colours morphing into pulsating fractals. It is only a few minutes into the experience when my dad comes into my room asking about the smell. I sorta just look at him and shakily murmur a few words, not quite sure what I said. I'm seeing his face rippling with ever changing iridescent colours. I flop down and cuddle up to him for a bit, which he thinks is pretty weird but goes along with it, and then he leaves. A few more minutes pass and then both my mum and my dad come in asking about the smell. I just look up at them and tell them plain and simple that I'm smoking DMT, it's an incredibly powerful hallucinogen, and I didn't mean to stink the house out. They both ask if I feel alright, I say yeah I'm fine, and then I tell them what the experience is like. I even ask if either of them want to do it, my mum looks quite tempted but in the end they pass and leave me to it. They honestly were fine with it, they thought it was quite a funny situation, and said that as long as I was safe it was all cool. Maybe just go in the garden next time though. I ride the rest of the trip out becoming one with the blankets and mattresses. I even go back to finish off the bowl and lightly trip a bit more. Then I guess I went on reddit to rake in upvotes lol",Addicted
"Yes this isn't a standard r/drugs post but I've been on this sub for a year now and seen a fair amount of posts about kids getting caught with drugs by their parents I just read a post about a person who's dad is a cop and caught them with weed so now their dad doesn't know what to do and says he will enforce police dogs to make sure there child is out of trouble. You gotta realize that your parents have seen a lot more than you have in their days, my dad is very anti drugs and hates me smoking weed. But thats because he grew up and saw alot of his friends go down dark roads of hard addiction so he doesn't want me to do that because he cares about me. I may be mad at him but I realize it's out of the good of his heart. Y'all need to see that too, if your mad at ur parents try to see it from their perspective. Your parents care and love you guys don't give up on them, trust me no drug is worth more than family, because family will always be one phone call away when u need it no matter where u are in life. Edit: Oh man I just checked this for the first time today and thanks alot guys for my first gold, really brightened my night. Your parents love u guys and those in hard family situations just hang in there hopefully something good will turn up.",Addicted
"I'm an avid chess player when sober, but playing on different substances is one of my favorite things to do. I don't know if anyone on r/drugs plays chess or even cares about this, but here I'm posting my experience playing while drunk, tripping, tweaking, or high. ***** **Sober (Baseline)** I play 10 | 0, classical, on lichess.org... Normal stuff. I usually try to close the position and break the opponent through positional play. *Sober game:* https://en.lichess.org/VD3ZBkyw (I'm white) **Alchohol (tipsy)** Moves feel more natural, I can move without thinking too much but I still play accurately. I blast trance on the headphones and play 3 | 0 blitz, winning most games! In some respects, I feel that I play better when buzzed. *Drunk game:* https://en.lichess.org/g0pbpeCQ (I'm black) **Alchohol (smashed)** I do not give a single fuck when I move. I am wayyy too aggressive. I just do a tidal wave of pawns and exchange material whenever theres a chance. I pretty much lose 90% of my games when I'm super drunk. **Adderall** Hole. Eee. Shit. I turn in to a motherfucking chess computer on adderall. I can deeply analyze positions without sacrificing too much time. 10 | 0 on adderall and I win almost every game, playing at an 1800 level on chess.com. This is seriously a performance enhancing drug for chess. **LSD (150 μg)** *Did I change my board theme to rainbow hexagons? Why does my music sound like its coming out of my head, not my headphones? Oh, I'm playing chess! Yes, what a lovely game. A battle between two minds, there's truly nothing like it.* I notice that I am *very* good at spotting tactics playing on LSD. This is when you temporarily sacrifice material for a lethal attack, or a long term advantage in the game. Looking back on my games from LSD trips, I'm amazed at how innovatively I play. I make moves that sober me wouldn't never even consider... Overall, acid makes me a much more creative player. I play with aggression and vigor, creating threats with every move. LSD + Chess = amazing! **Salvia** No **Shrooms (Golden teachers, 3g)** *A human. There is a human I am playing against across the internet. It feels that our minds are linked over such a vast expanse of space and time. Oh, right, I need to move.* I'm sorry, but I play like a retard on shrooms. Maybe it's the way psylocibin effects the brain, but I blunder every 5 moves. An interesting thing I noticed, however, is that I'm much more compassionate when playing on mushrooms. I congratulate my opponent on their win, and am impressed by their cleverness. But overall, LSD is the superior psychedelic for chess. EDIT: *u/rory_spencer gave an amazing account of his experience with chess on shrooms in a reply to this thread. I've included an excerpt, but you can see the whole post by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/65lybk/chess_on_drugs/dgbvpxh/)!* > Staring down at the tan and black coloured board I observed a desert, the dwindling number of pieces looked as dramatic as a standoff between great mountains, with cactuses and lizards squatting on boulders. The games that followed were suitably hallucinatory, I felt I was witnessing every possible permutation of warfare and conflict all on that board, clashing lines of muddy footsoldiers brawling in the dirt, tense Mexican standoffs, mages teasing one another from afar. All in glorious technicolour imax 3d. **Marijuana** On weed, I play as I do when I'm sober, but I calculate positions much more slowly. I notice that I play a lot more conservatively, making sure that my defense is solid before making any attacking maneuvers. Overall, I play quite well when high. **DXM** I'm trying this tonight, it's my first time tripping on DXM and I'll be doing 300mg! Leave a comment to predict how you think I will play. I'll be sure to post links to my games tomorrow. Hi r/drugs, I am on drug right now, I am on DXM. My legs feel switched and I can't walk and everything FUCKED. But holy fuck can I play chess, I think this game is buried inside my bones. I can play because I am chess. https://en.lichess.org/vaLvDtGZ/ https://en.lichess.org/0IiE4jrk/white <-- Computer chess engine says im almost perfect? ***** Unfortunately I didn't save all the links to my games under the influence of these different substances, but I'll be sure to update the thread with links later if anyone is interested. I hope that this thread was an enjoyable read. Thanks for taking a look :-) **EDIT:** I did not expect to wake up to this post blowing up. Thank you, each and every one of you, for taking an interest in my weird hobby and taking the time to read my personal accounts. I am flattered by the community's interest and even more so by your kind, amazing comments. Thank you r/drugs. You guys are beautiful. Have an awesome Easter!",Addicted
"One of the key things to remember when doing drugs is that you have to be able to walk away from doing those drugs, even if it’s just smoking weed. If you can’t take a break from doing/using, then you aren’t doing drugs, you’re addicted to them. Sometimes you gotta take a break to remind yourself that it’s a choice, and remind yourself why you’re making that choice. Drugs are for making good moments even better, not for making bad moments bearable. You have to feel the lows to enjoy the highs. You have to recognize that sobriety isn’t something to escape, bc if you spend your life trying to avoid sobriety then you aren’t allowing yourself to enjoy life at its essence.",Recovered
"Lately I've been splurging on crack/cocaine. I've spent nearly 1000 or more just these past two months. I don't know how, but I always end up going back to it. Especially since it's so easy to get in my neighborhood. Now I'm broke, jobless, no car, and just don't know what to do... so I broke my glass pipe on purpose.

"He couldn't hold back a laugh when I explained to him that I had gone off my prozac(under my family doctors supervision) at the beginning of the summer because I go to music festivals and take MDMA throughout the summer. He thought it was hilarious that I was aware enough to understand I shouldn't do them both, but that I had chosen to go off my medication so that I could use M in the first place. No real point to this story, I am back on medication now that the summer is over, but I think it was hilarious that he couldn't stifle his laugh. I should be clear, my psychiatrist and I have a fairly good relationship, and he wasn't laughing to be an asshole, he just found the situation to be funny.",Addicted

Altho my dealers arnt to happy and keep hassling me, annoyed with the loss of a valuable customer ( I was going through a hell of a lot) telling me they've got better gear now and they'll do me exclusive deals and free samples. basically waving this shit in my face saying""you know you want it"" and im having a really hard time saying no I dunno what to do.

"That was three days ago. He was 27, I was the Last person who saw him, I was in the house with him that night, parents had gone to dinner out. I too was on k but inside with music. I didn't realize what had happened when I didn't see him in the garden, I thought it weird, but figured he had gone out. Mother came and I told her that, we went to sleep. I woke to the sounds of my mother when she saw him next morning. I'm fucking broken, it's still Hard to believe. Keep wondering all the things I could've done and crying when I think of him. I was mad at myself, now I just alternate between sadness, regrets and overwhelming sadness. I miss my brother so fucking much, guys.

"Pls no hate for the title, but I was diagnosed as autistic 5 years ago. I would engage in repetitive actions for hours at a time, did not know how to engage socially, had no idea why people did the things they did. A year ago I started taking shrooms every weekend starting at 2 grams, then 1uickly increasing up to 6 to 10, depending on how I felt. Because of this dedication to every weekend, I sometimes had bad trips due to bad set and setting, and life getting me down. I think that the ""autistic"" need to follow a routine forced me to continue, and I'm glad it did. During these trips I began to understand why people did things, I realised how social interactions worked and what I should do when people did certain things. I think that the bad trips I had were by far the most helpful, despite how horrible they were; replaying every social fuckup I've ever made, for 6 hours in my head, analysing their thoughts and emotions, seeing their body language, and playing different scenarios through helped me find ways in real life to approach situations As time went by I slowly grew more and more social, and more understanding of social circles, and well... less autistic It's like my brain had swallowed all the information I needed to be a ""normal"" human being and hidden it at the back, and taking shrooms regularly formed pathways in my mind that allowed me to access these corners, and in doing so, shrug off the weight of autism, or at least suppress it from every person I met knowing immediately, to now some of my closest friends being shocked when they found out I just thought I'd share with you guys, and maybe inspire a few others to try this out, it's been life changing for me and I'm so happy I did it, and want to help others live a more normal life",Addicted

"I’m writing this because I honestly just have to share this with other people because it is fucking ridiculous. So I’m 19 and I have been best friends with my one friend Kyle since we were 10. Kyle and I are both in college and we both live with our parents. We both smoke a lot now and I honestly can’t tell you the last time I was with him and we didn’t smoked because he ALWAYS insists that we HAVE to. So i know ppl get the munchies and shit, but let me tell you of how absurd and obnoxious Kyle is about food and stuff when we smoke. So one time we got to a movie late becuz Kyle said we had to smoke before so when we finally get into the movie high af and sit down, he asks if im gonna get anything to eat and drink and I said no. I swear he almost had a fit becuz like every other time we smoke he tells me he “HAS to eat.” He asks if I were to buy a large popcorn then he’ll buy a large Coke. Since Im a nice friend I agreed, but then he fuckin hands me his money and asks me to go buy all of it by myself while he watches the movie becuz he “doesn’t feel like getting up” I was fuckin pissed but trying to enjoy my high as usual so I just did it. You’d think I’d get some of the popcorn right? Nope, I think I got a few pieces until he took it and put it on his lap and began scarffing down absolute handfulls like he lived in a 3rd world country with popcorn falling all of the place becuz he was eating it too fast. Finally the fuckin crunching noise from him eating popcorn stopped, but only becuz he finished off the entire fuckin thing. Finally the movie ends and it’s almost midnight. Of course like every other time, we had to smoke again and get more food before going back to my house. As soon as we got back to my house high af again, He busts open his 3 taco bell locos tacos and eats them before I can even find something to put on netflix. Dont worry becuz like 45 mins later he pulls put his wax pen and we get even higher. Then of course he goes “Yo do you got any snacks.” (Keep in mind kyles only like 5 foot 9, 160 not fat) One word that I have come to hate with passion just becuz of Kyle is the word “snacks” becuz that is the only way he refers to food when were high and he always says it. I tell him yeah becuz I just want to enjoy my high and stuff even tho it annoys me so much. He asks me if I have popcorn and as soon as I tell him yes I swear he almost nutted in his pants. I shit you not this is what he did. When I said yes he goes “ohhh god yesssssirrrr” and starts fuckin air humping with his arms in my kitchen sayin “Hell yeahhh, baby hell yeahhh” I didn’t say anything and went back into my room. I got some popcorn this time, but no much as he literally mowed down the whole bowl. I go to make a sandwich becuz I literally didn’t eat anything and Kyle comes out to the kitchen and goes “yo do you got pb and jelly” I say yeah and he tells me “ you know what sounds so bomb, a quadruple decker pb&j sandwich” I was so fuckin pissed at this point as he took the rest of our families bread to make it. After that, this motherfucker grabs 2 boxes of cheese-its and box of cap n crunch. He was literally just eating the cereal like popcorn until he finished what was left of MY FAMILIES box of cereal. Finally its 3 in the morning and hes falling asleep (we literally don’t even hang out sometimes when we smoke, sometimes its just him and his food and his phone) so I turn the lights off and then I shit you fuckin not he says “can we make a pizza?” I was like wtf no youre falling asleep and its 3. He says “Can we call dominos for a pick up?” At this point im pissed and he says “that sounds bomb right now” and i say no again then he says “fine i guess we can wake and bake and get some tomorrow” I then wake up at like 7 in the morning to kyle literally throwing up in my bathroom 100% becuz he ate too much and hes done that before too. I then always have to vacuum my room everytime hes over becuz he leaves popcorn and crumbs all over my floor when hes over. So this is just one story of many that really highlights how obnoxious my friend can be when high. Hes super cool and funny to hang out with when hes sober but holy fuck hes a different person when high. I just had to share that shit. Lemme know if you possibly have had a similar experience and lemme know if you wanna hear other stories hahaha",Addicted

"Hey guys, sorry for another classic bartard story. I never thought it would be me, but here we are. It all started like any normal night, I was playing PUBG on skype with some friends, and I had gotten some bars a few hours earlier from my friend. I popped one, only ever smoked weed before, and I didn't feel anything so I popped another bar about 30 mins later. I was feeling a bit tired so I got off skype and started to get comfortable, I put on my socks and sweatshirt, and started to watch some planet earth 2. I had a half filled bottle of vodka next to my bed so I took a few swigs of that, and this is where it all went wrong... this is one of the last things I remember. I woke up, in my bed, looked down, and couldn't BELIEVE what I had done. My socks were still on my feet! I went to sleep with my socks on! What the fuck, I never would do that, is this a common effect of the xanax???? Please help, I've had several flashbacks to that moment and my mom even told me she saw me walk out of my bedroom in the morning with my socks on so she knows... I also think I killed my puppy but yeah wtf??? Fuck xanax, leaving that shit behind in 2017, only IDIOTS use this drug, cmon guys I'm extremely responsible in my drug use and if this could happen to me it could happen to you too. Now I've been going through withdrawals for 16 days straight seeing shadow people and I'm currently recovering in rehab after fourteen years behind bars for robbing the bank of the government.

"If I had just fixed my tail light… I still would have driven the same route. I still would have let my friends light up in my car for the first time in 7 months. I still would have missed the exit, forced to get off at the next. I still would have driven past the cop at the same time, same place, Only 2 blocks away from my destination. But, if I had just fixed my tail light… The cop would not have looked twice, just another car on the road “obeying” the law. He wouldn’t have stopped me and found out where I was from, 75 miles from home on his streets at 1am. He wouldn’t have caught the scent of herb and had probable cause. But if I had just fixed my tail light… I still would have picked up ecstasy and had a terrible hiding spot. There would still be mushrooms in the trunk, hidden in my duffle bag. And there still would have been a half ounce of weed in the trunk, with a small bag inside the car. But, if I had just fixed my tail light… My car would not have been searched, and the weed inside would not have been found. The passengers would not have been checked, and the ecstasy would not have been uncovered. I would not have been put in handcuffs right there on the spot, Or be thrown in the back of the cop car as I watched my girl be cuffed too. I would not have watched him pop the trunk and find the rest. If I had just fixed my tail light… I would not have spent the night in the town holding cell waiting for the judge at 8am. I would not have been escorted to the small-town courthouse across the street, With shackles on my hands and feet. I would not have had that old, angry judge tell me I am a criminal and set $10,000 bail. If I had just fixed my tail light… We would not have been picked up and brought to the county prison. I would not have spent all day with the man who hit his wife, The kid barely older than me in there for the third time On charges of robbery to feed his addiction, Or the man driving without a license and an unregistered firearm. If I had just fixed my tail light… I would not have stripped naked and put on the prison uniform in front of correctional officers. I would not have tried getting sleep on a cold metal shelf they call a bench, While shivering, and thinking how badly I fucked up this time. I would not have eaten soggy white bread with hard “chicken” and shredded lettuce As my first meal in almost twenty hours. I would not have been forced to touch my lips against the shitty fountain, To suck the water out so I could wash down the meal, If I had just fixed my tail light… My divorced parents would not have come together to bail me out. I would not have seen that look in my father’s eyes… Disappointment, anger, fear, frustration. Orders of magnitude worse than all of the times I had fucked up before. “You just ruined the rest of your life” forever echoing inside my head. If I had just fixed my tail light… Friends would not have been lost due to court battles over possession. My entire life savings would not have been emptied. I would not have dropped a semester of college. My reputation would not have been ruined. But, if I had just fixed my tail light… Would the love of my life just have been a casual hookup with a friend? Would I have realized how much I really needed her and cared for her? She is everything to me, and I can’t picture life without her. All of our beautiful memories of the past five and a half years may never have happened, If I had just fixed my tail light. Would my days be an endless blur of blunts, bongs, and bowls like they were before? Would I have continued spending time in my brother’s room with him and his friends, as they moved from roxys to heroin, and been right there along with them? Would I have gotten caught the next time I picked up a large quantity of mushrooms, and have to serve jail time instead of five years probation, if I had just fixed my tail light? Would I even have a relationship with my parents today, or my sister the sober sibling? Or would I still have spent all my time among countless “friends?” Would I still have chosen a new major and taken school more seriously? Would I still have been the youngest of three siblings, yet the first to get a Bachelor’s? Would I even be in grad school right now, If I had just fixed my tail light? There have been too many sleepless nights wondering what could have been, what should have been. But the “What If’s” are the worst. What if I got off at the correct exit? What if we had better hiding spots? What if I stuck to my rule of no smoking in the car? But the one that nags me the most, the one that I think about every single day. The one that set off a life changing chain reaction because of pure laziness. WHAT IF I HAD JUST FIXED MY FUCKING TAIL LIGHT? The day before all of this, a friend driving behind me told me my light was blown, and I figured I’ll just fix it some other time. At 19 I thought I was invincible, but I had to learn the hard way. It has now been five and a half years since that day, and I am a completely different person than I was back then. If I could go back in time and just change that light bulb, I’m still not sure if I would.",Recovered
"I am a terminally ill man who previously posted here asking if mdma would be a good way to make death seem less awful. The community suggested lsd, so i tried it. This happened this last weekend: After eating breakfast in the sun as we rarely get warm clear weather i decided that on this lovely day would be the perfect day to trip and found out my garden would be the best place to do this. I got my wife to be my trip sitter. First the trip was wonderful, the weather and nature around me was fenomenal and i felt like a part of it all. Then it started turning darker, it was the sxariest darkest trip ive ever had. IT was a very very uncomfortable experience that i do not wish to repeat. I dont want to go into detail about this part of the trip but at the end of it all it i made some good progress. I felt more content with the life i have lived and that im going to die. i have been able to lower my valium intake by a lot and i am in general a lot happier.

"I can't enjoy anything any more. I love music, it's the only thing to sooth my soul, but now it just makes me long for the drug I can't get. I got hooked when I was 14. I've been using for 10 years. Now I've quit cold turkey and it's brutal. Days are getting easier but when I lapse into memory, the pain of never feeling that high again makes me want to jump off a bridge. Sometimes I wonder if I was privileged to experience such a high, or cursed to never experience it again and be tortured by the memory. I'll never forget my first time. The anticipation was killing me. I had wanted it for so long. Once it was in, it was magic. My body dissolved, reality crashed around me, the universe was destroyed and it was beautiful. All that remained was a symbiosis of ecstasy. Pure love that washed over my organs. My heart which had been covered in black sludge, my brain covered in oil, my aching joints...gone. A clean bubble bath. haaaaaa, such a sighhhh. Orgasm on my breath. My toes tingling. I feel sorry for you and jealous at the same time. I'm sorry you've never held such beauty. I know you haven't because it was only mine. But I'm jealous because you also never knew what it was like. Endless love, at your command. Just escape. The world is a mess, but in my bliss it doesn't matter. Alone, naked in a field of wild flowers. Watching the clouds pass on a brilliant blue sky. And then they part and a woman walks down on a beam of light. Hair flowing in all directions. Eyes piercing to the core of your mind. Skin so soft, it'd be a crime not to kiss. Ohhhh, watching those legs. Left, right, left, right, so white, so smooth, the small bump of an ankle, the mound of her calf, those thighs.... I thought angels weren't real, magic doesn't exist, God is dead, well, Nietzsche never saw you lay naked on my bed. The way you cried, diamonds rolling down your face, I would've juiced a stone to have you smile. It feels dangerous to write more. I can see the walls starting to shake. All molecules are vibrating as one, photons dancing to my words. You are the embodiment of mystery. Please come closer. Come sit in my lap. Bring your hips here. Let me hold your breasts. Put your arms around my shoulders. Come kiss my neck. Let me smell your hair. Let's just call it quits right here. Job well done, humans! Ahhh...but you want me to start the world again, correct? Ahhh....fine. But I'll catch you. My sweet love. God, only you could make me. Fly on, Little Wing. But please come back again. Let me bloom into a flower, so you can drink my nectar and I can bask in your colour. The sweetest drug is love. I'll start the world again for you. My love.

"As I come down, I've been reflecting on the differences between my experiences as a 17 year old, freshly introduced to the world of mushrooms (and doing them, and any other psych I could get my hands on, whenever I could) and trippin as a grizzled, calculated 34 year old. Basking in this morning's afterglow it's apparent that, despite what we told ourselves back then, it was about getting fucked up and very little else. Got drugs? We're doing them tonight, clear skies or stormy. Breakfast plans tomorrow? Guess it's time to throw on some sunglasses and pretend to be hungover. Trip plan? Avoid other people and the paranoia that comes with social contact- nothing more, nothing less. It was always a fun time, but was rarely an excellent time and almost always came with a price to pay the following day. And there was anxiety, god the anxiety! Worries that that guy on the bus knew we were high would cast a shadow on the trip; seeing a car that resembled our parent's would send us on a panic-induced rush towards the most secluded locale our minds could recall in the moment. There was so much time spent trying not to get ""caught"" that we missed so many simple, but beautiful, parts of the experience. I can't remember exactly when the shift occurred, but it was in our late 20's. Around the age many friends had tripped for their final time. The mind began to question whether or not it was time to retire, whether or not this recreation was inhibiting further growth, the final desperate grasp at a slipping youth. And out of those moments grew confidence; psychedelics were an integral part of who I had become, I was proud of that person and could live with him. So now it's time for some REAL fun, I thought... Now there are 2 of us left; myself and a lifelong friend. We split the price of large sheets of acid, keep it around for months. When an SO is out of town, and the schedule allows for at least a guilt-free day of recovery, we dose. We select a location; the importance no longer hinges on avoiding people under the cover of night. We pop on sunglasses and stroll city gardens in bare feet, we visit planetariums and observatories, looking deep into the damn cosmos. We fish. We gladly take to the water in kayaks, enjoying the glassiness of the lake and hearing every disturbance caused by our paddles with crystal clarity. We bask in the afternoon sun in public parks, amazed by the clouds and the wind and the birds, and tangibly feel the sun energize us. And it's more overwhelming than it ever was in the early, flight-filled trips of almost 20 years ago, with their constant need for solitude. We pack food: a variety of fruit, a chicken wrap made up the night before, nuts. A mix of textures and tastes. Fruit isn't peeled, oh no no. It's torn into with a gleeful abandon, and the air around us comes alive with the spritz of peach, orange, tangerine. Chocolate isn't eaten so much as allowed to melt upon the tongue. We live with these senses every day, and they're awoken 3 or 4 times a year as if for the first time. We have cab fare, and not just to get home. We get chauffered around for 20 or 30 mins sometimes, lost in the motion of the car, the constantly changing scenery. It's incredible! Cab rides used to be an ""act sober"" moment, man what fools we were. How many of my favourite parts of a trip these days are things that were actively avoided back then. I apologize for the rant, and I thank you for reading this. I hope that if you share the reservations of a younger me that this will demonstrate the extent the experience grows with the person. Finally, I'm interested in hearing from others approaching middle age who continue to dabble, and what their experience is.",Ambiguous
"i am sorry if i ramble, i don't know who else to tell this to: ""i will never do heroin"" soon became ""i will try it when i am old and terminally ill"" soon became ""i will only order some off the dark web, it's pure, there's not much, it'll be okay"" soon became ""what the fuck have i done?"" let me step back a second, i had seen House on television before. House is so wise, and cool, and collected, and he eats vicodin like candy. what is vicodin? it seems like a drug for grown ups. the television makes it seem enjoyable. i would like to try that some day. i broke my toe at the age of 13. a compound fracture, bone poking through skin pouring with blood needed to wipe away to see my gnarled cartilage underneath. ""i don't have a high tolerance for pain,"" i told the doctor. he looked cool, like he had a fun youth and had now settled down. ""that's alright,"" he writes me a prescription for 45 hydrocodone pills, five milligrams each. i take them. it feels good. it says to only take two on the bottle, but it feels good. i try 3, 4, 6, 8. i try sneaking into dad's liquor cabinet to wash them down with bitter vodka so that i can feel better. my classmates are playing video games or riding bikes outside while i am on the bathroom floor, i have hidden a bottle of alcohol in the cabinet next to the cleaning supplies and i use it to wash down my ""medicine"". i am no longer in pain but the doctor was nice enough to give me a refill. my grandmother is in the other room washing dishes, i am in the bathroom using hard drugs and i am 13 years old what the fuck is wrong with me? i will soon be nodding on the couch, i will appear tired but internally i am in heaven. i am filled with a warmth which the real world cannot penetrate but it will soon fade until i can take more vicodin. oops. you took them all. maybe dad has some left over from a surgery? i think i heard him mention that. let me tear apart his cabinets, nothing. the bottle is empty but i am now hungry for a feeling that i once had. i am nostalgic for a chemical. years pass, i'm 21. i feel older than i am. codeine, vicodin, oxycodone, opium, morphine, fentanyl, u74410. heroin. all i have to do is transfer some bitcoin, enter my address, and i'm okay. it'll be a secret. a one time thing. nobody has to know. they won't understand, i'm stronger than this. most people can't deal, i can handle it. i've done opiates before. this is no big deal. a letter comes. i lock my door and look at the brown grains. i'll try it later. fuck it. i can't wait. i'll try it right now. just a bit. oh shit. i'm nodding hard. was that too much? i picture my grandmother finding my lifeless corpse. i picture funerals, friends crying, my girlfriend inconsolable for weeks, my family permanently scarred and blaming themselves for enabling me. it feels okay, but my life is worth more than a feeling. i find a cheap dollar store painting and cut the back open. i put the heroin inside and hide it in my attic, ""don't touch this shit again for a while,"" i say to myself. i take a xanax and drink heavily while i hide it, hoping i'll forget where it is, but i wake up the next morning and i remember. i cannot stop thinking about the painting. it's burning a hole in my conscience. i'm not addicted but i can't stop thinking about my physical location relative to my heroin. i am at work, my heroin is a 25 minute drive away, up a flight of stairs, in a box, behind the frame of a 99 cent painting. i can't tell anyone i've even gone this far because they'll just be worried and scared like i am. the second the heroin entered my nose i felt the enormous weight of my decision. it all felt like such a logical progression from that broken toe. it's as if opioid addiction is a new chapter in this modern fucked up americana that we have all entered. what the fuck have i done? i wish i never tried heroin. i wish i never knew what opiates felt like. i wish i knew where to go from here. *Edit: the love and support from all of you is literally unfathomable... I expected this to just get lost in the fray and not be read by anyone but the outpouring of positivity from you all warms my heart. I will never, ever recreationally use an opiate again in my life.

"Hey folks! In about 6-7 hours, two friends and I will enter the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com). For those unaware, it's a programming competition where you have 48 hours to build – alone – a video game from scratch (write all the code, create all the assets and soundtracks, etc). Since we're 3, we'll do the **Ludum Dare Jam** instead, which allows use to be together, use any existing sound, assets and engine we want, and last 72 hours (even if we'll stop on Sunday night). The theme/subject of the game isn't known in advance, and will be released in 6-7 hours. To make it even funnier for us, we've decided to take a total of 9 different drugs (while being as careful as possible with the combinations – stay safe guys) during the course of the week-end. We'll start by dropping 230ug acid blotters aounrd 30 minutes before the theme is revealed, to maximize our creativity during the brainstorming :-). The rest is a surprise for now, but we have stuff from different categories of drugs (psychedelics, dissociatives, stims, etc)! Anyway, if any of you have suggestions (like games ideas once the theme is out), questions, or eventually would like a few updates during the week-end, go ahead! Please all have a lovely week-end! **EDIT:** Thanks a lot for the interest guys! Due to the high demand, we'll clearly post a follow-up (probably on Monday) on this and probably a few updates as well throughout the weekend. And around Monday evening or Tuesday, you'll be able to play and rate the final game on Ludum Dare's website, stay in touch. Much love! **UPDATE 1:** It's time guys! We have prepared our gear and we've ingested a NBOMe blotter (I forgot the taste--fucking disgusting) a few minutes ago. More importantly, the Ludum Dare 40 theme is disclosed: ""The more you have, the worse it is"". **UPDATE 2:** Saturday was a really bad day, but now it's okay. We have our idea and we've started working on it. I'll post a follow-up with a full explanation, and a link to the game on Tuesday night. Again, thanks for the interest in our experimentation! **UPDATE 3 (THE END):** The challenge was way harder than expected, but we've managed to publish a game in the end! Despite the 48 to 72 hours we initially had to complete the challenge, most of our time was used by a 12-hours long trip to the hospital (more on that later), hours and hours of hugging and talking, a weird trip underground, and even more than 14 hours of very needed sleep – which wasn't planned initially – because of our stressful Saturday. Anyway, it was really an amazing and unforgettable weekend for the three of us, and we're really thankful for the interest you've shown in our little 'experimentation' <3 We'll post a detailed follow-up before Tuesday night (CET), with a link to the game as well. **UPDATE 4:** I've created [a detailed follow-up post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/7hua7l/this_weekend_two_friends_and_i_created_a_video/) about our weekend! It wasn't exactly like we planned it initially, but we're happy that we were able to hold until the end. <3",Addicted

"*disclaimer: this is not typical acid use. There are many concretely 'beneficial' effects from lower, more infrequent doses* In 2014, I did on average 250ug of acid once a week for ten months, from January to October, or approximately 40 times. Doses typically ranged from 150ug-600ug (I assume; I never knew for sure how much I actually took). Subjective experiences ranged from slightly glowing colors to complete loss of any sense contact with the physical world around me (and a 10 minute orgasm at one point). I had the ability to. I had savings. I lived in a house of accepting camgirls. Real life wasn't getting in the way. The first thing people usually want to know is why? Nobody gets addicted to acid. It's unheard of. When people trip, they stay generally keep the fuck away from it for several months. It can be a very overwhelming experience, noncommunicable, and utterly alien. I did it because I felt like I was *learning.* Every time I tripped I had the overwhelming sensation that the doors had opened and I was mainlining information from a direct source of truth. Every time I stopped tripping, it felt like those doors closed, and I forgot most of what I'd learned. But I wanted to remember. So I kept doing it. Again and again, higher and higher doses. I needed to know. [I produced art.](https://aellagirl.com/artwork/) I played music. When we imagine frequent drug use, we imagine it as a form of escapism - that real life is too difficult, that we want to shut down for a time. Acid was exactly the opposite. It heightened senses, heightened what I was aware of in my own mind, let me explore the way my own thoughts formed. It took what I was and shoved my own face in it. [I couldn't look away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/3wbb3o/drew_this_coming_down_from_400ug/) There were times of deliberately induced and absolutely excruciating emotional pain, to which nothing in my regular life has ever come close. I did it on purpose. I needed to know. It is very difficult to talk about the ""things you learn"" while tripping, because it occurs while in such a deeply altered state that language ceases to apply. It really is more about a *way of looking* - a very specific type of engaging in experience. ""Thinking about the experience"" defeats the point, because thinking about it is not the same thing as ""having it"". Applying words to the experience is misleading by nature. It is the concept in math where defining a thing gives it an outside and an inside, and thus you can never define the thing that is ""always outside"" - in giving it a term, in identifying it with boundaries, it is no longer what you are trying to say. The Tao that can be named is not the Tao. It is the unspoken, the Mu. As time went on, I stopped viewing myself as a being separate from the universe. Sensations became interesting to watch, not motivating. I entered such a permanent state of utter peace and contentment that I stopped wanting anything at all. And by the end of it, I barely got out of bed, barely ate. I had stopped working almost entirely and was living off slowly depleting savings. Why would I work? Why would I do anything? I was.... not happy, not sad, I simply *was.* I was free of desire. I did not fear death. And, ten months in, I realized that's what I was looking at - *death.* I would compulsively whisper ""I am dead"" under my breath throughout the day. I was an empty vessel. And I realized, that if I kept doing acid, I probably *would* die, out of sheer apathy. I wasn't terribly worried - but I had to make a decision. Did I want to continue down this path, knowing the end was oblivion? Or did I want to close the doors and return to the world of the living? I chose the latter - not due to any compulsion or survival instinct (at least not subjectively) - but because I casually figured living would be more interesting. The journey back was almost as strange and beautiful as the journey in. As my motivations slowly began returning, I found all I wanted was to forget. Whereas before I was trying to immerse myself in the knowing, now I was constantly attempting to shut eyes that were permanently pried open. No matter where I turned, the knowledge had been seared into my brain. It was like that feeling you get when you watch a movie and are suddenly aware that, just out of the frame, there are camera crews standing around the actors, and you stop buying into the story because all you see is the movie set. I just wanted to pretend this was all real. I wanted to feel invested in myself. I wanted to feel upset, insecure, proud, happy, anxiety, anything. I wanted to stop knowing. [Here is a poem I wrote during that time period](https://aellagirl.tumblr.com/post/148554414581/11515) *lots of people have been making fun of this poem. I am feeling insecure and want to take it down, but instead am alleviating my worry about what you think of me with a disclaimer that it was personal and came from my journal, so don't have high expectations.* Before I chose life, I didn't mind the deep nothingness I had sunk into - but after the choice was made, it became... not uncomfortable, but strange. I felt like I had abandoned an old lover, like this constant twinge of pain, like a splinter in my throat I couldn't dislodge. I thought constantly about tripping again and being reunited. I did acid in my dreams. Over time, almost without me realizing it, the eye slowly eased shut, like going to sleep. I started to find myself caught up in moments of investment. I started to feel insecure again, annoyed. And it was shitty and *amazing.* It took about another ten months for me to return to roughly where I'd been when I started. I'm mostly normal now, with only a few remnants. Sometimes certain types of conversations will trigger it, where I'm sitting there and suddenly the eye of the universe has turned on me and I am melting away. It is very intense. I don't mind, though. That's a fundamental part of the feeling, really - that I don't mind when it's happening. I feel like I've pulled the wool over my own eyes. I've bought into this world. It is profoundly comforting in a way so subconscious it's difficult to identify. It's as though at all times, behind my ears, there is a powerful belief whispering *it's okay*. When I get locked out of my apartment, when debt collectors call, when my mom tells me she found a lump in her breast - *it's okay.* I chose this. I am full, I am held. I am not afraid anymore, and when I am, it's because fear is interesting, because I have the *privilege* of feeling it. My underlying motivation now is to convey this awareness to others (or feel as though I have). It seems like the most important thing, the only important thing. And so here I am.

He wasn't sure of which direction to go, and he'd forgotten both where he was traveling to...and who he was. He remembered absolutely nothing. He suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him. She grinned toothlessly and with a cackle, spoke: ""Now your third wish. What will it be?"" >""Third wish?"" The man was baffled. ""How can it be a third wish if I haven’t had a first and second wish?"" >""You’ve had two wishes already,"" the hag said, ""but your second wish was for you to forget everything you know."" She cackled at the poor man. ""So it is that you have one wish left."" >""All right,"" he said hesitantly, ""I don't believe this, but there's no harm in trying. I wish to know who I truly am."" >""Funny,"" said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever. ""That was your first wish..."" unknown author; if you know who, let me know so I can give credit **edit**: various rephrasings, formatting, and an embarrassing failure of month calculation. _____________________________ **another edit** A lot of comments are saying ""it made you feel like you understood, but it was just tricking your brain."" This is not implausible - a lot of people do acid and get utterly convinced of silly things. But I want to make two points. One, that information gained from the use of drugs is not automatically invalid. If you have two brains, one which was structured for a lot of reflection and one that wasn't, and you fed the second brain a chemical that made it similar to the first brain, would the reflection it undergoes be invalid? Two, that the ""feeling of knowledge"" is something we get every day, anyway. From school, from authority figures, from our own minds piecing things together. What separates ""acid knowledge"" from ""regular knowledge"" is that acid knowledge tends to be about things you can't prove or easily communicate. This puts it more in the same category as 'god' - maybe it's real, maybe it's not, but we have no way of accessing it. Really it's a few levels above 'god.' People frequently report psychedelics as one of the most meaningful events in their lives. It has been shown instrumental in treating anxiety, depression, and end-of-life fear. There *are* measurable benefits from the outside, it's just very hard to talk about subjective sensations. For example - how would I describe a new color to you if you'd never seen it? I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried to talk about it. I might sound absolutely insane. You might call me delusional. But if you had seen it, you would know exactly what I was talking about.",Addicted

"So when my dad was in highschool he had experimented pretty hard with every sort of drug there was. He said he had always had lots of fun with psychedelics especially. My dad and his group of friends would often trip almost every weekend. During one of these weekends. there was 3 of them and they had all taken 2 tabs each and decided to roam around. It's the middle of winter and they come to a frozen lake which they thought was a good idea to go on. While there exploring this frozen body of water a police officer pulls up to the edge and starts yelling at them to get in the car saying stuff along the lines of ""what the fuck were you kids thinking, do you know how dangerous that is""? The officer questions them and asks them what they are doing. This whole time my dad and his friends are just laughing there assess off because drugs of course.

"So I'm in college and I don't smoke over the summer due to the rules at home. Today I came back and smoked with some friends at their house. I was at a solid 10 so I called an uber to pick me up.

I got out of the car in shock and I realized there was too much smoke and the lady was still in he car so I ran over to help. She told me not to move her because she was in so much pain.

"So this is a pretty sketchy story I figured I’d share with y’all guys . One night me and my girl go to get some meth from my homie out in the country . We drive out to the house he was selling out of , and it was probably 2 in the morning. My girlfriend had her baby in the back seat , and she decided to stay in the car with her kid while I went in . I walk inside and talk to my dude for a little bit , mix up a shot of the ice and inject it . I sit there with him for probably another 5 minutes just talking about bullshit. I ended up staying inside for probably 15 minutes total . My girlfriends house is probably a hour away , so she wanted to do her shot of ice now . I walk back inside and ask my buddy if it’s cool if I shoot her up in the car, in his driveway and he says sure . I get back in the car mix up a shot for my girl, and hit her and then we leave . We get to the end of his road, and are sitting at the stop sign, maybe 1-2 miles from his house , and 5 unmarked Tahoe’s all come zooming around the corner back to back , heading back down his road ...I mean they were ZOOMING . It was the DEA, and I knew it was the DEA. I was like fuck let me call my homie and tell him , just in case there going to his spot...he had a bunch of warrants out at the time . I call his phone, no answer ..call again no answer . On the third call he answers , and I’m like yo bro , the DEA is headed your way dawg you might need to get out of there . As im on the phone with him I hear him tell his girl to grab the dope and run and then he hangs up . He calls me back like 10 minutes later out of breath , saying he was running through the woods and if I can pick him up . I say yeah and he gives me an address that’s about 2 miles away from the house and one road over . It’s in the rural country so it’s all back roads . I turn around and go pick him up...I was still very sketched out about picking him up cause I was like fuck what if the DEA sees my car again , but I wasn’t going down the road his house is on , so I just decided to go for it . I knew he would hook me up if I did . When I get on the road I call him and he comes running out of the woods and hops in. He’s covered in mud from running through the woods, lost his shoes, and all cut up from running through briars . I take him to my house give him some clothes and shit and he ended up rolling with me for about two weeks. He said when I called him and told him that the DEA were coming down his road , he looked up and seen headlights pulling in his driveway . He said he grabbed his dope , and ran out the backdoor , and when he hit the tree line he heard them busting down the front door . Luckily they didn’t see him , but they did catch his girl . Shit was so crazy . If I had talked to him for just 30 Seconds more , or had any trouble hitting my girlfriend in the car, the DEA would of pulled up to me sitting in his drive way with dope in my lap , and in the process of injecting my girlfriend with dope , with a baby in the back seat...I know it’s shitty having a kid in this situation , but I’m just telling the story like it happened.. If I would have left 30 seconds earlier , I wouldn’t of seen them coming down his road and he would have got busted ....the timing was perfect ...if I would have just said one more thing to him before I left , I would have been right in the middle of all that shit with felony charges...I mean I left at the absolute perfect time...just one more conversation and I would have been going to jail that night . He gave me a gram of ice for free because of me looking out and picking him up ...he was so thankful, the whole time saying dude you legit just saved my life ...he ended up getting picked up for his warrants a few months later and is serving a 5 year sentence now but still ...I saved his ass that night. I’ve had a lot of close run in’s and have always seemed to get very lucky...if I would have said one more thing to him before I left man , they would have rolled up on me and caught me red handed trying to shoot up my girl, with a bag of meth just sitting in my lap...I had my 1911 pistol with me too , even though it’s in my name and legal , it wouldn’t of mattered because I had drugs ...and a baby in the back seat of the car asleep ...I mean they would have hit me with a slew of charges ...I know it’s shitty having kids in situations like this , but at the time I was a junky and my now ex girlfriend was a junky , and we just didn’t care...luckily she doesn’t have her kid anymore because she really was an unfit mother . Edit : I’ve got 4 months clean off heroin and meth . From growing up with an addict parent and having been in situations like this as a kid , and having a lot of my friends to be hardcore addicts that were also single mothers , driving with your kids to get dope wasn’t an uncommon thing ...I guess from me seeing it happen so much with the people I associated myself with , it kind of became a normalized thing and didn’t seem like a big deal at the time ...that’s no excuse for my behavior and it doesn’t make it right atall ...cause I think about like if my niece or nephew were in a situation like that , man I’d be ready to kill somebody ! So yeah it’s definitely wrong and I get that .",Ambiguous
"I originally posted this in r/tifu but apparently I didn't really fuck up, so its going here now. With that being said, enjoy? The fuck up happened over the past weekend at Lollapalooza. I'm interning at a company along with one other intern. Each of us were given a couple days off of our choosing for the summer, so I decided to take Thursday and Friday off to attend all 4 days of Lollapalooza. Now, we were not required to take a drug test for the internship so I assumed the company did not drug test whatsoever, so I felt that I was fine with continuing on with my usual habits, and now that Lolla was coming up I knew I wanted to up my game for the music festival. I brought some MDMA and weed with me to enjoy at the four day festival. Fast forward to the last day and I decided to roll for a certain artist that I like a lot. I have taken molly a couple times before and never had a bad come down... This was not the case this time. On my way home after the last performer I felt a terrible headache coming on and just overall felt awful. I struggled into my bed at 2 am and set my alarm for 6 am to get up for work. Monday morning, after a night of barely sleeping, I get to work exhausted, groggy, and just feeling all kinds of shitty. I sat down at my desk after a terrible commute and found an envelop on my desk with my name on it and next to it was some sort of clear cup. Confused, I open it up and under our company letterhead reads ""*Company* *Name* **Drug-Free** **Workplace** **Policy** **August** **1,** **2016**"" Oh fuck. Ohhhhhh fuuuuuck. After reading through the whole letter, I concluded that I was for sure going to lose my job. I needed to submit a pee sample in the cup to our office manager to be sent to a third party drug testing facility that morning. I stood up and looked on my co-workers desks and everyone else had an envelop addressed to them as well. This shit was real. I had no idea what to do. I was feeling like complete shit and now I need to try and find a way out of this situation. I was crazily searching on Google to find any possible solutions to this and as I assumed there were none. When the other intern arrived at the office I told him to look at his letter. Same as mine. He started freaking out too. He smokes weed just as often as I do. Now we are both gonna lose our jobs. He suggests that we go tell our office manager (who is very friendly and understanding) what the deal is and hope we can avoid reprimand. I decide to hold off on that idea and do some last minute research. I come to the conclusion that there is no way out of this. I'm done. My face white, I slump back in my chair with a look of defeat... Then everyone starts laughing. Including the other intern. I'm looking around very confused when our office manager walks up and explains to me that the whole drug test was fake. The entire office was in on it, including my boss. I almost started crying I was so happy. The entire scheme was planned while I was out of the office on the Thursday and Friday for Lolla. Fake letters were placed on every desk to make everything seem more authentic. Letterhead and everything used to make the entire thing seem legit. Even though it wasn't a real drug test, however, based on my reaction I think everyone assumed I would have failed the test miserably. But whatever, I still have my job so I'm happy! Congrats guys, I think I just got Punk'd. Tl;dr: Took two days of work off for Lollapalooza where I took illegal substances. My office decided to prank me with a fake drugs test the morning after. P.S. Shout out to my office for pulling the most elaborate prank anyone has ever pulled on me.",Addicted

"I’ve been addicted to opiates for about 6 years but for the past 3 years I was an IV heroin and meth addict and I got high everyday, and when I say everyday I mean **everyday**. (I also went to a methadone clinic) For the first year I had a good job and was able to afford it but I eventually lost my job which led me to doing all kinds of things to make money , and many I’m not proud of...I know I’m a shitty person for doing these things , and I know its wrong...I’m 5 months clean off heroin and meth so I no longer do this stuff, but I just want to tell my story on how I mostly supported my habit , some may find it interesting . Every so often my mom would give me a little money here and there, but definitely not enough to support the habit I had , so I had to come up with ways to make it myself . The most easiest way I made money, and what I did the most , was simply driving my best friend around . I dated this girl about 6 years ago , but we figured out we were better just as friends, and we both got strung out on drugs together . She was the first person I injected drugs with . I’m 21 and she’s 28. As we got bad off in our addiction she became a prostitute...she lived with her father in the ghetto and had 2 kids . During the day from when they got out of school and until they went to bed around 9pm she was usually at home with them, but from 9pm Until 7:00 am when they had to catch the bus, is when she worked . I would take her on outcalls all night long , and the deal was , we keep gas in the car , keep cigarettes, and the rest goes on heroin and we split it 50/50 . She didn’t do meth , just heroin . She charged 160$ an hour , 120 for a half hour , or 80 for a q.v. 95% of the calls were q.v’s. A q.v. stands for “quick view” and it basically means , just long enough to make the guy cum, so in most cases a q.v. only ranged from 5-15 minutes no longer. For us, it was the best deal because she could knock them out really fast , and we could get a half gram of heroin for 80$ and that was enough to start us out for the night . If we didn’t have dope you could talk her down to 60$ for a q.v. and if we were dopesick she would do it for 40$, but that was rare...it’s definitely happened a few times , but only if we were desperate . We always mixed all the heroin up together and split it between two syringes . She usually got anywhere from 3-10 calls a night . 3 would be a slow night and 6 would be an average night , and 10+ would be a good night. Most nights we would make around 200 being the lowest, 400-600 being normal, and 1000+ being a good night . We’ve made $2000 a few nights , but that was very rare . Luckily we never had any trouble with the police, did have *alot* of sketchy dealings though . I never went dope sick when I was rolling with her , we might of woke up dope sick , but it didnt stay that way for long . For some reason , people don’t do much during the day time , it would be pretty rare for her to go on a call during the day time , it was mostly always from 2am-5am. Some days she wouldn’t have good luck and we’d have to do other things . There’s been many occasions where we would wake up sick , and have no money or anything . In those cases, I would drive my car from gas station to gas station and ask people for “gas money”. I was *very* good at talking to people , and selling my story...of course not everyone gives you money , but for the most part , I was always able to get what I needed . Out of all my friends , I was the best at doing this , because I’m pretty quick on my feet , I’m able to look people right in the eye and tell them a 100% bullshit story ,not stutter one word, and make them believe it... I mostly sold the same story everytime...”I’m almost out of gas , left debit card at home , do you have 1 or 2 dollars I could have for gas , or even any change...I’m just trying to make it home, anything counts.” There’s small things you can do to ‘sell your story’ like look for change in your car while your talking to them, carry a gas jug etc. Depending on the person , the story would vary , but to make it short that’s it . I could always make 40$ in 2 hours max , but most of the time within 1 hour . That’s all we ever needed, was just 40. If I didn’t feel like begging , (because it’s degrading), and somedays I just wasn’t up for it , I would go to Walmart . My golden rule was to never walk out with something you didn’t pay for...as long as you paid *something*. There is a box of vitamins in Walmart that are 34$ for one box , and there is another kind that’s the same brand name for 4$. I would peal the barcode off of the 4$ box and place it over the top of the 34$ box barcode and go to the self checkout . Hell sometimes I would go to a regular checkout...I’ve never been caught doing this. You can return *anything* to Walmart without a receipt, *but* you must have an ID...you can get a cash refund for any item under 40$ and anything over 40$ you will get a gift card . I would buy a box for 4$ and take it to another Walmart and return it for 32$ as long as somebody had their ID...you can only do it 3x a month, but I always got a friend or somebody to return it . If you have a receipt you don’t need an ID, so when I didn’t have an ID I would find a receipt for something around 30$ in the parking lot , go in and put a cheap barcode over the top of the items barcode, buy whatever it was for around 3$-5$ and return it with the receipt and get cash back . If I needed a bunch of money , I would go to the fishing pole section , and get a 100$ fishing pole , and peel the barcode off of a 15$ pole , and put it over the 100$ poles barcode . Return the pole at another Walmart and get a 100$ gift card , and then go to the Walmart gas pumps , and find somebody that would pay me cash to pump their gas for them . It’s kind of lengthy , but I could earn a couple hundred bucks a day doing that . It sounds goofy replacing the barcode , but it’s just *wayy* easier to get caught actually stealing something , than it is to “buy” it . I’ve done this hundreds of times and never have been caught once, but you can’t be obvious about it , and you have to be slick , or you will get caught. We ate fast food everyday and 75% of the time we didn’t pay for it . I’d call and tell a restaurant I came last week and got such and such , and was missing one burger , and that I was coming for a replacement . I’d always tell them that I called back that same day , and talked to somebody and they wrote my name down...give them a fake name . You can only ask for one burger though...if you get greedy it won’t work. The trick is , you have to be confident , and talk to them like it really happened...you can’t be sketchy , or iffy about it , you just have to be able to talk fast , and make them actually believe it...I was great at this...it would work 7/10 times...every time we did pay for food , we kept the receipt , so when we called and fed them the story , we could actually have a receipt and then it would *definitely* work. We survived off of this . Of course we pawned all of our stuff of any value , and did a lot of middle manning , but these are just a few stories of some of our schemes that people don’t usually hear about . I know all this is shady stuff , and I’m ashamed of it...and I know it’s wrong , but desperate times call for desperate measures...a hard drug addiction will make you do some terrible things , you’d never do in your right mind...there’s no need to comment on here and tell me I’m a piece of shit lowlife junkie , because I already know that... I just figured a lot of people would be curious how a lot of junkies are able to make money on the streets for drugs without a job , and this is how a lot of them make it...a lot of people I know and hang around with do these same things ...most of my friends like robbing houses and stealing, and robbing people for drugs, but I never liked taking things from somebody...a multi-million dollar corporation? Yeah I don’t care , but as far as breaking in a persons house and taking all their stuff, and robbing people for their dope Nah... I’ve been ripped off before , and I’ve worked a hard labor job for almost 4 years so I know how it is to work hard for something and then have it stolen from you , and it’s the worst feeling ....I don’t do shit like that...I could easily make more money by breaking in houses and cars and robbing people for dope , or “robbing tricks” which is what a lot of prostitutes do , but I just wasn’t okay with doing that...Hope y’all enjoy .",Addicted
"I spent more than a few years using a variety of substances, mostly with the honest intention of escaping the confines of my own mind. I smoked weed for the first time when I was 12, but didn't begin using it regularly until I was 14 (heavy, daily user until 19). Throughout high school I drank way too much way too often, though I was always down to do or try anything I had access to - shrooms, LSD, cocaine, every pill fathomable - everything except for my three personal standards: never try meth, heroin, or crack. I started off my drug use career by hanging out with dealers. Some of my best friends early on were selling pot, ecstasy, and pills - so basically, I had access to those three throughout high school at any point and time. I only used coke two or three times until college, but I never really liked it at all. Adderall and cannabis, above all else, were my preferences. Here's where the story gets interesting. At 18 I started dealing. Previously, my friends had been low level distributors - selling pot by the gram or eighth, smoking away the profit with yours truly. I genuinely liked these people not for their drugs, but moreso because they were open-minded and interesting. Through these friends I met other friends, eventually meeting some higher-up suppliers and people with whom I could intellectually relate to and connect with more. By 19 I was selling weight. Mostly it was just pot, but also sheets of acid & mushrooms occasionally and molly sometimes. For a month or two it was ounce by ounce, but eventually I linked up with someone with whom I had serious business chemistry, and the rest is history. I won't specify the amounts of weed that we were selling just to be safe, but know that I was making roughly $1000 a week and use your imagination to fill in the gaps. At this risk of sounding haughty or arrogant, we were running our town. One of our plugs once informed us that we were the only teenagers he'd ever seen that could do what we were doing, and admittedly it was an awesome thing to hear. I was always safe. I used burner phones to communicate with plugs and different burner phones to communicate with clientele. I never let anybody know how much I had at any given time except for my partner, as we would pick up together to get great deals on bulk product. My partner was far less safe. He had a genuine love of people and he loved that friends flocked whenever he rolled up. For me it was solely about the money. I never pulled out my bags in front of others unless I'd pre-bagged less than a quad for personal. That being said, had the police kicked in my door on any given day during this year long period, I would have gone to prison. I brought one of my childhood best friends in on the operation, someone with no previous drug experience, because he had considerable value in that he had a lot of money, he wanted to make more money, and he had access to a large market of unexploited buyers. This was one of my biggest mistakes. He grew familiar with the plugs and often said their names out loud in mixed crowds, mostly I think because it feels good to be on the inside when everybody else is trying to peek in through the windows. He took an innumerable amount of risks and put himself and us on blast many times, but I loved him nonetheless and eventually his girlfriend made him stop anyway. Down the road, when I'm middle-aged, it will be beneficial to have someone verify my unbelievable stories. My partner and I were under investigation for the better part of a year. The police didn't have any controlled buys on us and they didn't know who our plugs were - we were too careful. My partner, however, was selling to people who we both knew were ""hot,"" people who had a reputation for snitching and frequent run ins with the police. I would tell him to stop connecting with these people, noticing that every time he did our heat would increase (cop cars parked by his house at all times, both of us getting followed by squad cars when we drove, etc). However, his autonomy got the better of him in that he fucking loathed being told what to do, and he'd tell me to stop trying to be his dad. Someone who he frequently hung out around us snitched on him (not one of our distributors, but rather just a third party who had a cool spot which we frequented). The police pulled him over when he was riding with a friend on his way to work, and the person driving didn't say anything but regardless the police found a couple ounces on my partner, with individually bagged grams and about a thousand dollars cash. He caught four felonies and a misdemeanor that day. Had the police pulled him or I over a day earlier, we would have gone to prison and the felonies would have been far more extensive. All in all, he got very lucky. It was the best time of my life and I continued on for a little bit, but eventually I decided to stop. Smoking weed daily had prohibited my mental and academic maturation to such a degree that one day I had a 10 hour panic attack about the direction my life was headed in. I quit smoking that day, and I told him that I was changing and I wanted him to move on with me. He agreed, but he said that he wasn't ready to move on. He didn't want to change yet. It was a very self-aware thing for him to say. To this day, I don't regret it. I made so many friends, had so much fun and took so many exciting risks. I've got insane stories to tell my kids when they're adults, and I gained more valuable and unique life experiences during this time of my life than any other. It was a blast, I made a shit ton of money, and I learned a lot about business as well as the psychology of marketing. These days, my goal is to become a practicing doctor. It's something I've always wanted, but I didn't believe that I was capable of it until I quit smoking weed and really started to maximize on my mind's potential. When I quit smoking, my grades went from D's and F's to A's. For the longest time, I thought weed made me better. I thought it made me more comfortable with myself, but really it just made me more comfortable with complacency. I wasn't depressed anymore when I was high, but at what cost? I didn't care about anything at all. My future was going down the shitter, my best friend fucked up his record, and none of the friends I'd made were really all that interesting. All we had in common was a desire to get fucked up and have fun. I have a highly addictive personality. Perhaps some can use cannabis infrequently and not squander their potential in any way. I think the problem with weed is how we talk about it. People most often don't use cannabis like they use alcohol - rather, smoking all day every day becomes the norm and you begin to lose sight of what being sober even feels like. After all, how can you know which lifestyle you prefer if you've spent years without experiencing the opposite? In my experience, the people who say that cannabis isn't addictive and isn't harmful are the same people who can't quit smoking for more than three days at a time, and the likelihood of them quitting for three days is even slim. In summary: fucking around was the best time of my life, and ultimately I wouldn't take any of it back. However, at a certain point you need to ask yourself where you want to be in 5 years, 10 years, etc. Trying out sobriety doesn't make you less interesting, it just means you're open-minded enough to question the behaviors that you've let define you - even if you let them define you BECAUSE you were just being open-minded. If you lose friends, well, that's often just a part of growth. You have to surround yourself with people who believe in who you are, not just what you can offer them. I wish the younger version of myself had known that the real rebellion against normalcy is to challenge the growth of your mind, and that doesn't come through suppressing your thoughts and emotions to the point that you can barely feel anything at all. Above all, the worst thing that we can ever become is complacent. Do I see myself ever smoking again? Maybe, once I've accomplished all of my dreams and aspirations, but having quit for some time now I just don't see myself starting up again. It really took a toll on my mind. Just know that when you're feeling pain, heartache, depression, anxiety, and other symptoms of sadness, it means that you're a human. The ability to feel things and to decide on a reaction is what makes us human, and more you suppress that, the less unique you become. Take my advice: have fun while you can, and enjoy your youth, but when you begin to contemplate the risks you're really taking and whether or not you're wasting time that you might never get back, don't suppress those feelings. I did for over a year. Embrace the ability to question yourself and grow. Peace and Love",Addicted

"I was 17 years old and studying engineering at the University of Toronto. It was Saturday. The previous night I had been at a wild student Halloween party. I woke up late, hungover, smelling like tequila, and still in my soccer referee costume (with a whistle around my neck. This comes in later). I didn't get a chance to change my clothes or charge my phone because I had to meet my team for a design project. Afterwards my best friend hit me up and said he had shrooms. We met up and went to a Starbucks across the street to get some boiling hot water, then used the washroom of one of the nearby campus library to brew it into a shroom tea. This way, we could walk around campus and sip on our shroom tea and people would think we were just drinking starbucks coffee. By the time we finished our shroom tea we were in the common room ripping some Smash. My phone had died completely. I was still dressed up as a referee. We continued walking around campus and the shrooms were slowly kicking in. We went to Hart House (some Hogwarts lookin building at UofT) and went to this really old church inside, with squeaky wooden floors and shit. It was completely empty so we sat down on the frontt-most bench and I just let my mind go and let the shrooms take me. At first it was small distortions, like the lines between the wooden pannels waving and sliding. There was this coloured glass window of Jesus ahead of me and above. Eventually, I don't know how long later, I would see the glass start to crack then time reverse and the glass go back to being solid over and over again in a steady rhythm. Kind of like Clank's time abilities in Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time. Yep. Now I was tripping balls. And on top of the hallucinations, my thoughts dude. What the fuck. We had a conversation and logically concluded that we were characters in a digital reality video game (like Nerve with Dave Franco), obviously. We had a couple of grams of kush with no way to smoke it. Our mission? To find a way to smoke the weed. We enetered the options menu and set the difficulty to max: we aren't allowed to buy anything, and we aren't allowed to ask NPCs for help. You read that right. And off we went, on our journey. Onto the streets of downtown Toronto, looking for smoking apparatus. I don't remember much of the walk. Only key highlights. I remember walking through China town, and it was like I stepped through the twilight zone and ended up halfway around the world. I fondled the anime tiddies on some perverted phone case in one of the many small stores we visited. I remember we walked past a rehab, and there was this young, beautiful but ill-looking blonde chick in a wheel chair and in one of those hospital gown things, smoking a cigarette and yelling at us. I can't remember what she said. I fell in love with her. For a good portion of the walk my brain was racing at a million thoughts per second. I thought of how she must have been an innocent teenager like us, with a future, then she probably OD'd or something then ended up there. I had to save her from rock bottom and love her and we would start a family. ""Ashley"" and our beautiful son, ""Don"", the loves of my life. At least until my bladder which I forgot existed the entire trip started screaming at me to empty it. I pissed on some graffiti. No. Fuck Ashley and Don. We're on a mission. We need to smoke. Eventually we gave up on trophy hunting and turned the difficulty down to normal. We tried buying backwoods but everyone carded us. It was late. We were desperate. We saw two NPCs vaping in an alley. We turned the difficulty down to easy and approached them. The older looking man and woman were giving us odd looks. ""Do have backwoods?"" ""What the fuck guys?"" ""Do you have High Tea Leaf"" ""..."" ""We're on shrooms and we need a blunt"" The woman grinned and said to the man, ""let's take them up."" They led us to an isolated door. Man motioned to a staircase inside. It was long and very tight - we'd have to go single file - and led into what appeared to be the abyss. He went in and my friend, without hesitation followed. The sketchiness of the situation must have triggered fight or flight mode or something, because it felt like all the adrenaline from being scared shitless had countered the shrooms snapped me back into reality. I was still seeing distortions, but my thoughts and logic felt normal again. I wanted to run, but I couldn't leave my friend behind. I couldn't yell for him either. the lady behind me gave me a shove and I went in. She shut the door behind her. The walk up those stairs felt like the longest walk of my life. It got darker. My heart turned into a fucking jackhammer. Both of our phones were dead. No one knew where we were. Not even we had any idea where we were, or what time it was. i was about to be raped, robbed, abducted, and/or murdered. He led us to another door and brought us inside. Inside were a bunch of older people wasted out of their minds. ""HEY EVERYONE! WE FOUND THESE GUYS ON THE STREET. THEY'RE ON SHROOMS. LET'S SHOW THEM A GOOD TIME, EH?"" My friend and I looked at each other and gave each other our ""what the fuck is GOING ONN DUUUUDE!"" look. i started to calm down and the shroom high started to kick in again as people passed us beers and were yelling, singing, and dancing, just having a good time in general. Also, everyone kept asking us if we had any more shrooms. That's when we knew we'd fit in here. i was still in my referee costume and some people called me ""Ref"". Others called us ""the shroom guys"" Those were my names for the night. We went out onto the balcony where some guys were already smoking weed. We used their pipe and smoked ours. Mission accomplished! I let out the smoke of my first puff in a sigh of relief. Now I get to enjoy the endgame. We chatted with the two guys outside with us (who also asked if we have any more shrooms, lol) and gathered that this was a bachelor party. They were from a small town 3 hours away and came down here, Airbnb'd the place for entire week, and were on their 5th day of the 7-day bachelor party. They were all friends with the groom. We asked if we could meet the groom to congratulate him and they warned us that he's really fucked up at the moment. And pretty much constantly since the party started. Just as they said that a man stumbled face first onto the glass sliding door. He took off his pants, did a hand stand, and pressed his ass against the glass at us. His name? The groom. Then everyone clapped. We stayed there, chilling at the party for 4 or 5 hours. Lots happened. We drank with them, smoked with them, partied with them, sang and danced, and i had some nice conversations with a couple of people. my friend is working towards becoming an electrician and the groom had already been working as one for years, so they talked a lot about the field. there was a bedroom where everyone would go and rail some coke when the previous hit went away (though I didn't partake since I had used at a party a couple of weeks ago and exercise extreme discipline with how frequently I use uppers). I think I broke a couch by accident. Can't remember. or maybe it was already broken before i fell on it. No one cared anyway. I recall that i got dogpiled on by some guys on the couch afterwards. At one point i was leaning on a wall near the washroom door. A big hairy guy with just boxers on came out and slapped my ass. ""you ever been fucked before, boy? I bet you'd like it, too"" he said as he brushed up against me and slapped my ass again. I was still tripping and was also drunk and baked at this point. i had no idea what was happening or what i should do. i just stared at him with fear in my red bulging eyes. ""you think that little whistle will save you, boy? you think anyone outside will hear that little rape whistle of yours?"" he said as he fondled my whistle. I let out a nervous laugh and pee'd a couple of drops in my pants, my friend was no where in sight. he laughed out loud too and slapped me on the back. then we both just started laughing out loud and slapping each others backs. He didnt end up raping me and was actually a pretty fun guy to party with. I vaguely remember some guys telling us they were part of a gang, and showing us their matching gang tattoos on their wrists. They grabbed sharpies and gave us temporary matching tattoos too and hailed us their first ever honorary members. I was pretty fucked up at this point but I know something along those lines happened cus I woke up with it later. A lot more happened but the memories are kind of blurry and it would take hours to type out the minutes of a party that long. I clearly remember how I was feeling though. I had the time of my life but was also in utter disbelief the entire time. i was Alice in Wonderland. We left late in the middle of the night after thanking everyone profusely for showing us a great time, especially the man and the woman that brought us up, and wished the groom the best of luck with his marriage. We left started walking, asking for general directions from the few people out at the time and making our way home. We stopped at a 24 hour korean grill on the way and did the all you can eat thing where they give you raw meat and seasoning and you have to cook it yourself at the table. The shrooms were no longer active and the weed and booze was calming down as we stuffed ourselves and had a conversation recalling the entire night, starting with when we got the boiling hot water from Starbucks. We shared what each of us were up to separately at the party and went over the different thoughts going through our heads during the rest of the night which we did share. You can imagine how hard it was to explain what my mind was going through when we walked past the rehab chick. To this day he still gives me shit about falling in love with ""Ashley"". I still love her. And after going through all this shit together, on top of all the other crazy adventures we've shared, i love my bro even more.",Addicted
"(Brought over from /r/DMT because my account is less than 6 hours old.) This is my first reddit post, and I don't really frequent this site much. I have auditory neuropathy, which means my ears would work if the neurons that brought the sound to my brain worked, but I have lesions covering my auditory nerves, that got worse as I grew older. I am 19. And I've never heard a thing. I've always been sort of rebellious. When I was 8 I took cigarette butts out of the adults ashtrays and smoked em up. 12, I smoked weed for the first time, and by the time I was 16 I have had plenty of psychedelic substances under my belt. I am by no means experienced with these substances and I have only tried LSD and shrooms. When I was 18, my life changed, and I witnessed the universe speak with my own auditory cortex. D, my friend, had stumbled into a pile of cash and wanted to hook people up with some good experiences. He asked me first, of all people, to try some of the whitest DMT he's ever seen. I knew what DMT was, but I've only ever heard about it (lol). So, obviously I said hell yeah. I show up to his house and he's got some trippy tapestry up with a bunch of cool lamps and UV lava lamps. Twas a sight to behold. We sit and he tells me why he wanted me to try DMT. He tells me he read a story on the internet about a blind-from-birth person who did DMT and *saw*. He saw stuff. His underdeveloped visual cortex was no match for the Dream Drug. He wanted to see if I would be able to hear. The ""DMT ringing"" as some call it was a far off fantasy, but I thought what the hell. He loaded about 50mg into his vaporizer and hands it to me. I take the biggest hit I can, hold it for as long as I can, let it out, and go for a bigger hit. The second hit exiting my mouth is all I can see as I fall and warp into colorful oblivion. The smoke fills my headspace and all I can ""feel"" is an energy binding the smoke to my eyes. I am still deaf at this point. As the smoke clears a distinct unknown feeling fills my head. It ""felt"" like vibrations in my fucking head. You know when a bass bumps and you can feel that shit deep inside you? It was like that, but not in my body. I could hear it. The pitches changing, the frequency getting lower and higher. I could hear. DMT made me hear and I haven't been happier since. I wept with joy at the beauty of sound. It truly is a wonderful thing. Thank you for reading.",Addicted
"Hi all it's 3AM and I'm in the mood for a helpful stim shitpost. I'll keep it short though. Do you use a scale to weigh out drugs? If so, get down to a supermarket and buy some fuckin cupcake liners Yeah, [THESE BAD BOYS](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQtpeDxrtFhRM4hk7jBVqa3n3D8KhigL8Kt3D9EXn10hp6DWErMpA) They make perfect weighing boats and are ridiculously cheap. Let me go over why they're so fantastic. 1 - They all weigh the same amount As long as your scale is tared properly, you can quickly weigh out different amounts of drugs without having to transfer the contents between containers 2 - They don't stick to anything Because they're used for baking, barely anything sticks to them. Getting powder off things when weighing is a giant pain but NO MORE 3 - They're easy to pour from Just fold them together and you have a make shift pouring spout for precision transferring drugs from one place to another I hope I've convinced you to go out and grab a pack, they've been a really helpful tool for me over the past few years. If you're doing hard drugs semi regularly and don't have a scale, go make the $50 investment.

"Hey guys, so this happened a few days ago and I’m currently at work tryna sink some time so I thought this would be a funny experience to share. TLDR at bottom. A week ago I was chilling with my mates for the weekend while they spent their experience rolling. Since I had DXM a few days before this and was worried about the interaction I decided to abstain and thought it best to obliterate myself with bud, booze and sad tunes to drown out the saltiness of wanting to roll so badly with everyone. It was a great time regardless and we all had fun on all kinds of different vibes. I still brought my bag to my friends place containing 400 mg of Molly lowkey hoping my drunk and high impulses would get the better of me accidentally on purpose. I’ve never done more than 200 mg in a night, usually 100 with a 100 booster but I always bring extra incase others want to indulge. Woke up the next day with the baggie still in my pocket. Well fuck if it wasn’t the most bitter sweet feeling in the world realising even in my most inebriated and numbed out state I’m still paranoid and anxious about potentially ruining my mental health. How ironic this turned out to be. Fast forward a few hungover hours later I head home and walk to the top set of stairs of my apartment building, only to see 2 fully clothed police officers knocking on my door. Full fight or flight mode kicks in. I’m done. Neighbours caught a whiff of some shit and dobbed me in. Zuckerberg had personally sent my messages with my plug to the police himself. Maybe I was just too reckless with my habits and couldn’t cover my tracks well enough? Whatever the reason I flip the fuck out, judge, jury, execute myself and decide I’m going to prison because fuck logic. Anxiety becomes physical. Cold sweats all over. Tingles start shooting down my spine and radiate throughout the entirety of my physical being like a bat signal of “you’re fucked” that my brain is conveying to my body. My heart feels like it’s wrapped in shrapnel and it’s trying to beat itself out. Thinking about my whole life crumbling to dust because of the decisions I’d made leading to this point? For what? For some God damn molecules? Time felt like it literally froze while all of these thoughts conjured themselves in my consciousness. Within the span of a second I turned around, ran down my staircase and toward my garage area savouring every last despairingly long breath I had as a free man. Frantically remembering the M I had in my pocket, in my manic state I did what every anxiety ridden, paranoid drug fuelled mongoloid would do at the sight of boys in blue, and I ate the fucking bag. They caught up pretty quickly since it’s only a short walk to my garage before they start asking me who I am, why I was running etc. Trying to painfully mask the fact that I had just dry swallowed 400 mg’s of mandy including the plastic under the guise of being ‘nervous bc police’ (Which wasn’t entirely false), I explained to them that I lived there and I had just forgotten something in my car and was going to grab it. They keep a close eye on me and verify my details before they explain that there had been a massive incident a street away from me and the perpetrator was last seen hopping the fence to my complex. They were asking neighbours incase there were any witnesses. The baggie had torn when I chewed it all up in my mouth and they weren’t capped, straight crystal form. I spent around half an hour talking to police and by the time I got upstairs I was already out of my fucking mind high. Vomiting was futile at this point. I kept getting higher after several attempts to puke so I decided to ride it out considering I wanted so badly to roll for the weekend anyways and this was my form of ‘punishment’ unto myself. I spend the next 5 hours literally, and I mean literally, uncontrollably orgasming and screaming at the softness of the blankets I human burrito’d myself in while listening to music, riding out the most intense roll of my fucking life. Eye wiggles up the wazoo, hallucinations so real they made schizophrenia seem like a vacay, jaw looking like I’d just been sucker punched, undertaker eyes, the whole 9 yards. But *GOD* the euphoria. The fucking euphoria. Bar my first time I don’t think I’d ever felt so content just being in a room with myself and my thoughts. Ended up being a very productive roll and worked through some really personal shit that had traumatised me in the past. Ironically enough helped me realise how anxious I truly am and how quick I am to jump to conclusions when shit perceivably hits the fan. It’s been almost a week now and it’s the first time I’ve had any kind of extensive comedown. I’ve done M semi regularly (every ~4 months with some exceptions) for the past few years now too. Mood still much noticeably lower than usual and my fucking vision just won’t seem to stop blurring itself out ever so slightly when I look around or read sometimes. Especially in one eye. Shit is fucking annoying. I’m thinking these symptoms are hopefully related to the amount I took and is acute and not a sign of me stroking out a part of my brain affecting my vision for good but only time and maybe an MRI will tell. I exercise frequently, meditate daily, rest well and eat as healthily as possible. I cannot even begin to fathom what some people feel and go through for their comedowns not doing all that other shit. So fuck me, right?

"I can now say I've lived both sides of the fence. For 35 years I was the picture of a 'square' having never touched any ""illicit"" drug aside from alcohol, caffeine and sugar; you know the ones the government can make money from. My career path put me in a position where drug tests were commonplace and the clearest head possible was essential to the high intensity of my profession; cyber intelligence & international law enforcement related work among other public activities and duties. There was no room to fuck up, I had to be the perfect picture of an abused poor black kid from a small town with a big IQ who never touched drugs and proved that the ""system"" was there to help kids like me become ""made men"" and was groomed by the best of the best who took pity on me. By 26 I had met Colin Powell among various world leaders and sat in command posts, scifs & situation rooms with every 3 & 4 letter agency you can imagine. My life was an open book, I was involved heavily in church working with children, had a charity under my belt and I was the ""success story"" that religious and civic organizations loved to parade around as ""inspirational"". However; I was also openly battling depression, suicidal ideation, self-harm and complex post traumatic stress disorder on and off for the majority of my early life alongside having been ""diagnosed"" as having a high functioning aspergers at some point in the adventure. The periods between symptomatic relapse and peace varied with life circumstances and I continued to give of myself to anyone who needed help as part of what I call my 'kamikaze mission'. I was not taking care of myself until I was in crisis; at which point I would crash from months or years of running on nothing but pure warrior will power, booze and adrenaline. I was proud of myself but hated myself at the same time. That guy in his 30s with a brand new porsche who worked 10-20 hours a week sometimes while traveling on one end of the spectrum and then didn't leave his house, eat or shower for 100+ hour hacking sprints fueled by porn & hookup breaks, whiskey and a desire to die ""for a cause"". Ugly cycle. But, I always said : hey, at least I've never touched drugs like you losers. See my success is due to me being ""clean"". I was a douchebag. I was arrogant. I hated myself. I did not know love. Naturally I was a wreck of an empty human to be in a relationship with. To any woman I EVER slept with or ""dated"" I am so incredibly sorry. I was nothing more than a movie character playing the role I thought I was here to perform .....and not really living. Then it happened. My dad, who I had met maybe 10 times in my life died. In prison at 70 years old. For raping an 11 year old girl. My family had hid the fact he was even alive from me for 8 years. Apparently I was present when he shot and killed my uncle in front of me as he was trying to molest me. The memory is there, but I don't go there. Ever. Following this my brother committed suicide. He never had a funeral. I fell in love with an equally as fucked girl from Hawaii, who was married and broke up with me - by having her friend text me on her birthday. So at 35 years old... I had endured 2 wives, 2 abortions without my consent, 1 miscarriage by a girlfriend who was a meth dealer and perhaps 90+ women under my belt. At this point I am realizing; I am a wreck. My life is a sham. I am better off dead. So at 35 I decided, I had lived an amazingly full life. Done shit people only dream of or see in movies. I'm good. I'm done. I give up. I planned on taking my life as a conscious and mindful resolution to my story. I told my estranged mom & family, friends, pastors, clients, everyone. My intention was not to be talked out of it, but to go out heroically I think. I thought there was something romantic and dramatic about doing it so thoughtfully and with discipline that would give my life & all the bullshit I had been through purpose. Deciding to die, was the best decision I ever made... I wrote my bucket list, had an insane amount of money available to me thanks to part ownership in a startup that made me a millionaire on paper ( funny how that works out later ) and was able to work anywhere in the world there was internet. Funny thing that I noticed about my bucket list.... drugs. I had NEVER even once smoked weed, not even a puff. I could count the number of cigarettes I had ever tried. No coke. No ecstasy despite spending years in the rave scene. I was a complete virgin. So I decided... hey, I'm gonna throw a big party and sip Nembutal cocktails for my last night on earth... might as well try this ""getting high"" thing before I knock off right? I booked a bunch of plane tickets all over the world and set a rule that I would only touch natural or relatively safe drugs & psychedelics. This was my last year on earth. Rock and roll. ------ Welcome to 'other side' ------ I spent the better part of a year in airports, hostels, deserts, couchsurfing, sleeping on the beach and hanging out with the wanderlusting hippy crowd. Nahko, Trevor Hall, Phish and Major Lazer became the soundtrack to my non-stop campaign to ""do all the things"". I had started doing lots of yoga and had made my way somehow to Canada, where fucking everything is legal. One wondrous afternoon a group of the sweetest yoga instructors I ever met offered me weed. Nobody could believe that I had never smoked weed, despite my long ass dreads and fairly chill demeanor. They just kept saying 'we love you' & 'you are very worthy of love'. I don't have any clue why they kept saying that, but I'm crying as I think and write it now. So like kids we went behind a tree in the woods and lit a joint. It was interesting but I really don't think I actually got ""high""; buzzed maybe but not high. I hung out with this group for a few days and continued to try ""feel"" whatever everyone else was feeling... this empathy, this love. And figured wow.... I am SO wound up I can't even get stoned. Fuck man. I failed at even trying drugs I said to myself. Luckily I was not a quitter. I hitchhiked to Burning Man 2015... and found my Home, my family.... and was completely at peace for the first time in my life. Still sober at this point. My camp decided it was time for me to ""experience"" and set out to hook me up with a steady diet of cannabis laced food & weed. NOW I had finally gotten stoned. Wonderfully opened up on the most beautiful canvas to be YOU at... Burning Man. I bloomed and enjoyed my own reflection. The day of the Burn I ran into some folks who offered me my first dab. Morning communion. Wow. I felt... Well.. I felt. Period. I was so connected with everyone & able to listen.... and I got it.... As I started telling my story a very sweet guy walks over to me and says ""It's time we take the veil off brother. Are you open to this? Are you ready to see the Real You?"" as he pulls out the largest vial of liquid LSD I had ever seen. Since I don't want to write a book on reddit... I will just say that this moment changed my life. A group of at least 15 people gathered around me in a circle and hugged me and said I am Love... I will BE Love... and that is all I ever was.... And I dropped... apparently a fairly large dose on top of having an crazy amount of cannabis in my system. Someone near me as I began to trip for the first time said I was beautiful and was crying like a newborn rolling in the dust of the Playa... :) . . . . . And for 12 hours, I saw... I was..... I AM. . . . . Since then I have tried HBWR, rivea and definitely gotten into the upper levels of stoned. Apparently I have a very strong tolerance for weed. In the past month I have taken MDMA twice following the MAPS protocol for PTSD assisted therapy... yes I know I should wait 4-6 weeks between rolling but I had a situation shortly after my first session that required intervention and the second roll actually helped tremendously. My CAPS score was 125 at its most severe, with a lifetime baseline of 113. The scale only goes to like 135 I think.... I was destined to become one of the 22 a day who commit suicide.... Following MDMA treatment this month.... My score is about 20. As in cured. Fucking CURED from PTSD. Drugs... wow. Having come from the ""other side"" I know to treat them all with respect. If you abuse any drug it will tell you ""NO, you have nothing to gain from me, I have nothing to teach you. I am an instrument, go and do the work you have been told to do inside yourself and don't come back."" So I am mostly focused on using specific substances as a therapeutic tools and have integrated it into some of my spiritual / meditation practice. But funny enough, I have now realized I don't even need the drugs to get to the state of bliss & love as much if at all anymore. They merely act as shortcuts and aides in this process. Today: I now have a beautiful 9 week old son, a stunning & supportive wife and and a life of real essence and truth. I am grateful and music sounds and FEELS so much more vibrant. I AM ALIVE :) I continue to smoke weed every few days and barely touch alcohol anymore if at all. I'm healthier & have a real sense of happiness in my life. I feel that the ""drugs"" actually opened me up to.... well Love. Loving myself. Not an image of myself. But the reality of myself. My darkness and my light. I've learned to love both equally. I would like to thank ""drugs"" for saving my life. When used with respect and care these substances can save the lives of people. So friends don't get too out of hand with self medicating. [ never planning on taking opiates, benzos, stims etc ] [ plant medicine & psychedelics only as self exploratory tools ] [ considering microdosing to see if that furthers my personal development ] As I finish this off I am now sitting in my new home in Vancouver, BC skimming Erowid & BL doing research on hippy flipping for a 3rd & hopefully final PTSD treatment session and looking for a therapist to walk with me over the next few weeks leading up to it; as I prepare to attack my abandonment issues in full force. Powerful medicine. Use with caution. I think I now know how to speak to my son about drugs now having been actively involved in the war on drugs and honestly... I plan on teaching him from a scientific, spiritual and logical viewpoint and allow him to make his own decision; and if he trusts me enough I would be honored to be his guide so he knows he's safe and how to respect these tools. Anyway, long ass post. Thank you. <3 I love you guys <3 [ stay off meth... there is nothing redeeming or beneficial about it. k ] EDIT: For reference, the CEO of my startup ousted me when he found out I was having a kid in January 2015. The event was a thinly veiled excuse covering up personal and internal power struggle issues but I am grateful for that experience because it put us in a highly challenging position and strengthened my personal resolve even further. I am back in now but for what it's worth but I lost access to ALL of that money. I was wise early on thought and luckily did not get myself into debt with my own company but well....; it was a ludicrous amount of funds which would have been nice to have when you come to find out you're having a son unexpectedly. I now realize that much of my self worth and identity had been wrapped up in this mirage of my job, money, cars and lifestyle. I was not a real person. I believe that psychedelics in particular helped ground me and alleviated hidden emotional and mental disorders that had plagued me for years. However when you ""look"" successful and you aren't a drug user; by society's norms you're a blazing success. It's such bullshit though because on the inside, you feel nothing and you are worse than dead. And no, I have not recovered financially but I am blessed to have very unique skills, experience and an unstoppable work ethic. Hoping to get it all back again in a few years and cash out this time. So keep us in your thoughts. After the ousting, I collected what money I had and we moved to Vancouver to be close to my wife's family and take care of my 'wee peanut' because I realized it's really people that make life worth living. So in the midst of this journey I lost all sense of stability and security as well. I want to acknowledge and in a way thank the ""pre-drug"" version of myself, because the discipline I had from years of not partaking is also what gave me the discipline to manage my usage and engage this endeavour with the respect and gravity it deserves.

"Today I have 9 months clean and sober from all mind-altering substances. 9 months ago, I could not go more than a few hours without some sort of drug or alcohol. It wasn't that I always wanted to be intoxicated, but more that it was so painful to be sober that I felt I had no other choice. I also spent a lot of time sleeping and I would fall asleep just dreading the moment that I would eventually wake up. I was spiritually dead inside. I really did not care if I lived or died. My thoughts were consumed by the desire to get high; I was a slave to drugs and alcohol. My life was in shambles. My relationships a mess. I hated myself. I could not function as a human being. Today, I have a sense of peace that I have never felt before in my entire life. I am content most of the time, and I am often happy. I am no longer afraid of my emotions. I can go to sleep at night with a light and free conscience, those feelings of guilt and dread are gone. I genuinely like and respect myself. I no longer look for external things and people to make me happy. I am understanding how to live life. I have spirituality that strengthens each day.

"guys, I want to start off by saying that Mr. Dyer was my 6th grade science teacher. he was my favorite guy at my school. he was always nice to me and i adored him. when i found out about this, it sickened and horrified me. i was crying. i immediately called the school and asked for them to leave my contact info to Mr. Dyer, as i want to support him. he is a musician, as am I and I want to play with him. Anyways the gist of the story is that graham dyer (his son) took some LSD and had a bad trip. police were called (by his friends assumedly) and they apparently got pissed off by how he was acting, so they put this kid in hell. they tasered him in his genital area, kept on tasering him repeatedly and didnt stop. he was banging his head all around the vehicle because of the severe pain he was in. it was so bad that the link i am about to show you, the fbi had to cut the audio from it because he was screaming in agony. can you just imagine how much hell this kid went through??? he was having a bad trip on LSD and this happened to him. i cannot even imagine the hell he went through. guys I want you to spread this, make this public, because this is beyond fucked up. fuck those police officers. i hope they rot in prison for the rest of their life. the dyer family had no idea how their son was treated by police until recently because of an fbi investigation was opened last year. rest in peace graham dyer.

"*disclaimer: this is not typical acid use. There are many concretely 'beneficial' effects from lower, more infrequent doses*

In 2014, I did on average 250ug of acid once a week for ten months, from January to October, or approximately 40 times. Doses typically ranged from 150ug-600ug (I assume; I never knew for sure how much I actually took). Subjective experiences ranged from slightly glowing colors to complete loss of any sense contact with the physical world around me (and a 10 minute orgasm at one point).

I had the ability to. I had savings. I lived in a house of accepting camgirls. Real life wasn't getting in the way.

The first thing people usually want to know is why? Nobody gets addicted to acid. It's unheard of. When people trip, they stay generally keep the fuck away from it for several months. It can be a very overwhelming experience, noncommunicable, and utterly alien.

I did it because I felt like I was *learning.* Every time I tripped I had the overwhelming sensation that the doors had opened and I was mainlining information from a direct source of truth. Every time I stopped tripping, it felt like those doors closed, and I forgot most of what I'd learned. But I wanted to remember.

So I kept doing it. Again and again, higher and higher doses. I needed to know. [I produced art.](https://aellagirl.com/artwork/) I played music. 

When we imagine frequent drug use, we imagine it as a form of escapism - that real life is too difficult, that we want to shut down for a time. 

Acid was exactly the opposite. It heightened senses, heightened what I was aware of in my own mind, let me explore the way my own thoughts formed. It took what I was and shoved my own face in it. [I couldn't look away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/3wbb3o/drew_this_coming_down_from_400ug/) There were times of deliberately induced and absolutely excruciating emotional pain, to which nothing in my regular life has ever come close. I did it on purpose. I needed to know.

It is very difficult to talk about the ""things you learn"" while tripping, because it occurs while in such a deeply altered state that language ceases to apply. It really is more about a *way of looking* - a very specific type of engaging in experience. ""Thinking about the experience"" defeats the point, because thinking about it is not the same thing as ""having it"". Applying words to the experience is misleading by nature. It is the concept in math where defining a thing gives it an outside and an inside, and thus you can never define the thing that is ""always outside"" - in giving it a term, in identifying it with boundaries, it is no longer what you are trying to say. The Tao that can be named is not the Tao. It is the unspoken, the Mu.

As time went on, I stopped viewing myself as a being separate from the universe. Sensations became interesting to watch, not motivating. I entered such a permanent state of utter peace and contentment that I stopped wanting anything at all. And by the end of it, I barely got out of bed, barely ate. I had stopped working almost entirely and was living off slowly depleting savings. Why would I work? Why would I do anything? I was.... not happy, not sad, I simply *was.* I was free of desire. I did not fear death. 

And, ten months in, I realized that's what I was looking at - *death.* I would compulsively whisper ""I am dead"" under my breath throughout the day. I was an empty vessel. And I realized, that if I kept doing acid, I probably *would* die, out of sheer apathy.

I wasn't terribly worried - but I had to make a decision. Did I want to continue down this path, knowing the end was oblivion? Or did I want to close the doors and return to the world of the living?

I chose the latter - not due to any compulsion or survival instinct (at least not subjectively) - but because I casually figured living would be more interesting. 

The journey back was almost as strange and beautiful as the journey in. As my motivations slowly began returning, I found all I wanted was to forget. Whereas before I was trying to immerse myself in the knowing, now I was constantly attempting to shut eyes that were permanently pried open. No matter where I turned, the knowledge had been seared into my brain. It was like that feeling you get when you watch a movie and are suddenly aware that, just out of the frame, there are camera crews standing around the actors, and you stop buying into the story because all you see is the movie set. 

I just wanted to pretend this was all real. I wanted to feel invested in myself. I wanted to feel upset, insecure, proud, happy, anxiety, anything. I wanted to stop knowing. [Here is a poem I wrote during that time period](https://aellagirl.tumblr.com/post/148554414581/11515) *lots of people have been making fun of this poem. I am feeling insecure and want to take it down, but instead am alleviating my worry about what you think of me with a disclaimer that it was personal and came from my journal, so don't have high expectations.*

Before I chose life, I didn't mind the deep nothingness I had sunk into - but after the choice was made, it became... not uncomfortable, but strange. I felt like I had abandoned an old lover, like this constant twinge of pain, like a splinter in my throat I couldn't dislodge. I thought constantly about tripping again and being reunited. I did acid in my dreams. 

Over time, almost without me realizing it, the eye slowly eased shut, like going to sleep. I started to find myself caught up in moments of investment. I started to feel insecure again, annoyed. And it was shitty and *amazing.*

It took about another ten months for me to return to roughly where I'd been when I started. 

I'm mostly normal now, with only a few remnants. Sometimes certain types of conversations will trigger it, where I'm sitting there and suddenly the eye of the universe has turned on me and I am melting away. It is very intense. I don't mind, though. That's a fundamental part of the feeling, really - that I don't mind when it's happening. 

I feel like I've pulled the wool over my own eyes. I've bought into this world. It is profoundly comforting in a way so subconscious it's difficult to identify. It's as though at all times, behind my ears, there is a powerful belief whispering *it's okay*. When I get locked out of my apartment, when debt collectors call, when my mom tells me she found a lump in her breast - *it's okay.* I chose this. I am full, I am held. I am not afraid anymore, and when I am, it's because fear is interesting, because I have the *privilege* of feeling it.

My underlying motivation now is to convey this awareness to others (or feel as though I have). It seems like the most important thing, the only important thing. And so here I am.

**another edit** 

A lot of comments are saying ""it made you feel like you understood, but it was just tricking your brain.""

This is not implausible - a lot of people do acid and get utterly convinced of silly things. But I want to make two points.

One, that information gained from the use of drugs is not automatically invalid. If you have two brains, one which was structured for a lot of reflection and one that wasn't, and you fed the second brain a chemical that made it similar to the first brain, would the reflection it undergoes be invalid?

Two, that the ""feeling of knowledge"" is something we get every day, anyway. From school, from authority figures, from our own minds piecing things together. What separates ""acid knowledge"" from ""regular knowledge"" is that acid knowledge tends to be about things you can't prove or easily communicate. This puts it more in the same category as 'god' - maybe it's real, maybe it's not, but we have no way of accessing it. 

Really it's a few levels above 'god.' People frequently report psychedelics as one of the most meaningful events in their lives. It has been shown instrumental in treating anxiety, depression, and end-of-life fear. There *are* measurable benefits from the outside, it's just very hard to talk about subjective sensations.

For example - how would I describe a new color to you if you'd never seen it? I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried to talk about it. I might sound absolutely insane. You might call me delusional. But if you had seen it, you would know exactly what I was talking about.",Addicted
"I'm writing this so my love ones know what truly happened.

Today started like any Saturday. I wake up, shake off my imposing existential dread, make a pot of coffee, and rip a couple of dabs with my housemates. 

My friend, we will call him Michael (his name is really Michael)
hands me the silicon rig. 

""Yo Jahbriel, wanna rip this dab?""

Before i could answer, the rig is in my hands and I'm ripping said dab.

I exhale, instantly thinking to myself that I could've held this dab a little longer than I did. God I'm a THC fiend.

in approximately 7.9 seconds I realize that I'm stoned out of my gourd. Naturally I dart to my kitchen and start cooking some beans and making filling for some tacos. This is where I make the most fatal of flaws. This was the first of wrong choices in what is presumptively the last day of my life. 

So I chop away at some veggies. I'm thinking some white onion (hell yeah), cherry tomatoes (please get in my mouth), minced garlic (you already know), black beans (please fuck my wife), and finally the x factor in this filling and the new bane of my existence: Habanero

Fast forward to me eating this taco and I'm just loving it. God, it was such a good taco. I finish, wash my plate, and head downstairs and hop on my laptop. While browsing the interwebs it doesn't take very much time to stumble onto this sub. I'm catching up on my daily dose of you all and find some story about a guy who fucked someones mom on prozac and some brew *note to self, is this the secret way of seducing milfs that I've been missing all along?

Anyway everyone in the comments was saying wow I'm jealous. I too was very jealous. I wanna fuck a milf.......

A light goes off in my head. 

NSFW 

So I head over to pornhub, I needed some me time.

I click on categories. Naturally, I swiftly click MILFS.

I procede to J O 

After several minutes of making some sweet love to myself I begin to notice that something was different and not in a pleasant way. I tried to brush it off but over time the feeling began to intensify. it was coming from my dick. oh no.

Suddenly I was transported to a different place. I was back in my kitchen watching myself cook those beans from earlier. I again could smell the liquid smoke I tossed in, and hear the sizzling of the oil. My past self was deveining and deseeding the habanero. I rewatched my technique. After handling the habaneros I realized the dire mistake that I had made. Past Jahbriel never washed his damn hands. 

Instantly I am sucked back into my own body, some light tears are rolling down my face, and I'm still beating my meat in my bed. Only now I know the severity of my situation and how I was brought here. 

I stop, and close my laptop and just lay down with my eyes closed.

My dick. Is fucking on fire right now. Every passing second is a never ending pain crescendo. I feel as though my dick is literally burning at the fucking stake and no matter what I do I cannot stop it. I took a shower, I rubbed it with lotion, I even dunked it in a glass of fucking milk, that's how desperate I am. I'm thinking about really chopping my dick off this is becoming less of a hyperbole as time goes on. This is one of the most painful sensations I have EVER felt.

Mom and Dad, I deserved this pain. Natural Selection has waved it's hands and done its course and clearly I am not fit for survival.

"I remember coming home from school one night , and when I walked in the house , about 10 syringes and a bag of meth were on the kitchen table with a note from my mom saying “Found this in your pants pocket in the bathroom :(“...I remember walking to my room and when I passed hers I heard her crying . 

I remember waking up to 50 missed called from my mom , and see her pull in the driveway and run as fast as she could through our yard , into the house , only to see me alive, and not dead from an overdose and let out a sigh of relief. 

I remember every time I would use the bathroom if I wasn’t out in 5 minutes she would come knock on the door and ask if I was okay...just to make sure I hadn’t overdosed yet.

I remember nights I would be dope sick , and in pain when I would wake up the next morning she would leave a 20 dollar bill on the table , because she didn’t like to see me in pain .

I remember sometimes when I would give her a hug , when she would turn away , I would see her eyes water up, because she hated to see me looking so rough .

I remember sometimes if I hadn’t been home in days she would message me and ask if I had ate anything that day , and would send me money for food. It was always 18 dollars . It was always 18 because she knew If she sent 20 I would withdraw it and spend it on dope .

I remember the first time she found out I was injecting heroin , and she held me and cried , saying “My baby is using needles.” 

I remember seeing her come home from work , with dark circles under her eyes from not sleeping the night before , worrying if I was okay all night 

I remember many times when I would come home , I would see the living room light turn off and her room light turn on when I was pulling in the driveway because she didn’t want to see how skinny I had gotten . 

I remember sometimes we would talk on the phone and after she hung up she would call right back because she forgot to say “I love you” ...just in case it was the last time she ever got to say it . 

I remember my brother told me every time the phone rang she would almost be in a panic, running to get it  , because she was wondering if that was the call saying I overdosed again .

I love my mama so much , and I’m so glad I get to call her Tomorow and tell her I’m 5 months clean off heroin and meth . I’m so glad I don’t keep her up at nights , wondering if I’m okay . I’m so grateful I have a mama who cares and loves me so much .

Anyway we go to his house and he was passed out so we woke him up and asked him if he wanted to smoke and he said yeah but he was fuuuuuuucked up.

"So i'm chillin in my room right? It's like 10 at night and I'm on my shitty laptop playing runescape trying to just figure out what the fuck I'm even doing with my life.

I was talkin to this girl on tinder and things were going pretty fast. As a pre-face to this: I had just moved to this city because my dumb-ass was trying to go back to school after being unwillingly cucked by my gf. She fucked my friends, I lost my mind, dumped her ass and moved. So I didn't know anyone except my roommate. Which never showered :( He smelled like cheetoes.

Well I match with some hunnies on tinder and none of them were really going anywhere except for this one girl. We'll call her Bri. So Bri and I talked for maybe 45 minutes, she was this 20 yr old who was doing some internship for an amusement park. Right off the bat she was wanting to hang out. This to me was pretty sketch because every girl on tinder ever is usually very skeptical about meeting up. You could match with 1000 girls but maybe only 4 would actually be down to meet up and most of the time it was in public.

I sent her a dick pic & my address - just like that her ass was in her car driving over to come see me. Bird up.

About 20 minutes go by and she texts me asking me if I wanna go sledding. I'm like bitch it's fucking 11 at night and it's the middle of summer what are you talking about? She's like LOL ok nevermind. I'm ???ing in my mind because now I'm thinkin this bitch might be crazy. Whatever though as long as I'm getting some version of laid we'll be aight.

Bri shows up. But with a friend...I'm like nigga you didn't mention anything about some ugly ass friend. Whatever though. I go outside to meet them. Now her car matched the description but when both of these hoes got out the car I verbally said ""oh sorry I thought my friend was here! I guess y'all drive the same car my bad""

They both started laughing and she was like...u/trustmeimdonaldtrump it's me Bri. I'm looking at her and i'm like...no you aren't. She's like yes I am! She reaches into her purse and pulls out her shitty iphone4s with our tinder conversation. I'm like oh...I guess it's dark out here my bad. At this point it's fucking awkward as shit. We're standing out in the parking lot not saying anything, she brought a friend when she never mentioned it in the first place, I didn't even tell my roommate what was going on & this girl looked like a completely different person. I'm not a noob at tinder - I know the runaround when it comes to checking to see if someone is legit or not so I was very surprised.

I'm like whatever dood come on lets go back to my crib. We start walking back and she's like are you okay?? You look super uncomfortable. I'm like nah nah I'm just shy around new people or whatever just trying to bullshit something so I could at least get these two lying sacks of shit back to my room to see what the deal is.

We get back to my room and I realize that she IS the same girl, she just gained like a hunnid pounds and dyed her hair.

Y I K E S

I offer the hoes some beer and I REALLY start contemplating what the fuck I'm even doing with my life. I was praying that whoever built the apartment's foundation did a good job because we are seriously putting it to the test tonight.

We get into my room and not even 5 minutes in both of these girls are asking to see ""that fat dick in person"".

????

First off - My dick is whatever but it's definitely not going to be shit in comparison to your pear shaped bodies. I mean if you're a normal sized human being it'll do the job. TBH my dick doesn't really get hard to sociopathic liars who couldn't even post a pic from this fucking century so I knew that wasn't happening.

Also do you realize how fucking crazy you have to be to walk into someone's home at 11 at night on a wednesday with an unmentioned, uninvited friend asking to see some dudes dick you've only known for 5 minutes?? Ok yeah you can judge me I sent a pic of my dick but whatever dude, it's snapchat, there's no face & and even if they screenshotted it I can deny till the cows come home (literally) that it's mine.

At this point i'm visibly uncomfortable. I'm thinking these girls are going to rob me at dick point or something because of how odd this situation is.

So after awkwardly trying to change the subject Bri basically spills the beans and says that they wanna do coke off my dick. ""Remember when I asked you if you wanted to go sledding?""

Oh shit. Damn..I mean these girls aren't hot by any means but they wanna do coke of my dick. You realize how much street cred this could possibly give me? I'm kinda cool but damn i'm not THAT cool you know?? Was I ever going to have this opportunity again?

""Shit ok if y'all want""

They were all excited and shit. I was fucking terrified. But I HAD to get my street cred. I could win every game of never have I ever with this shit.

I pull down my pants and her friend just grabs it and starts jerking me off. She was fucking eager. Bri is just sitting in the corner watching while she was grabbing the bag of coke out of her purse.

I'm having trouble getting hard at first but then Bri comes over and puts it in her mouth. Well as long as I don't make eye contact and pretend it's someone else this should work just fine. They start passing my dick back and forth to each other and I can't decide if this is the most awesome or worst thing that's ever happened to me.

I then lay back in the bed (her friend dries my dick off ) and they start putting this line on my dick. I don't know how much coke they had with them but I'd guess it was an 8-ball because I'd never seen a sack that fat before.

They took turns making the line, snorting it, and licking up the parts they couldn't get and repeating. Not gonna lie it was kinda tight and I swear I was getting a little coked out too but maybe it was like contact high? Not sure.

So you're probably wondering...how did that end?

Well. Bri went into the bathroom for like 15 minutes while I got my dick sucked by her friend. I came and they left. Bri felt bad because I didn't get any coke since they did it all... so she left me like 8 xanax pills. I'm like uh yeah that's a way better deal imo. She puts the pills on my desk and I walk them back out to their car.

-hugs me- we should do this again sometime!

uh yeah sure

A couple weeks later Bri called me in the middle of the night saying she was coming over. I was like uhh yeah please don't I have school tomorrow. I fall back asleep. 6 in the morning I get a knock on the door and it's Bri completely fucked up out of her mind screaming at me for not answering my phone. I slam the door on her and go back to sleep. My roommate was fucking pissed.

I never saw bri or her ugly friend again.

I ended up failing out and moving back home.

We still snapchat sometimes - she even lost weight.

So yeah. Basically... beware with tinder and maybe meet at a starbucks or something before giving out your private address.

"Last weekend I really overdid it with drugs and everything. I had off of work from Thursday to sunday, so obviously it's time to get fucked up. Thursday morning I dropped two tabs of acid and started smoking weed all day. That was fun as shit, but the acid lasted insanely long, like until noon on friday. This is where I make a very very bad decision. I wanted to party all weekend, so instead of sleeping like a normal person, I bought a fuckload of stimulants. Specifically 50 mg of meth, 80 mg of Adderall and 200mg of molly. I took the meth Friday at around 3.

Right after I took the meth I realized I had made a mistake, so to balance out the meth I chose to go to a party and drink a fucking lot. So I drank all night Friday night. Saturday rolls around and I am fucking gone, just about ready to drop, when I realize I have my cousin's *catholic school* grad party. Fuck. I decide to make a quick prayer to my lord and savior Addy Christ, then mouth breathe my way through this grad party. I wound up in a conversation with a nun. To give you guys an image of how I look, I was wearing the same clothes from Thursday morning, unshowered, unshaven, the only hygiene thing I had done was brushing my teeth, which I did out back by the dumpsters behind a CVS with a bottle of water and toothpaste that I had purchased inside, because no matter how fucked up I am, if I brush my teeth I'm succeeding at life. 

Anyways I'm chatting with this nun when my friend texts me that we're going to a concert tonight. OK. The grad party ends at six, and my friend picks me up and takes me to the venue, which I don't get a very good look at, but appears to be an abandoned warehouse. I'm waking around in a haze and drinks keep appearing in my hand, and my reflexes are great so I keep drinking them. I quickly lose my friend, then realize I'm gonna pass out, so to save myself I take AL 200mg of molly. The molly carries me through the concert, but afterwards I'm still in a haze and still can't find my friend. I run outside, see a van with the sliding door open and decide that I should get into it before I pass out, so I run and dive into this van, getting a huge gash on my forehead in the process. This finally knocks me out.

I come to Sunday night at 10:30 in an apartment that I do not recognized, with a splitting headache. I manage to stand up, very dizzy and stumble out into an unfamiliar kitchen. The owner of said kitchen sees me stumble, catches me and sits me down on his couch, then gets me a fuckload of gatorade. I touch my forehead and feel stitches. Confused, I ask my new friend where I got stitches, and he says he lives with a nursing student at a nearby university. I don't live in a college town. I ask this dude where I am and he says Madison Wisconsin. I live 3+ hours away from Madison. When I tell him this he says I'm welcome to crash at his place tonight, and as much as I hate to mooch of this guy, I pretty much have to. I thank him, then go back to sleep.

Monday morning I wake up at 8:30, my new buddy Scott hands me my freshly washed clothes, my phone, and my wallet. I call in sick to work, then I called my friend who left me at the concert and he comes to pick me up. I noted down Scott's address and immediately upon arriving home I mailed him a thank you note and a check for $200 because he basically saved my life, then I go to the hospital to discover that I have a concussion, which is great because I love testing my health insurance.

"I'm an avid chess player when sober, but playing on different substances is one of my favorite things to do. I don't know if anyone on r/drugs plays chess or even cares about this, but here I'm posting my experience playing while drunk, tripping, tweaking, or high.

*****

**Sober (Baseline)**

I play 10 | 0, classical, on lichess.org... Normal stuff. I usually try to close the position and break the opponent through positional play.

*Sober game:* https://en.lichess.org/VD3ZBkyw (I'm white)

**Alchohol (tipsy)**

Moves feel more natural, I can move without thinking too much but I still play accurately. I blast trance on the headphones and play 3 | 0 blitz, winning most games! In some respects, I feel that I play better when buzzed. *Drunk game:* https://en.lichess.org/g0pbpeCQ (I'm black)

**Alchohol (smashed)**

I do not give a single fuck when I move. I am wayyy too aggressive. I just do a tidal wave of pawns and exchange material whenever theres a chance. I pretty much lose 90% of my games when I'm super drunk.

**Adderall**

Hole. Eee. Shit. I turn in to a motherfucking chess computer on adderall. I can deeply analyze positions without sacrificing too much time. 10 | 0 on adderall and I win almost every game, playing at an 1800 level on chess.com. This is seriously a performance enhancing drug for chess.

**LSD (150 μg)**

*Did I change my board theme to rainbow hexagons? Why does my music sound like its coming out of my head, not my headphones? Oh, I'm playing chess! Yes, what a lovely game. A battle between two minds, there's truly nothing like it.* 

I notice that I am *very* good at spotting tactics playing on LSD. This is when you temporarily sacrifice material for a lethal attack, or a long term advantage in the game. Looking back on my games from LSD trips, I'm amazed at how innovatively I play. I make moves that sober me wouldn't never even consider... Overall, acid makes me a much more creative player. I play with aggression and vigor, creating threats with every move. LSD + Chess = amazing!

**Salvia**

No

**Shrooms (Golden teachers, 3g)**

*A human. There is a human I am playing against across the internet. It feels that our minds are linked over such a vast expanse of space and time. Oh, right, I need to move.*

I'm sorry, but I play like a retard on shrooms. Maybe it's the way psylocibin effects the brain, but I blunder every 5 moves. An interesting thing I noticed, however, is that I'm much more compassionate when playing on mushrooms. I congratulate my opponent on their win, and am impressed by their cleverness. But overall, LSD is the superior psychedelic for chess.

EDIT: *u/rory_spencer gave an amazing account of his experience with chess on shrooms in a reply to this thread. I've included an excerpt, but you can see the whole post by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/65lybk/chess_on_drugs/dgbvpxh/)!*

> Staring down at the tan and black coloured board I observed a desert, the dwindling number of pieces looked as dramatic as a standoff between great mountains, with cactuses and lizards squatting on boulders. The games that followed were suitably hallucinatory, I felt I was witnessing every possible permutation of warfare and conflict all on that board, clashing lines of muddy footsoldiers brawling in the dirt, tense Mexican standoffs, mages teasing one another from afar. All in glorious technicolour imax 3d. 

**Marijuana**

On weed, I play as I do when I'm sober, but I calculate positions much more slowly. I notice that I play a lot more conservatively, making sure that my defense is solid before making any attacking maneuvers. Overall, I play quite well when high.

**DXM**

I'm trying this tonight, it's my first time tripping on DXM and I'll be doing 300mg! Leave a comment to predict how you think I will play. I'll be sure to post links to my games tomorrow.

Hi r/drugs, I am on drug right now, I am on DXM. My legs feel switched and I can't walk and everything FUCKED. But holy fuck can I play chess, I think this game is buried inside my bones. I can play because I am chess.

"So, a few years back it was that blissful time right when the last semester of college was finally over and it was time for summer. For us, summer meant getting fucked up and making memories, preferably at the same time. 


My four friends (Liz, Patrick, Jamie, Sophie) and I decided we should definitely all go camping one night. We live in California and agreed that there is no better way to kick off the start of summer time than to drive up to Lake Tahoe to go camping and trip balls. All of us are at least a little into drugs, so you have five college stoners, some of us being psychedelic enthusiasts as well. All of us had tried acid before, except Sophie, who had before had only partaken in the sticky icky green, but was really interested in LSD.

It was early June and it was fucking beautiful out. The drive there was amazing, it was a clear and sunny day with a slight breeze. Once we finally arrived at our camp site, we spent a good half hour not even talking to each other and just admiring the view. It was around 3 P.M when we had set everything up. We had our tents, blankets, pillows, snacks, and other random shit we wanted to bring with us, and of course, some real good LSD that Jamie and I had saved over from a few months before. 

After sitting around talking about past acid experiences while smoking a few joints, we all agreed we were ready to drop. Sophie was a bit apprehensive at first, but then curiosity got the best of her and she was in. I don't remember exactly how much everyone took, but I know I had 300 mics. and everyone else had *at least* 180.  

We're all having an amazing time. There's just this big great synergy between all of us. We were euphoric, running around through the woods, exploring, yelling and laughing until our sides hurt, it was like being a little kid again. Everything is warping and wavy, the clouds are swirling and morphing and the trees are swaying back and forth in a beautiful psychedelic dance. It had started getting dark and we wandered off pretty far from our camp site, so we started heading back. Liz and I lit a fire and gathered a bunch of blankets near it so we could all sit around and just chill out.

Then Patrick says something pretty unexpected, ""Hey, this may sound odd, but my friend was telling me about having an orgy on LSD and---"" Liz cuts him off, ""Yes. I'm in."" These two are now grinning from ear to ear, their faces shifting around and looking just like oil painting. They stare at Jamie, Sophie, and I apprehensively waiting for our response. ""Why not,"" Jamie pipes in. I'm fucking hoping to God that Sophie agrees, because I had such a big crush on this girl. She laughs and kind of shrugs and agrees to join. I'm just staring at a flower growing in the ground, thinking *OhMyFuckingSweetJesusIsThisReallyHappening*. 

""/u/PsychedelicOrgy, you're the deciding vote. Are you down?"" Liz asks. I grin and say ""Fuck it, sure."" My friends cheer, I can feel the LSD fueled excitement coursing through my veins and in the atmosphere, but it was probably just my boner. We carelessly throw a bunch of blankets and pillows over the ground and honestly, I can't remember what happened after that. One minute we were sitting around the fire talking, then the next minute we're all naked and on top of each other.

You guys, you have no idea how fucking amazing this was. Think about the best sex you ever had and now multiply that by 100. There were fractals all around me. There were little outlines of fractals and crazy geometric patterns painted over my friends' skin. The euphoria was so intense, a few times we had to just stop and lie back for a few moments to catch our breath and calm down because we were laughing so hard. It felt like I was being tickled all over, but I never wanted it to end. It was like all our energy and emotions came together as one and I could just *feel* everyone's energy and it was just so magical. Everything was magnified and my heart was beating so fast I thought it was going to bounce out of my chest. Jamie later told me he started getting into weird thought loops the middle of it, so then without thinking he just yelled, ""this is not the time for an existential crisis, this is the time to FUCK.""

 I came so fucking much. I have NEVER cum that much as I had that night. It is just so indescribable. Everyone was morphing and their faces were almost swirling, the colors were just like a Van Gogh painting. The English language is so limited for me to put this experience into words. It was like a never ending climax of just absolute ecstasy. At one point, the jizz on Sophie back started changing into quickly shifting rainbow colors and I couldn't stop fucking laughing because it was so funny. I remember in my head I was like, ""Haha, it's like radioactive jizz,"" which only made me laugh way harder and like a maniac. Patrick asked me what the fuck was up and I just said ""this dick"" and then everyone started laughing uncontrollably again. 

It was beautiful. Just absolutely beautiful. My friends and I still refer to it as *that* night and when we trip together we always laugh about that experience. That night also made me realize I was in love with Sophie and believe it or not, we're now engaged! :)

Happy Bicycle Day!",NA
"When I was younger, I enjoyed occasionally tripping on LSD. I loved the state of mind it put me in. I loved the introspective thoughts, the deep realizations about life, the mind-blowing amount of detail that could be heard in music and the effect sound has on the mind, the insane visuals, etc. You guys know what I'm talking about.

For several years I never had a bad trip. I had some rough moments here and there but nothing I couldn't snap out of before the end of a trip. I was even in several scenarios that *could* have been trip ruining but always managed to get through those just fine somehow.

Then I had a really bad trip that's stuck with me ever since. I am someone who suffers from anxiety and I felt the worst fear imaginable during this trip. I saw things in people I had never seen before and it freaked me the hell out. I became hyper aware of people's nervous mannerisms and the behaviors people use to push that feeling away. Moments of social awkwardness lasted what felt like an eternity. Eye contact became physically painful. There's really so much more I can say but I think you get the point by now. 

It's been 4 years and I still get ""flashbacks"" as they are commonly described. I don't literally have a flashback but I will see something that reminds me of the extreme anxiety I felt while tripping and my mind will recall and reenter that state. It is something I deal with every day of my life and it makes my life feel like it's not worth living. There is no point to life if you are in a constant state of fear. Life is meant to be enjoyed with others but all I want is to be alone. I tried getting every type of help imaginable and nothing has ever worked. I believe I have done permanent damage to my consciousness. Unless there is a way for me to forget what happened that day, it will always be in my mind. As much as I love all the incredible moments I had on LSD, I'd take them all back if it meant I could feel the way I used to feel.(These part seemed ambiguous)

"To the young ones on here:

Your parents aren’t there to ruin your fun. They may be ignorant on drugs, thinking things like LSD will fry your brain or weed will lead to heroin use, but they only care because they love you. If you take a look around you the kids who can use any drugs they want without their parents caring will have a rough life. Smoking weed all day may seem like the best thing ever now but developing that habit during high school isn’t what you want. Your parents may be ignorant or overestimate the danger of drugs, but have some empathy.

You can sit your parents down and explain to them til you’re blue in the face that lsd isn’t dangerous, but good luck getting them to think their child should use it. You are their literal child, to your parents it seems like just the other day you were their little baby. If you are 14-17 you have a whole life to use drugs. Some drugs are amazing, safe when used correctly and even positive for mental health problems. That being said there’s a time and place for everything.

You’re going to experiment with your friends and that’s cool. When I was 16 my dad told me not to smoke again (got caught) until I was out of high school. I remember being so mad thinking I was an adult but really he was just looking out for me. I know you guys will use drugs anyway so please research and practice harm reduction, but when it comes to your ignorant parents just let it be. They are scared and love you, either lie and hide like a sociopath or hold off until you’re an adult with a more developed brain.

"So I've been seeing this girl for two months. It started off good. Then she started to get very possessive and clingy. She told me that I couldn't hang out with my female friends anymore, I told her I wouldn't be in relationship like that and she relented. Any time I'd go out drinking or smoking with my guy friends she'd text me the entire time, once I stopped responding she'd call me and if I didn't pick up she'd call my friends. She got her brother to call me once because she'd threatened to hurt herself (pretty sure its all talk but it still makes me nervous). I'd made up my mind after that I had to break up with her but obviously I had to be careful about it. 

We had a party at a mutual friends a week ago and I was going to wait until after that because I wanted to enjoy the party and I thought it might be awkward. Anyway at the party a friend offers me MDMA and like an idiot I took it (she didn't). Funny thing... suddenly all that possessiveness just meant she truly cared for me. I told her I loved her and she started crying saying how much she loved me and she was worried she had driven me away and how she ""knew"" I was her soulmate.

I know what all ya nasties are thinkin'. 

i just took some high power blotter acid and started tripping billies, wiggin out, shittin' rainbows, twilight zoning, ya know. Jumping off a picnic table or something and (imagining) jumping from an airplane and sky-dove. Kinda like Michael De Santa in GTA5. 

nah ladies and gentlemen, i live in a reasonably rural place with a local airport where a tandem skydive costs about 200 buckaroos, and acid costs $10 a tab.

Recently my best friend came home from school, he studied abroad. and we just watched fear and loathing in las vegas while smoking a joint and i suggested this, we were in such a fuck it impulsive decision mood and the vibes were resonating.

 so we bought tickets day of early morning, took our tab an hour prior and we were so excited aND ALSO PARANOID but we already paid 200 each so we had to do it, if we didn't pay i bet we wouldn't of. 

We meet the sky diver and the pilot while we were sporting raybans sunglasses on a cloudy day, and did a small verbal lesson as to what's going down (i jokingly said us, right fellas?) and i gotta say we kept our composure completely, using scipted small talk. 

Getting in the plane felt like a dream, my heart was racing like crazy like going up a huge roller coaster, you know youre safe but can't help the adrenaline to pump. Me and my friend constantly smiling and laughing like we some how beat the system. I had a vision that i was in a bomber plane going over no man's land, the roar of the engine. The ADRENALINE

When we jumped, well i didn't jump. i made the instructor jump us out and probably just thought i was getting some last minute jitters but in reality i was tripping balls and imagined i was in bioshock infinite as Booker DeWitt falling from Columbia to the inevitable flat farm lands below. 

10/10 one of the best memories of my youth ill always treasure 

Ps when i hit the ground i cartoonishly started kissing the grass like a movie character going onto ground after years at sea

The fall was obviously exhilarating, the whistle of the wind in my ears and yelling like a little kid it was so pure. Honestly the one thought i had for a while was huh, im in a little baby holder attached to man, hurdleing towards the earth at 122mph, that has done this hundreds of times. Laughing at me for my reaction, obviously a ""HAVIN' FUN YET???"" Was screamed in my ear, and i dorkishly yelled *OOOOOH YEEEEE* my throat was really dry from fear, alright?

Trips are always fun, but sometimes, like a dream. you remember it was good, magnificent really. But only small remneces and details, at least for me. You should always try to do something significant, emotionally or sitautionally! Buy the ticket, take the ride.

"So, I get to work this morning, it's 4/21 so of course I have been blazing like a motherfucking monster truck the whole day before. Everyone's just doing their thing, there's my wife talking on the phone, we work at the same company. I get into my office and all of the sudden the boss comes up to me and hands me this drug test, tells me I'm supposed to do the test. Well I start to freak out inside since I knew that I'll fail the test for sure. 

I didn't say anything to him, because I've read that you shouldn't say anything in those situations. I do the drug test, it's a pretty small establishment so I assume that everyone else had already done it. He told me that after I do it I should deliver it to him. After a couple hours he comes back into my office and asks me if I have a moment. He walks up to my desks and says ""We have your drug values back"". I start to get very nervous at this point, because I don't know what he has to say. ""Your amphetamine values seem a bit low"" he says, showing my test results. I knew this would happen, I shouldn't have skipped on amphetamine. ""You know you need to take amphetamine at least twice per week, that's the company policy."" He continues. I try to say something about forgetting to take my amphetamine, promising it will not happen again. Boss says ""We are really impressed on your cannabis results however, keep that up"". I thank him as he leaves, giving me a ""don't let this become a habit"". I feel relieved as I quickly rail a fat line and get back to work. I love working for myself.",Ambiguous
"Hi /r/drugs! 
I originally [posted](https://redd.it/6wf64o) this on /r/mdma, but a friend suggested me to share it here, that you guys might like it too!

Please share your thoughts! I will probably recreate this next year and would like to improve it if you have any advice :) 

Recently I had one of my most amazing rolls yet and I really want to share it.

A little background, I've been rolling for 4 - 5 years now. MDMA has been an amazing tool for me to grow internally and externally. I've introduced a lot of my friends to this marvelous substance, but a lot of them haven't tried since they're not comfortable taking drugs. That's good and I never insist.

Anyway, for my past birthday I organized a party. I rented a House in the woods and announced to all the friends I invited that the party was mdma themed. That if they were to go they had to take mdma. If they didn't want to, then we'd celebrate any other time. I invited most of my close friends expecting that most of them would say no, since most of them don't do drugs. Surprisingly all of them said YES. 

The house is 2 hours away from our city. I asked all of them to bring a big blanket, a big pillow, a lot of fruit and a funny outfit. We traveled in 5 cars, everyone brought nice things. When we arrived to [the house](http://imgur.com/a/kg2ts) we all were speechless, it's an AMAZING house, only surrounded by nature. Incredibly big and comfy. We arrived early, around 1pm.    Immediately after everyone was settled in I started ""creating"" our environment. After all my trips I've learned a couple of things that make rolling more comfortable and nice, so without telling anyone I just started crafting it. 

So, I moved all the furniture from the living room. I took everyone's blankets and pillows and created a huge floor bed. Literally I stacked 25 blankets in the center to create a huge (I think it was around 5x3 meters) comfy space. I changed all the lamps in the area to black lights (The ones that make colors shine in the dark). Then arranged Christmas lights all around the bed. I also brought neon body paint, brushes and 300 glowsticks. I brought a Home theater from home and arranged all the speakers around the big bed. A nice thing about the place is that we had absolutely no cellphone signal, so no one used their cellphones at all. I had a special playlist for the party, PM if you want it ;) it's really cool. 

After the space (Which we called PLURCAMA) was ready. We ate and went to a swimming pool which was in the garden of the house. When we were all there I made the announcement that I had a surprise. We were not only about to take mdma, Also lsd. Of course I told all of them that if they didn't want acid they wouldn't have to take it. But again, only 2 people refused, everyone took it. 

I gave half tab to everyone and the party started. I continued arranging things. Prepared a fireplace outside (Actually this was a friend's idea, whom in his trip was fascinated with fire). Made a camping tent outside (in case anyone would like to watch the stars). Also brought pois and a hula hoop. 

A lot of my friends were newbies to lsd too, so I was almost all the time checking out if they were having a good time. It was a really nice lsd trip (no one had taken the mdma yet). Half of them were around the tent watching the sunset. The other half were around the fire. It was really nice, everyone laughing, talking, some of us dancing. We took the lsd around 5.30 pm. At 8.30 I called each one of them to the fireplace. It was kind of a hard task, since everyone was really into whatever they were doing, but after 20 minutes everyone was already around the fire.

I gave everyone their mdma. I had it in parachute pills. In home i have a weighing machine so everyone had an accurate dose. I made 25 doses of 110 mg. When everyone had it on their hands, a friend of mine started shouting ""Give a speech! Give a speech"". And everyone followed. So I started talking. It was amazing, they were all paying really close attention. It was not easy since I was already tripping hard on lsd but still I think I did a good work. I told them something like this:

""I love all of you. This party, this experience, all of this is just a way of expressing my love. It's not easy to get together 25 people you love just to be with them. Believe me. But the fact that all of you came, despite your fears or prejudices is really valuable for me. This substance is really special, don't think I just like to get people drugged, this is a experience about connections, about learning, about sharing. Please enjoy it, take the best of it. I love you.""

Of course it's not literally the words I say, but it's kind of how I recall it. Everyone took their parachute and swallowed it. Then we all stood there and waited until the fire finished. When everyone got into the house. Their reaction was just... indescribable. Everything shined with black light, there were colors everywhere and the music was really absorbent. We all sat around the big bed and waited until the mdma started working.

A lot of friends didn't know what to expect. One of them came to me and told me he felt exactly equal as before. I just told them to give it time.

Then it happened. PFFFFFFFFFFFFFF I don't know how to describe it. One of my friends, a really shy girl. She was lying on the bed just hugging pillows. I came close to her and she told me: ""Why is life so beautiful? Why  is the music so perfect? Why didn't I Know i could love myself this much?"" and hugged me. I stood up and started dancing, the candyflipping feeling was really overwhelming. When [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fOHh5Q7Q1E) song came up, I exploded. I started dancing. Closed my eyes and just enjoyed the feeling of being overwhelmed with peace. When it finished and I checked my surrounding. I swear, I thought that is definitely how heaven looks like. Basically all people who have been important to me were there, loving each other, being happy, being at peace. Everyone was either hugging, dancing, smiling, laughing. UGHHHHHHHHHHHH. Writting this is giving me goosebumps. AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmnXGvXYpKg) one was really nice to roll with too.

I think I could write a book If I started describing all the experiences that happened to me that night. All the things my friends shared with me, the context of why those things ARE extremely important. It was... heaven, really.

As I was walking through the room, every 2 steps someone either called my name or came close to me. Asking me for hugs or telling me the importance I had in their life. Thanking me for the experience, asking me to dance. In a point everyone gave me a ""hooray"" and claimed my name. I don't want to sound selfish. I just want to share that I think I have never felt THAT much love towards me in my life. That feeling was just... God.

A lot of people didn't know each other. But everyone was connecting in really awesome ways. Shy people with geek people with ""cool"" people. There were no prejudice, no stereotypes. 

Of all the awesome experiences that happened to me that night. I'll share one of the most intense for me. 

One of the assistants is C. 
C has been one of my bests friends for around 8 years. He's been a milestone in my life. Without a doubt I could tell you I wouldn't be the person I am today without meeting him. A little more  context, I'm bisexual (mostly gay, I think you could say a 5 in Kinsey's scale). He is straight. You can guess the rest of the background. I had a strong crush on him. He was cool with it but nothing ever happened. (He is really straight). 

C and I were together and talking, and he started telling me the strong Impact i've had in his life. Then he started asking me, ""Why are you always single?! I don't understand!? Everyone in this party tells me you're full of magic but you're almost never with someone"". I explained to him that, what I expect of a relationship is progress. That most of people start to date you because you're cool or because you're good looking, but for me, my priority is to feel that that person makes me grow, makes me a better version of myself. And that's not easy to find. 

We kept talking about what we expect in a relationship and he told me ""I want to make an experiment, come with me"" We went out to the tent. It was... PFFFF, the stars were just.... as I told you there were no towns like in 100 km around that house. Without light pollutions the stars were just... ugh. When we were there. He was really hesitant. I told him he didn't have to do anything he didn't want to. He said, ""but i want to"" and kissed me. 

I just can't describe it. If you've ever been candyflipping and kissed someone you love maybe you can know how it felt. But this was, like, the peak of 8 years of relationship. A breaking point. It was like feeling the universe in a kiss. When we stopped kissing he looked up and said ""I now know, there is a god, look at the stars"". Pffff... as i write this I can feel my body overflowing with serotonin. 

We kissed again, and he told me he wanted to keep experimenting. We were all night holding hands, hugging and telling each other how important we were. (Just as a prologue, the experiment is over :c haha he realized he really is straight and kind of broke my heart a little bit, but I understand it).

A friend of mine cried because she said she couldn't believe it was possible to be that happy. The shy friend I wrote about in the beginning told me that she just learned how amazingly she loves herself and her life. A friend who is moving abroad forever told me he realized how to conquest the universe, through having children and sharing all your knowledge with them. Everything was perfect.

Another really nice detail, is that the house had this arch type structure with a quote. ""En un día claro, se ve hasta siempre"", which translate in something like: ""In a clean day, you can see until eternity"". Everything was mindblowing, everyone had A BLAST. 

The newbies, all of them were amazed. Most of them are still in their honeymoon with mdma, asking me when the next party is going to be. Of course I told them that next year :)

The next day we all woke up cuddling with each other, had a breakfast and no one had negative effects after it. They were playing cards and sharing their experience. Up until today, everyone is still haring how much they grew from the experience, how many internal walls they teared down, how many prejudices they broke, how much they learned to feel and love life.

I just... I expected something nice from giving mdma to 25 people in an isolated house in the woods. But I'd never expected it to be such a groundbreaking party. Everything, absolutely everything was perfect. The bonds between all of us is stronger than ever. People who had never met before are now extremely close friends. When chatting in the whatsapp group we have together, we all came to the conclusion that what that party made to us, is freed us. We all are free from so many things now. I've had at least 30 mdma experiences, but this is probably one the best. 

So yeah, I just wanted to share it. Document it somehow.
You guys (reddit community) are really awesome. I've learned a lot from you. Thanks for reading.

 
(As you can read, English is not my native language, so sorry for any mistake) 

I LOVE YOU ALL. 


Edit 28/08: Wow guys, thanks for all the nice messages and PM's! Reading other peoples experiences is always uplifting and it's what encouraged me to share mine. A lot of people has told me in this couple of hours you would like to be in an experience like this.  As I see it, these kind of experiences are possible and amazing when they happen, but they need someone with the will, motivation and knowledge to organize it. If you feel you would like to share something like this with your friends, it's up to you. If you have the possibility to have a positive impact in people's life, you really should :) 

If you want tips or help, I'll be glad to share more details of how this was organized. HUGS to all of you. 

Edit 2: Yes, I'm encouraging the experience sharing, not necessarily the drug consuming, but if you plan something with drugs involved IT IS REALLYIMPORTANT  firstly to inform yourself and share all the risks and the ways to do it correctly. You can find a lot of info about how to do things correctly here: https://rollsafe.org and https://tripsafe.org

Edit 3: You can also find really useful info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/13lp0b/mdma_neurotoxicity_part_1_metabolites/).

Erowid has been providing unbiased information about drugs for over 20 years, strongly resisting any attempts at censorship and taking strict measures to ensure utmost privacy for those wanting to learn.

We've seen many changes in policies and attitudes about drugs over the last 20 years, with the regulation of cannabis, increases in research on psychedelics, and revelations about the use of Ketamine for the treatment of depression.

Recreational markets have undergone huge changes too, with the hugely increased popularity of ""research chemicals"" followed by operation webtryp, and then a decade later, the huge amounts of methylone that made it into the mainstream markets as MDMA. It would have been hard to imagine the existence of darknet markets 20 years ago, let alone the shape that they now take.

Erowid also runs [ecstasydata.org](https://www.ecstasydata.org), the only publicly searchable database of drug analysis results, with results going back to 1996. The ecstasy market has changed a lot in that time, from everything being a round, crudely pressed pill like [this](https://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=924) to today, where ecstasy tablets may be comparable to professional pharmaceutical manufacturing quality (even if the ingredients may not be) like [this](https://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=5152). We have seen all kinds of things come through the lab, with the popularity of DXM in the early 2000s, the huge numbers of pills with piperazines in 2008-2010 and then the current situation where pills may contain dangerously high doses of nothing but MDMA.


Drug education isn't all that sexy and we don't get any government funding, but currently we have the most incredible funding opportunity that we've ever had in our 22 year history. An anonymous donor has set up [a fund to DOUBLE](https://erowid.org/donations/pineapple_drive.php) any donations received by 10th March, up to a total of $250,000.

We have been incredibly lucky to see so many supporters show themselves and are currently at 173k/250k [now at 183 of 250!] of the target. We have some incredible plans for securing the future of erowid and would hugely love the support of /r/drugs.

"I'm a 30ish year old woman, and I was no stranger to drugs, having done pressed E pills, MDMA, oxy, lsd, mushrooms and coke through the years. So when one of my friends brought over a small bag of Meth one day I was like ""why the fuck not"" and I did a few little lines. You guys know already how it makes you feel so I don't have to describe it.. but I'll tell you one thing... they say ""not even once"" for a damn good reason. 


Week one -  I just snorted small bumps here n there when i wanted to feel energetic and productive

Week two - snorted small lines 

Week three -  my nose hurt like a bastard and developed sores inside so I said fuckit and started to smoke it...

Month one - smoking was wayyyyyyy ""better"" so I started doing more.. I'd guess about two grams a week or so.

Month two - got fired from my job for missing too many shifts cos I enjoyed sitting at home and getting high more than anything. I graduated to about a half gram a day on the pipe.

Month three - full gram a day... sometimes more if people were over

Month 4 - received eviction notice.. ignored it until the last minute, went to court and got 60 days notice to gtfo. Didn't really care much because Meth. Figured that I would find a way to pay rent or something.. IDK what my thought process was.

Month 5 - Meth Meth Meth... don't remember much of anything else but I was starting to get really paranoid and I thought people were trying to break into my house all the time

Month 6 - water, heat and electricity shut off.. oh well, I had a woodstove and snow = water so fuck it.  Meth paranoia, Meth psychosis, meth Meth, meth.. prob 2g/day

Sheriff gives me the boot, and three days to remove all my belongings.. I have no family (not because Meth, but because they died when I was 17) and my ""friends"" are just as methed out as I was, so I had nowhere to bring my stuff, and no money or way to put it in storage so I lose everything that wouldn't fit in a suitcase.

Wander around freezing half to death for a couple weeks.. decide for the first time in my life to apply for welfare, but I was denied because I didn't have proper identification.

No money and all my friends ditched me because I wasn't useful anymore.
 No money = no Meth so I was really dopesick. Decided I was a total loser and I needed to clean my act up.

Hitchhiked about 500 miles away, allied for welfare again even though I still had no ID.. was accepted! 

Got a small room, still no Meth. Deleted names, numbers, and anyfuckinthing related to Meth..

Jonesjonesjones...... got a job. 
Thought about Meth every day. Workworkwork... 
thought about Meth every day
Got a half decent apartment
Thought about Meth every day.
Still working, drink on the weekends, smoke pot alot, still think about Meth every day but I am committed to never ever putting that goddamned drug in my body ever the fuck again. I was at a small party the other day and was offered some.. I politely said no while I watched other people smoke. I'm done. I'm literally crying as I type this but I did it! Though I still think of it, and I know I always will. 

NOT EVEN ONCE. SERIOUSLY.

I love being high and being with you. I love the way your hair feels on my hands. I love kissing your lips. I love feeling your warmth. You dont judge me. I know you try to help me but im an addict. Girl im a fuck up.Why do you love me?

No i dont have back pain. No i didnt get it from a doctor, i got it from a dealer. Dont be afraid when i take a handful, i cant take just one baby, its called drug abuse for a reason..

I dont know. ..Are you sure you want to get high with me? This shit aint like weed. Itll knock you back and put you on your feet. Leave you grinding your teeth. And sweatin when theres no heat. Girl im a fuck up dont follow my lead.

If you miss one more class their going to drop you from your nursing program. Im not one to judge but, your tolerance is building quick. Last night you took more than me. You stole from your parents that you cherish,  to get high. When you saw me you didnt kiss me, you ran towards my stash. Youre getting high everyday with me, girl im a fuck up , dont follow my lead.

Im sorry i have no cash. I cant support two habits. Only mine. Oxy is pricey. Relax stop screaming. Im sorry. Where are you going to go ? Your parents already kicked you out. Girl stay with me please..

This is the fourth time i have to pick you up from a guys house. And even though were not together anymore i still tuck you in my bed when youre sprung out. I make you eat so you can hide your ribs. I told you not to play with trains because they leave tracks. I watch you sleep and dry the sweat off your head. I hold you tight all night, because i know youll be gone  again as soon as theres light .

I love seeing words flow from your mouth. You use to have such a beautiful way of speaking. So intellectual, and from the heart. Deep conversations and ideas. Now im seeing foam flow from your mouth. Youve only been out of the hospital for three days and you want more? Girl please stop. I love you so much. I want you to be sober again. Youre taking too much. If you must get high, slow down, or else youll end up killing yourself. She said , ""its called drug abuse for a reason"".

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals. I hope the only reason why your using needles now is because you went back to school and became a nurse. I hope the only track marks you see are the ones on the road. I hope your hair grew its color, i hope your skins brighter. The last time i saw you i begged for you to come with me to rehab. I even went a month sober to influence you. I told you i hate looking at you like this. You told me then dont look. I told you i love you. You smiled and told me, ""boy im a fuck up dont follow my lead"".

"I've been addicted to heroin for 8 years. I was 15 the first time I used heroin. Two months later, weeks after my 16th birthday, I shot up for the first time. I'm an adult now, and all my friends are pieces of shit, everyone who I wish I was friends with are graduating school with fantastic degrees or did that years ago already and have good jobs with rewarding love in their lives. Meanwhile I sell hash and work at a gas station and every girlfriend I've had just wanted free shots, basically. I was supposed to be so much more, and I can be so much more. I haven't heard from my parents in 4 years because they care a lot more about their upcoming rugby player son rather than their heroin addict son - I can't really blame them.

That being said, at exactly 11:59:00 pm March 5th, 2018 I took my last shot. At the time I write this it is 1:59 am March 6th, 2018. All I have is cable television, a half pack of cigarettes and a quarter ounce of primo quality hashish. The longest time I've been off heroin after getting addicted to it has been about 2 days. I remember how it felt, and I'm prepared for it; no matter how bad I felt during those 2 days it can't possibly be as bad as I feel all the fucking time.

" id like to preface this with that i did not purposely feed my dog acid. This was an accident and it freaked me out.

I usually keep my tabs hidden but this morning my buddy asked if he could come by my place and buy a tab off of me so i cut one off my sheet and set it on my counter and moved on with my day.

About 45 minutes ago I was playing Dark Souls 3 and i let my dog come into my room so when she came in i wasnt really paying attention to what she was doing. After a little i saw her licking my counter and I paused my game to go scold her bc i assume she found some food when i remembered what i had out. I tried to open her mouth and pull the tab out before she swallowed it but it was too late.

So i freaked the fuck out for a little bit but after a couple google searches and reading some reddit stories i settled down and just wanna make sure she has a good trip. I havent dropped in a while but i decided to take a tab with her so she doesnt have to trip alone.

Probably gonna go for a walk in a second. Shes getting really anxious and pacing around the room a lot. Bringing treats and a backpack full of dog toys and shit. Do you guys think dogs like pink floyd? any reccomendations to give her a good trip? 

whelp wish me luck

Update 1: Walking to the park and shes off leash. She seems like shes having a great time. sniffing the fuck out of everything and has a big ass smile on her face. 

Update 2: Shes running around a lot. Shes got a lot of energy and will sometimes just chase invisible shit or start jumping on random spots in the grass. My tab is starting to kick in so i will update later whenever i decide to get back on reddit. thanks for all the support and help!

Update 3: Great night tbh. She had a blast. chased her tail a whole lot, nomed on my arm for a while, rolled in the grass, she even swam in the lake! she didnt really care for her treats and wasnt all that interested in her toys. Overall we both had an amazing time and shes asleep now. At one point while time was playimg from dark side of the moon i swear we were on the same level bc she was chilled the fuck out just staring at the lake with me. Thanks for all the love! You guys are awesome! Dont let this happen to you and hide your drugs!! will update tomorrow with how shes acting and doing

Final Update: Sorry i fell asleep late last night and just woke up. Puppers seems to be doing just fine! She was super excited to see me when i woke up as she always is. She seems a little bit more chilled out today than usual but otherwise she is completely normal. This was honestly a good bonding experience in the end and im glad it went well. But please dont feed your dog acid. this was terrifying for me and it could have gone terribly. Thank you to everyone who supported and gave me tips you guys are awesome.

"So a few days ago my mom found a ziploc bag with a few brownies inside and she suspected that I'd been taking marijuana edibles. I immediately hid the bag but she insisted she wanted to try one of the brownies to make sure they weren't pot-infused. In an attempt to cover it up, I went out and bought a package of regular brownies and replaced the pot brownies with regular brownies then offered her one. My mom is a super religious anti-drug advocate and I'm certain she's never been high or drunk in her life. Now after taking the regular brownie, she's going around pretending to be ""high"" based on her perception of what being high means. She's dancing really weirdly to music and she talks with this stupid baby voice and she keeps insisting she's high. What the fuck?????

"So I was catching up with psychedsubstance earlier and got the idea that smoking DMT would be a fun time tonight. Now, a few important notes of background, I'm taking a low dose of the antidepressant venlafaxine, so I didn't know how much the deems would affect me. I had also done a lot of MDMA the night before, which sorta worked in weird ways, and I had smoked two fat bowls of weed earlier in the day.

Anyway I totally eyeball a dose, at a guess it was maybe around 60mg, and take one huge toke which I hold in for as long as possible. I blow out the window of my bedroom but apparently this isn't good enough because the smell stinks out our entire house. I'm definitely feeling it, I go and lie down on a soft bed and fold inwards experiencing lots of wonky dimensions and flashing psychedelic colours morphing into pulsating fractals.

It is only a few minutes into the experience when my dad comes into my room asking about the smell. I sorta just look at him and shakily murmur a few words, not quite sure what I said. I'm seeing his face rippling with ever changing iridescent colours. I flop down and cuddle up to him for a bit, which he thinks is pretty weird but goes along with it, and then he leaves.

A few more minutes pass and then both my mum and my dad come in asking about the smell. I just look up at them and tell them plain and simple that I'm smoking DMT, it's an incredibly powerful hallucinogen, and I didn't mean to stink the house out. They both ask if I feel alright, I say yeah I'm fine, and then I tell them what the experience is like. I even ask if either of them want to do it, my mum looks quite tempted but in the end they pass and leave me to it.

They honestly were fine with it, they thought it was quite a funny situation, and said that as long as I was safe it was all cool. Maybe just go in the garden next time though.

I ride the rest of the trip out becoming one with the blankets and mattresses. I even go back to finish off the bowl and lightly trip a bit more.

"I was at a friends house yesterday, and our plan was to do some xanax and some subs. We popped 2 green monsters each, then railed a line of suboxone each. After about 2 hours, my friend fell asleep and wouldn't wake back up, so I decided to go into his kitchen to look for some munch material. I see his Grandma fumbling with something on the counter, and we strike up a conversation. After a few minutes of talking, she starts getting a little flirty. Normally, I would have very quickly declined because one, she's a granny, and two, she's my friends granny, but the bars made me give in. I started giving her compliments and flirting back, and when I told her I liked her dress, she invited me into her room to ""look at some of the other dresses."" I remember some foreplay happening, but i have no memory of intercourse at all.

Does this make me a bad person?

Also this wasn't my best friend or anything, just a dude I occasionally hang with

Also don't take xans and subs at the same time, really unhealthy.

"One night in the middle of winter my friends mom was out of town, so me and a group of 5 friends went to his house for a night of shrooms. None of our usual dealers were coming through, so we try a new number. Just our luck, he lives just down the road! We go get the shrooms, come back to the house, and eat up.

As we start coming up, everyone is having a great time except the host. I can tell he's starting to get into a thought loop, as he keeps saying things like ""Didn't you just say that?"" ""And that's where you come in"" (referring to the next person speaking) and my personal favorite ""That's the loop"". He somehow manages to rope someone else into his ""loop"" and they start talking about all these wild theories together.

Our one friend K is really good at calming people down, so she starts taking care of them while the other 3 of us go out to his shed to smoke. We had a vinyl player in there and we listened to Favorite Worst Nightmare by arctic monkeys, the visuals were like a neon disco, all the posters were super vibrant, it was fucking gorgeous! We sat in there and talked for probably half an hour then decided to head in.

As we enter the back door, it's utter chaos. The host and his companion are walking quickly about the house gathering random items and yelling about some shit, then they run out the front door with K following them. We ask her what the fuck is going on and she just says ""I'm fine, they're not, i'll take care of them, don't worry."" So we let them go out into the snowy night and have fun, and go on youtube on the hosts xbox.

When we hit search, the last search was ""Vsauce does the past exist"" and the last watched video was ""Did the past really happen?"" by Vsauce.

"Might get slaughtered for this but here we go.

As someone who used weed almost daily for a year, I finally decided to quit about 2 months ago. Tbh weed was just getting dull as hell and I just wasn't enjoying it anymore, it was just a crutch (maybe due to tolerance). 

After quitting, I was pretty determined not to smoke again, but I kept coming in and out of these bouts of almost depression-like states every week or so. The thing I did notice was that I was far more clear headed than I was before. I know it's a cliché but I feel like weed really made me lose motivation for a lot of things in hindsight, but at the time I DIDN'T REALISE. It's almost as if I was blind to the negative effects and only realised upon quitting. 

Now I feel like I can think a lot clearer about things, I am motivated to exercise, I get a lot more joy from things such as sports, games, and my sober music appreciation is at an all-time high. 

For all the people who I know will reply ""Oh yeah but some people can smoke all the time and still be motivated and get shit done"" well I did too, but maybe you should try quitting for a while and see if your standard of living improves.

"You are what you do, not what you think/ what you think you do. 

It’s easy to get caught up on your racing thoughts and some genius ideas that you had that you never really followed through on.

"So I smoked for a bit and then had the strongest munchies and was craving Chinese food. As I walked up to this joint that had two young Asians in their early 20s working behind the counter, I was super excited to order. I went straight to them and yelled "" I would like an order of chicken with vegetables"". They looked at me and said ""This is a Mexican place, we don't sell Chinese food here."" I didn't understand so I thought maybe I should try again, I walked out the place, read the name on the sign and it said ""Yummy taco"". But when I looked at the two young Asians working there, I reminded myself ""Oh yes they sell Chinese food."" SO I walked back in and asked for the same order, this time with ""please"".

"So, I recently went on a trip to Tokyo for two weeks, and I decided long ago that I wanted to bring some LSD. Now, I spent a lot of time worrying and researching ways to smuggle it into Japan. I know LSD is the easiest drug to smuggle which is why I was even considering this in the first place, but I was still nervous, considering you can get 10 years for like a tenth of a gram of weed there. 

Eventually I settled on a method. I just put a bunch of random garbage in my wallet (receipts, gum wrappers, etc) I put the tab in a gum wrapper and slid that particular one in between my cash. I got through all the security and customs just fine without even having to open my wallet anyway, but I was still mad nervous haha. Once I got to Japan I made sure to put on a long sleeve shirt to cover my tattoo just to ensure customs didn't pay any extra attention to me since Tat's aren't exactly socially accepted there just yet. 

So anyway, about a week into the the trip I decided it was time to trip, the weather was nice and I just wanted to do it. I dropped that tab at like 10 or 11 AM, it was a Goblins Den tab if that means anything to you.  The comeup was pretty hard at one point but it's nothing I can't handle as I've done up to 1000ug before, I hung out in the AirBnB with my friends while we all got ready to head out. Once I was nearing the peak and everyone was ready we set out to the Skytree. 

For those of you who aren't aware, The Skytree is the 2nd tallest building in the entire world, looking out over the largest city in the world. It was a bit of a long train ride from where we were staying but I held my cool on the train with no issues. We made it to the skytree and by this point I was tripping pretty fucking hard, I was relying on my friends to navigate and get me where I needed to go. We paid for our tickets and got into a crowded fucking elevator which wasn't very fun and we go to the top, and what a fucking view it was. A lot of people like to take psychedelics  in nature and feel a greater connection to the earth (myself included) but my god man, standing on that tower, looking out over the fucking MASSIVE urban jungle that is Tokyo is breathtaking, just insane. It really made me think about how much human beings have done and how far we've come from being hunter gatherers to taking control of our destiny as a species. I mean, it took us thousands of years to learn to fly, and then 66 years later we put a man on the fucking MOON. The MOON BITCH! After enjoying the view and having my mind blown, we went over to the skytree and I got some of the best goddamn soft serve ice cream I've ever had and continued to enjoy the view while eating. 


After all that, we left and headed back home, and I enjoyed the rest of my trip by walking around our cool little neighborhood listening to some music. Overall, a very great experience. It was very strange walking around high as shit seeing fuckin Japanese everywhere. What a cool looking language. ",Addicted
"I love to read stories, trip reports, people making stupid posts while high on anything, people wanting to chat with random strangers while being high and all of that stuff. It's just that some of you are real toxic. I'll show with examples by what I'm talking about.

**Example 1:**

Post: I took 2 tabs of LSD and I'm tripping hard I just wanted to say that this is life is great and have a good night

Comments: Dude, if you are on 2 tabs you wouldn't be able to type. When I tripped on 2 tabs I saw my 3rd eye growing out of my dick and was paralyzed for two weeks. You're probably some kid, using drugs isn't cool grow up. Cringe.

What's wrong here: Now, this isn't a quality post but the person just wants to spread some positive vibes, there's nothing wrong with that. If you can't know for certain that it's fake then don't comment at all. Even if it is fake then why should you comment, it's not like it's hurting anyone with that post. Only thing you're doing is making him feel bad and potentially ruining his trip. 

What you could comment: Have a nice trip :) 

**Example 2:**

Post: How to get heroin out of water?

Comments: Stop using heroin, it's shit and you'll kill yourself. Kill yourself for using it.

What's wrong here: You may think that that is harm reduction, but it's not. Your comment doesn't help anything other than induce frustration. The sub is designed to be an ALL DRUG subreddit, if you just smoke weed and drop acid etc and think you're on some sort of pedestal for it then go to /r/trees. 

What you could comment: Nothing if you don't know anything about heroin. 

**Example 3:**

Post: I hate alcohol. I love weed.

Comments: Yeah way to go! Alcohol sucks dick, it's so much more harmful, why can't the general public see this?? 

What's wrong here: The alcohol is bad circlejerk is pretty common in all drug subreddits, there is some truth behind it but most of the stuff I see about it is just wrong and ignorant. Same goes for the cigarettes is bad circlejerk. This is a ALL DRUG subreddit, we're not here to discriminate other drug users, legal or illegal. Harm reduction posts are very fine and encouraged, what I'm talking about is the circlejerk behind it without any actual content. 

What you could comment: I see your point, and I agree with you but there are also health benefits to using alcohol and it's a fun drug. / I also think alcohol is bad like other humans here and I do not enjoy it at all, glad we came to a human agreement about this subject humans discuss,

**Example 4.**

Post. I'm 15 and I have a question about drugs.

Comments: Omg this subreddit is being taken over by kids, ABANDON SHIP EVERYONE! I DONT WANT TO LIVE ON THIS GAY PLANET ANYMORE

What's wrong here: Kids are really passionate to learn new stuff, drugs being one of them for most. Please help them to make to best decisions so that they won't make mistakes that they regret or that could ruin their lives forever. Drugs aren't toys and should be taken seriously, so if you are a kid and have a question about some drug that you plan on taking PLEASE DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK. There are plenty of people who have good knowledge and expertise on these substances and taking the extra hour to see some responses could really make a difference between a great night and a bad one. One mistake I made as a kid was smoking weed and taking acid for the first time and I wish I would've made a post asking if it's a good combo for the first time. It's not and if it's your first time don't do it.

What you could comment: The answer to the question to the best of your abilities, also if you see wrong information given out please try to correct it.


Now, these are just my suggestions on how you should behave in this sub. Agree or don't. Also to posters, try not to make the most idiotic threads imaginable, but if you absolutely must then fine. I myself have done some of this stuff, I'm not perfect, but I'm making a conscious effort on reducing it and I hope you will too. This is a harm reduction subreddit. Almost everyone has some problems here with life, I wish that you all could be understanding about everyone's behavior even if it gets annoying or if there's incorrect information people could correct it and be civilized about it. Let's not forget that we are all just humans and all humans are stupid animals.

Peace.

**EDIT:** It's great to see everyone agreeing on this topic, one thing I would like to say is that if you see this type of behavior in this sub or anywhere else don't be afraid to speak out against it. It's a collective effort to make this sub as friendly as possible, I like to imagine this sub as being a safe place to ask about topics I can't google about or reading other people's experiences on certain drug combinations and sharing your mistakes without being judged.

**EDIT 2: Example 5:** (thanks /u/older_druggie )

Post/comments: I took a certain drug/combination, it worked in a certain way so I expect it will work same for everyone

What's wrong here: people assuming that because certain drugs and combinations at certain doses have affected them in a particular way that this must be so for everyone else. Each person will react in their own way to various substances based upon the dose, their tolerance, their setting and mindset, among many other things. Even Erowid.org states in several places something to the effect of how 5 people in the same set, the same setting, each taking the same dose of the same potency of a drug, may in fact have drastically different experiences. This is kind of similar to the Example 1, but example one talks about skepticism.

What to comment: Assume that your drug experiences were all unique and only give a blurry picture on what are the effects of the drug. There are countless of factors to be taken into account and you can never list them all in a comment, so take everyone's advice with a grain of salt.

Angry at myself for ever touching the shit, angry for the thousands of dollars funneled in and out of my hands while I failed to pay bills. 

  Maybe angry isn't the right word. I'm disappointed for sure.  I haven't talked to my mom in months. I chose to go pick up from my dealer instead of plans with my girlfriend last week. She got upset, I was very cold. More cold than I ever thought someone could be but I stole cash from her wallet and left, haven't talked to her since.

  Just before Christmas I frauded 3 banks for massive sig loans which I'm now being sued for. I've abandoned family, friends, even left my dog with my brother sometime last year because I was sick of taking care of him. I've lied to get more, I've stolen to get more, fuck I even pretended to be clean last summer to get money from my mom.

I take my headphones out and walk out of my room to greet them. I peak around the corner and see some dude in a shitty novelty Halloween mask and I'm like ""bro this can't be real""

I run back into my room in a blind frenzy and grab my machete. I feel fucking tribal and I'm seeing red. I walk into my living room and no sign of the guy so I go into my spare bedroom thinking that I'm just tripping balls. Granted the visuals were very intense and it was hard to see anything. Suddenly this guy jumped out of my closet with a baton and hit him as fast as I can right in the head and he goes down holding his head. 

I was about to swing at the dude again when he rips his mask off and starts scrambling away with blood fucking everywhere. He ran for my garage and I was too shocked to give chase. I noticed what I think was a piece of the guy's ear on my floor. I popped 30mgs of Valium to comedown and called the cops to report a break in. 

My house looked like a CSI episode or some shit for the next two hours. They got the dudes DNA and just checked if I was alright psychologically since I had no physical injuries. They left after awhile and I went to bed around 6:00 AM. One of the cops that was at my house hit up my line and told me about how they arrested the guy while he was driving. They found the mask, the baton, a few grams of black tar heroin and paraphernalia with crack residue in it as well as a stolen gun.

"I posted this on TIFU but it got removed so I’m moving it here.

Late Saturday night I was bored so I decided to do some coke to kill some time. Well one thing about coke is that when you do some you crave more. And for some reason, in my world of wonderful ideas, I thought I should try sniffing some flakka I had lying around back when I used to sell it. Same thing as coke right? 

I did a few lines (when  a single dose is supposed to be .1) and felt ecstatic. So ecstatic I decided to download Grindr and have as much gay sex as possible. I’ve never felt any attraction towards men in my life before last night, bear in mind. I ended up finding someone to hook up with and I took an uber to their apartment complex. My phone died as soon as I got there so I spent the next 15-20 minutes knocking on random doors that were close to what I could remember was the apartment number. I ended up walking to the nearest gas station (2 miles away) and charging my phone and then walking back. I found the guys place and proceeded to try to have sex with him. I say try because my dick was not working at all, and had no chance of working. So I ended up giving him head. Fun. After he was thoroughly freaked out and told me to go, I proceeded to find guy 2. 

I found guy 2 and took an uber to his house. Basically the same situation as guy 1. Finished that and went to guy 3, repeat. Except add extortion through (kinda) intimidation in the mix. I ended up bullying the guy out of $20. Thank god he didn’t call the cops, otherwise we wouldn’t have gotten to the final guy, guy 4. 

After getting rejected from multiple hotels for looking like the crackhead that I was, I found one and met guy 4. Guy 4 was a little different. He wanted me to humiliate him and tie him up. Never been into bondage but hey I guess on bath salts anything is possible. So ended up doing that for a little while. After unsuccessfully finding someone else for the night I decided to call it quits and head home.

I’m still uncoordinated and very scared I may have caused irreparable brain damage. This has been the worst two days of my life. 

TL:DR Snorted bath salts, went on a wacky gay adventure, possible brain damage.

"Watup. So, I get a call from a friend of mine to smoke some pot. That's not at all unusual. When he gets to my house, he tells me that he ran into our other homie, and that he was coming over too. No problem, all gravy. After smoking a bit, the second homie starts mentioning that he was having some problems and that he smoked some heroin for the first time the day before. He didn't seem at all proud of it. He said he had actually got fronted some more though on the way over. We kept talking, I tried talking with him about his issues and mentioned that I'd be willing to trade my half ounce of weed for his heroin. He seemed interested but still hesitant. We smoked a bit more (weed) talked a bit more and just chilled. When it came time to leave, he reaches into his stuff and hands me the heroin. Says I can keep the weed. I went inside the house and flushed his little ""baggy"", came out and gave him his weed. He seemed grateful before leaving. I don't know what he's gonna do but I'm gonna trust him. He's a good kid.

"This happened a couple hours ago, it was my high schools homecoming game and everyone was there. A lot of people come in baked or a little drunk which is really no big deal. 

Anyway I was with some friends and we sat down at a table by the field with another group of people at it. One of my friends knew one of the girls in the group and was friends with her but this girl was seriously fucked up. Like can't even walk, talk or count the amount of fingers your holding up fucked. 

My friend is trying to keep her from passing out so she's talking to her and telling her to count her fingers and look at her eyes and shit which she can't even do so after a minute or so she throws up all over my friend and passes out in a puddle of her own vomit so I'm like we need to move this girl so she doesn't throw up choke and die so we move her head to the side.

At this point I'm asking her friends what she took and they seemed fucked up as well and the only answers I got out of them were Alcohol and molly and other unspecified drugs. After hearing alcohol and molly I knew it was a bad combo so I said fuck this she needs help I'm calling 911. Her ""friends"" are all telling me not to call because she'll get in trouble but honestly wtf it's better than dying. 

Her friends leave as soon as I call and it just me and the group of my 3 other friends with this girl. The adults working there step in and we lay her on the ground and at this point the police and ambulance is here so we leave it to them. They're slapping her in the face and shaking her but she's not responding and I start to get worried cause it looks really bad. I think they started doing CPR but then stopped and carried her out into the ambulance.

I have no idea if she's ok but I'm sure if anything bad happened I'll hear about it on Monday. It just blows my mind how people are so irresponsible with their drug use like damn is it really that hard to not take too much and mix drugs that shouldn't be mixed? I did the right thing right?

"I’ve been addicted to opiates for about 6 years but for the past 3 years I was an IV heroin and meth addict and I got high everyday, and when I say everyday I mean **everyday**. (I also went to a methadone clinic) For the first year I had a good job and was able to afford it but I eventually lost my job which led me to doing all kinds of things to make money , and many I’m not proud of...I know I’m a shitty person for doing these things , and I know its wrong...I’m 5 months clean off heroin and meth so I no longer do this stuff, but I just want to tell my story on how I mostly supported my habit , some may find it interesting . 

Every so often my mom would give me a little money here and there, but definitely not enough to support the habit I had , so I had to come up with ways to make it myself . The most easiest way I made money, and what I did the most , was simply driving my best friend around . I dated this girl about 6 years ago , but we figured out we were better just as friends, and we both got strung out on drugs together . She was the first person I injected drugs with . I’m 21 and she’s 28.

As we got bad off in our addiction she became a prostitute...she lived with her father in the ghetto and had 2 kids . During the day from when they got out of school and until they went to bed around 9pm she was usually at home with them, but from 9pm
Until 7:00 am when they had to catch the bus, is when she worked . 

I would take her on outcalls all night long , and the deal was , we keep gas in the car , keep cigarettes, and the rest goes on heroin and we split it 50/50 . She didn’t do meth , just heroin . She charged 160$ an hour , 120 for a half hour , or 80 for a q.v. 95% of the calls were q.v’s. 

A q.v. stands for “quick view” and it basically means , just long enough to make the guy cum, so in most cases a q.v. only ranged from 5-15 minutes no longer. For us, it was the best deal because she could knock them out really fast , and we could get a half gram of heroin for 80$ and that was enough to start us out for the night . 

If we didn’t have dope you could talk her down to 60$ for a q.v. and if we were dopesick she would do it for 40$, but that was rare...it’s definitely happened a few times , but only if we were desperate . We always mixed all the heroin up together and split it between two syringes . She usually got anywhere from 3-10 calls a night . 3 would be a slow night and 6 would be an average night , and 10+ would be a good night. Most nights we would make around 200 being the lowest, 400-600 being normal, and 1000+ being a good night . We’ve made $2000 a few nights , but that was very rare . Luckily we never had any trouble with the police, did have *alot* of sketchy dealings though . 

I never went dope sick when I was rolling with her , we might of woke up dope sick , but it didnt stay that way for long . For some reason , people don’t do much during the day time , it would be pretty rare for her to go on a call during the day time , it was mostly always from 2am-5am. Some days she wouldn’t have good luck and we’d have to do other things .

There’s been many occasions where we would wake up sick , and have no money or anything . In those cases, I would drive my car from gas station to gas station and ask people for “gas money”. I was *very* good at talking to people , and selling my story...of course not everyone gives you money , but for the most part , I was always able to get what I needed . Out of all my friends , I was the best at doing this , because I’m pretty quick on my feet , I’m able to look people right in the eye and tell them a 100% bullshit story ,not stutter one word, and make them believe it...

I mostly sold the same story everytime...”I’m almost out of gas , left debit card at home , do you have 1 or 2 dollars I could have for gas , or even any change...I’m just trying to make it home, anything counts.” There’s small things you can do to ‘sell your story’ like look for change in your car while your talking to them, carry a gas jug etc. Depending on the person , the story would vary , but to make it short that’s it . I could always make 40$ in 2 hours max , but most of the time within 1 hour . That’s all we ever needed, was just 40.

If I didn’t feel like begging , (because it’s degrading), and somedays I just wasn’t up for it , I would go to Walmart . My golden rule was to never walk out with something you didn’t pay for...as long as you paid *something*.  There is a box of vitamins in Walmart that are 34$ for one box , and there is another kind that’s the same brand name for 4$. I would peal the barcode off of the 4$ box and place it over the top of the 34$ box barcode and go to the self checkout . Hell sometimes I would go to a regular checkout...I’ve never been caught doing this.

You can return *anything* to Walmart without a receipt, *but* you must have an ID...you can get a cash refund for any item under 40$ and anything over 40$ you will get a gift card . I would buy a box for 4$ and take it to another Walmart and return it for 32$ as long as somebody had their ID...you can only do it 3x a month, but I always got a friend or somebody to return it . 

If you have a receipt you don’t need an ID, so when I didn’t have an ID I would find a receipt for something around 30$ in the parking lot , go in and put a cheap barcode over the top of the items barcode, buy whatever it was for around 3$-5$ and return it with the receipt and get cash back . 

If I needed a bunch of money , I would go to the fishing pole section , and get a 100$ fishing pole , and peel the barcode off of a 15$ pole , and put it over the 100$ poles barcode . Return the pole at another Walmart and get a 100$ gift card , and then go to the Walmart gas pumps , and find somebody that would pay me cash to pump their gas for them . It’s kind of lengthy , but I could earn a couple hundred bucks a day doing that . 

It sounds goofy replacing the barcode , but it’s just *wayy* easier to get caught actually stealing something , than it is to “buy” it . I’ve done this hundreds of times and never have been caught once, but you can’t be obvious about it , and you have to be slick , or you will get caught.

We ate fast food everyday and 75% of the time we didn’t pay for it . I’d call and tell a restaurant I came last week and got such and such , and was missing one burger , and that I was coming for a replacement . I’d always tell them that I called back that same day , and talked to somebody and they wrote my name down...give them a fake name . You can only ask for one burger though...if you get greedy it won’t work.

The trick is , you have to be confident , and talk to them like it really happened...you can’t be sketchy , or iffy about it , you just have to be able to talk fast , and make them actually believe it...I was great at this...it would work 7/10 times...every time we did pay for food , we kept the receipt , so when we called and fed them the story , we could actually have a receipt and then it would *definitely* work. We survived off of this .

Of course we pawned all of our stuff of any value , and did a lot of middle manning , but these are just a few stories of some of our schemes that people don’t usually hear about .

I know all this is shady stuff , and I’m ashamed of it...and I know it’s wrong , but desperate times call for desperate measures...a hard drug addiction will make you do some terrible things , you’d never do in your right mind...there’s no need to comment on here and tell me I’m a piece of shit lowlife junkie , because I already know that...

I just figured a lot of people would be curious how a lot of junkies are able to make money on the streets for drugs without a job , and this is how a lot of them make it...a lot of people I know and hang around with do these same things ...most of my friends like robbing houses and stealing, and robbing people for drugs, but I never liked taking things from somebody...a multi-million dollar corporation? Yeah I don’t care , but as far as breaking in a persons house and taking all their stuff, and robbing people for their dope Nah...

I’ve been ripped off before , and I’ve worked a hard labor job for almost 4 years so I know how it is to work hard for something and then have it stolen from you , and it’s the worst feeling ....I don’t do shit like that...I could easily make more money by breaking in houses and cars and robbing people for dope , or “robbing tricks” which is what a lot of prostitutes do , but I just wasn’t okay with doing that...Hope y’all enjoy .

So I dropped out, barely job hunting because my motivation was still lacking. Months went by, and I get a call back from a fast food joint. It's not much, but it's something to call a start to a new chapter of my life. I start in an hour.

"Yes this isn't a standard r/drugs post but I've been on this sub for a year now and seen a fair amount of posts about kids getting caught with drugs by their parents 

I just read a post about a person who's dad is a cop and caught them with weed so now their dad doesn't know what to do and says he will enforce police dogs to make sure there child is out of trouble.

You gotta realize that your parents have seen a lot more than you have in their days, my dad is very anti drugs and hates me smoking weed. But thats because he grew up and saw alot of his friends go down dark roads of hard addiction so he doesn't want me to do that because he cares about me. I may be mad at him but I realize it's out of the good of his heart.

Y'all need to see that too, if your mad at ur parents try to see it from their perspective.

"So I was in my backyard, hangin out, chopping lines on an old cellphone when my neighbour peaks out his yard and asks what I'm up to (my neighbour is really friendly, fuckin rube) I couldn't think of an explanation for what I'm doing other than ""Oh, I'm just doing a little science experiment, you know that thing where you take the baking powder and put it in vinegar?"" that seemed to convince him that I was up to nothing but good. Unfortunately, he came in to his backyard with his kids, he said ""Don't mind if the kids watch do ya? *heheh*"", and he invited them to come in to my yard and go see it! Excellent! I told them to wait a moment while I went to go get the vinegar. I grabbed the dimebag of coke I had, shoved it in my pocket, and carefully brought the phone with freshly cut lines of coke on top of it inside. 

I dumped the coke on the table (in to one surprisingly perfect looking mega-line) and grabbed baking soda and chopped that in to a line (don't worry, I licked the phone right before this so no cocaine waste) and grabbed a bottle and put vinegar in to it.

Went back outside, performed the fun trick for the kids, it fizzed and they were pleased and my neighbours suspicions (if he had any) were put to rest. I went back inside, rolled a $5 bill and railed the fat line on my kitchen table and started writing this.

"Ok this is embarrassing and my friends use reddick so throwaway time is here

So last night, I'm on my computer, playing CimSity4, drinking my old bell IPA like every night when I get a snapchat from my meth dealer. 

Now, me and the soon to be ex hore love our meth but there is a difference between us 2. I can control my use, she can't hers. So usually I pick up and distribute small amounts to her at a time. 

I thought ""oh he's probably just high"" because he usually doesn't text me out of nowhere. He starts asking me weird questions like if I have plans (it was Tuesday at 11:30 pm) and he'll hook me up fat. 

Now, I've always known my dealer was a trip, but not this level of weird. His entire life is a front with him as a stay at home dad and he gives his kids valium. 

Anyway he asked me to ""cum over"" (yes exact quote) saying he will smoke me down. Me, being a meth addict and all was at his house in under 10 minutes even though it's a good 20 minute walk. Needless to say I was not expecting this at all. 

I get in the door and instantly 2 men grab me. One is my dealer. They tie me up with rope and start hitting me in the face with a lampshade (which only hurt my ego)

It is at this moment that I look up and see my girl friend hanging from the ceiling (no joke) laughing and watching. 

Now what I didn't tell you guys before is that I'm into pegging and my girl used to peg me a lot. I guess she thought I would be OK with a guys dick in my ass too?

But anyway, the guys are taking off their pants and I'm not only thinking their gonna kill me but I just started getting so confused and then my girlfriend told me the whole story right there. 

I guess she offered my dealer my butthole in exchange for $50 sack off crystal and her getting fucked too (not in the ass) 

It was then that I jumped up, kicked my dealers in the sack and ran back to my house with only underwear and shoes on, with my hands tied behind my back with literal rope.

I remind her about all the brands on my back that she asked me about on a previous date. I told her all those letters are initials for dead homies from the ""fast lane"". She trivializes it and I say whatever and the proceed to fuck her brains out.

We're laying bed after and I mention this new book I'm reading. She proceeds to tell me books are stupid, and boring, and that maybe I'm ""too smart for her"". I told her, you know what.. I definitely am. Byyyyeee Felicia!!!

Who the fuck doesn't like books? And who doesn't respect harm reduction? What a trip. Thank god the metaphorical sea has a lot of fish in it...

"So I'm in college and I don't smoke over the summer due to the rules at home. Today I came back and smoked with some friends at their house. I was at a solid 10 so I called an uber to pick me up. The driver was a sweet old white lady and she insisted I sat in the front with her so she could talk to me. I was cool with it and we went on our way.  When we were crossing the intersection on the main road, a car ran a read light full speed and crashed into us. It felt unreal. Like I saw the car coming in slow motion and I thought I was just high and it was gonna stop. Naw nigga. That car destroyed us. The airbags came out and smoke was filling the car quickly. I looked over and the driver was screaming and covered in blood. Her arm was split open. I got out of the car in shock and I realized there was too much smoke and the lady was still in he car so I ran over to help. She told me not to move her because she was in so much pain. I called 911 and the cops got there really fast and they were great. They deff knew I was stoned but they focused on what was more important, helping the woman to safety. My hand is a little sore but other than that I'm fine. The driver who hit us was an asshole frat looking motherfucker who only cared about himself.",Addiction-prone
"If you are horribly burned in a fire, you can take drugs to relieve the pain. If you shatter your spine, you can take drugs to relieve the pain. If you are addicted to drugs and your life has turned to utter and total shit, you can take drugs to relieve the pain.

And that's how the trap works. 

Imagine if the only cure for burn pain was fire. Imagine if the cure for back pain was whacking yourself in the spine with a hammer. The drug addict is caught in an analogous situation. The only fast, reliable remedy for the psychological pain of drug addiction is drugs. There are other cures (a notable one is *not* doing drugs), but they are all slower and less reliable.

Somehow, the lure of feeling better now overrides the hope of feeling better later. This is the basic mechanism of addiction. The behavior of an addict is perfectly logical in the short term and perfectly illogical in the long term. Because life exists in the long term, addiction is illogical overall. What is surprising how easily addiction can ensnare people who are perfectly intelligent and self-disciplined.

You can go to certain parts of any sizable city in America and watch drugs addicts totter around. Looking at their blighted faces, their filthy clothes, their total lack of self-regard, you would be forgiven for thinking that they lack self-discipline. How could you think otherwise? When a person can't be bothered to shower, much less get a proper job or just stop smoking crack for more than a few hours, what else could you call it but a lack of self-discipline?

Imagine the Nazi troops at Stalingrad, encircled by the Soviet troops, fighting against total annihilation. Would you look at these troops, these underslept, unshaven men in stinking unwashed clothes, and accuse them of lacking self-discipline? Would you say, ""Tut-tut, these Nazis are an undisciplined lot?"" Of course not. You would understand that their shabby state is not from a lack of self-discipline, but rather because they are concerned with other things. Dire things.

While there are several notable differences between Nazi soldiers and crack heads, the same principle is in effect for both. For both, there has been a terrible reordering of priorities. The showering, the clean clothes, the job, all of these become secondary to fast access to the drug. If showering and clean clothes got them fast access to the drug, they would walk around looking like a detergent commercial. You would never see whites so white.

But they don't need clean clothes. They don't need showers. They need drugs. The drugs are the solution to everything.

Highly self-disciplined people are actually quite vulnerable to drug addiction. It is because they believe that they need to control their feelings. They often seek to simply eliminate bad feelings, just as they seek to eliminate underperformance from every other area of their lives. The demon of addiction looks at their grand self-discipline and giggles with glee. It knows that it will be precisely this self-discipline that will bring them to heel. They will self-discipline themselves right into total obedience to the drug.

As an example, look at Prince and Michael Jackson. Were they self-disciplined? Definitely. The world has hardly seen such self-discipline. They were obsessive workaholics, devoted to their careers, and they propelled themselves to the very pinnacle of professional success. They both knew the dangers of drug addiction and fastidiously avoided drugs. Keep in mind, avoiding drugs in 1980s Hollywood must have been like avoiding water in a swimming pool at the bottom of the fucking ocean. Yet they managed to do it for a while because they had self-discipline.

Now they are both dead. They were both destroyed by drug addiction. In the end, self-discipline was not enough to save them. Why not? Because self-discipline is just a talent, an accomplishment. And like any other talent or accomplishment, it can be turned and made to serve the dark master.

What then is our defense against this menace? What is the answer?

"My name is Wade, I am 24 years old and I've been addicted to opiates for 8 years.

The first time I used was in highschool, I was 16 years old. I remember I drove to a friends house and was offered vicodin, I threw up everywhere and felt great,  after that it became my escape route. When my mom and dad passed away the next year at only 17, it became a way to cope and escape whatever emotions I had bottled up inside. By the time I was 18, I was working full time at Volkswagen and was taking 20-25 10mg hydrocodones daily, my addiction spiraled out of control and wasn't affordable. Eventually I was introduced to heroin, and was smoking $50 daily. By this time I had found my roommate dead on our couch with a needle in his arm, and had lost multiple other friends to the drug, but that didn't stop me. By the time I was 20 I had stopped working and was living in whatever car I owned. I was in and out of jail and got a felony at 22. At this time I was sick and tired of my addiction. I had lost everything 10x over from being in and out of jail. I wasn't your typical addict, I always had expensive cars and new clothes, always had money in my pocket, I once burned through $20,000 in just 3 months on the drugs. Getting high constantly, crashing new Audis was not a high point in my young life. I lived this life in the East Bay of California for 8 years, saw every county jail from Alameda county to Sacramento at least once. I've had 13 different vehicles impounded upon my arrest. I've witnessed the mean streets of Oakland to the rich addicts mansions of Danville and beyond. With a life of substance abuse comes the life of illegal activities. We used to pay crackheads to steal new late model BMW, Mercedes, anything foreign, and ship them to Saudi Arabia for our money. These were smart people doing big scale business deals with illegal vehicles, all just to feed our drug addictions. None of these people were bad people, just a group of young men who were led down a wrong path. The type of guy who might be transporting a stolen Lexus might pull off the side of the road when your cars broken down on I-5 to see if you need help. In 2015 I was arrested for 5 counts of felony transportation of stolen property, to and wit; 5 stripped Infinity G37's. After serving my time I was released from my prop 47 county jail prison term. I was now a felon on felony probation in Alameda County. This began the start of 3 years of being free, using drugs, getting stopped by police for small minor offenses, but being violated because I was on probation, I was in and out of county jail 17 times over those 3 years. Each time serving anywhere from 10 days, 30, 45, 90 to 6 months. Each time being released after losing everything and the stress pushing me back to the drugs. The only reason I am alive after all these years and so many addicts aren't is for two reasons, I am deathly afraid of needles, so I only smoke the stuff, and two, using has become about staying well and not sick, I can't remember the last time I was ""high"", and unfortunately its become my way of life and I can't remember how being sober for any length of time feels. I've ruined multiple close relationships with people I've loved because of my drug use because that's what comes first, them second. I've known and called myself openly a drug addict since my painkiller usage spiraled out of control in 2012. Hopefully I figure this life out and can fix the damage I've done so far.

I am 2 weeks clean.

I wish there was just help for people like him and people like us that didn’t have strings or punishment attached. I wish he could have been saved. Good bye.

"I recently saw this comment on a post and it made me sick, it broke my heart, and it made me feel shame. Not for the person who said it. But because once upon a time I felt exactly the same way. To me, drug addicts weren’t worth saving. They were a drain on society. They took money from my pocket that I could be using to buy shoes or a vacation or some other materialist bullshit. They were weak and death for them really was just natural selection. Survival of the fittest, right? 
But then I made a single mistake,  one lapse in judgement, and the course of my life was forever changed. And so was the way I see addicts. God humbled me in a way that I would not change, even if I could. For me to truly have empathy for the broken, I had to break. So I’m not angry at the person who made this comment. For anybody to truly understand the nightmare of addiction, you have to have been there. To truly understand the value of an addicts life, you have to be the parent of a child that has died from addiction. So I would rather they never know, than to have their understanding.

"Just wanted to share my experience with Suboxone maintanance and tapering. As the title says, I was on opiates (mainly heroin) for around 3 years. After meeting a wonderful, beautiful girl, I decided enough was enough and went to a doctor(outpatient) to start Suboxone maintanance. I think just taking subs for a few days to get off a multiple year habit is a bit naive, your likely to still want your DOC after, I mean it's only been a few days. So I did the opposite, and spent around 2 years going about this process, which included therapy, it was expensive but quite worth it now that I look back. I started at 8 mg (sub) a day in the beginning and worked my way down to just sections of a point, not a discernible amount by any means. Yes, going down was tough but i had Gabapentin in the beginning of the taper and both Gabapentin and Clonidine in the end. WHAT A COMBO FOR WITHDRAWAL, highly recommended. So, it's been 3 weeks since my very last Suboxone dose and I truly feel like myself again. I have all this energy that I haven't had in years. I feel sharp again, quick witted, and man my sex drive is through the fucking roof. While your on subs you feel like it's not really having any discernible effect on you, you feel... normal. BUT, once off them you realize that the suboxone was indeed dragging you down, keeping you a bit low, and severely emotionally distant. I'm full of love and emotion, so much so that I don't know what to do with it all. It's. Just. Great. I was really worried throughout this entire process that I'd never be the same person I was prior to my addiction, but 3 weeks in and I know that I'll be back. I'm not all the way there yet, but I couldn't feel better given the situation. 12 days ago I took a (required) UA with my doctor. There was no longer any suboxone in my system. I'm finally through this nightmare and out the other side to speak about it. Keep your heads up ladies and gents, there's always a light at the end of the tunnel and I just want all of you who think they've lost themselves through addiction to know that person in you, that amazing person, is still there, ready to come back out.

Now any time I see anything about addiction, like on TV or in the news, or even if I spot someone when I go out who I can tell (now that I know what I'm seeing) is an addict, it literally breaks my heart on the spot.  I can't take any of it lightly.  The weight of the devil on their backs is something I can see now, almost like a 6th sense.  When everyone else is percieving the situation with a passing glance, my heart is going out to these people who suffer this burden that nobody else seems to understand, and nobody can do anything about.

They told me the only thing worse than being an addict is being in love with one, but I wasn't prepared for how it would affect me after our relationship ended.  I just wanted to get that off my chest, and share it with any of you who might have dated people who didn't use, left them in the dust, and wondered if they really cared.

Lie to everyone else in the world.  Live a double life if you have to.  But if you have someone who loves you and will be there for you, then for God's sake, tell them the truth.  No matter what.

"I am reading RECOVERY (2017) by Russell Brand and it is a perfect adaptation of the 12 steps as they apply to the various manifestations of addiction. I think this is valuable because most 12 step programs address only one type of addiction, and it is very common for people with addiction issues to quickly turn to something else. This can result in less harm, but the underlying issues dont get adequately addressed, and people stay stuck in mal-adaptive habits for the rest of their lives.

Russell Brand takes a more holistic approach. He also provides some great alternatives for understanding the concept of a higher power.

His version of the twelve steps are minimalist, insightful and spot on (as follows):

Step 1: Are you a bit f--ked ?

Step 2: Could you not be f--ked ?

Step 3: Are you, on your own, going to unf--k yourself ?

Step 4: Write down all the things that are fucking you up or have ever fucked you up, and don't lie or leave anything out.

"As I sit here outside in the warm Carolina rains, chain smoking butt after butt, I can't help but realize a few things.

Not many people hear an addicts voice. Seems like our opinions and dispositions are like assholes, everyone has one and only few enjoy to hear them. Oftentimes I will read an addicts story after the fact, either from surviving family members or in a memoir written years later from a sober clean mind. But what about the addict overwhelmed in his own shit. Who dares to hear our plight? Who cares to believe it? I've been told "" you know an addict is lying if his lips are moving"". While an entertaining thought, does some truth lie deep in the depths of the bullshit? 

I'm not usually one for bullshit, it's quite pungent and stings the nostrils. I'll be the first to tell you that I love getting high. What's my drug of choice? What have you got? If I didn't love it, I wouldn't drag myself through the broken glass of this so called Iife i have created for myself. 

What once began as some after school fun has turned into an obsession to say the least. I am absolutely obsessed with the ritualistic nature of drug use. Finding the means, acquiring, fixing up. It's utterly infatuating. I'm so obsessed that I forget that using a needle to inject powder I bought on the street is not normal behavior. In fact it's quite abnormal and downright unsanitary.

Most days I'm just an empty shell of what I used to be. I can't function without at least a few illicit chemicals in my bloodstream. I can't think, I can't move, I lose all sense of functionality. And at this point in addiction, getting high becomes a full time job, a salaried position with 90+ hours a week to boot. Everything takes the backseat to this drive. I lose all love for everything I used to enjoy, everyone I used to love. My love for drugs has surpassed my own self love, which I find most paradoxical about the entire situation. Because isn't self love, my love for wanting to feel good about myself, what began this chaotic spiral?

Not only am I addicted to substances, I am addicted to chaos and misery. The unknown of the following day is the only thing that keeps me alive at points.

How a girl from a decent neighborhood wound up not only spending time in a county jail, but being shipped off to the penitentiary.  I feel like I am finally ready to tell my story.  My name is Megan, and I am addicted to Heroin.
    If even one person relates to my story or if it helps anyone I will feel like it was not all for nothing.  So here we go.  Fair warning: this is not a nice story.  It's gritty, dark, and sometimes upsetting.  However, there is a silver lining in every dark cloud so bare with me.
     I was about 5 years old when my mother told me my father was ""allergic"" to beer for the first time.  I have two older sisters who up until then fought to protect me from our awful truth that my father was an alcoholic, and an addict.  I would tell my friends and teachers elaborate tales of my father being in the army or that he worked at Disney Land when he would be absent for weeks at a time.  You never understand how someone could leave their children, ruin their own life for a drink or a substance.  I pray some of you never have to understand.
     He would have periods of sobriety throughout our lives.  Eviction notices or a missing t.v. came like a slap in the face when you realize those periods of sobriety were periods of deception.  They would turn out to be periods where we were blinded by hope that things would finally be ok.  He was fighting for his life and all we could do was watch, and keep loving him.
     I was 15 years old when I tried heroin for the first time.  I remember how cool I felt.  I wouldn't bother trying to cover my track marks in high school because I thought it made me a ""badass"".  My entire group of friends did dope, so it felt normal.  People also always needed me to get it for them and it made me feel important.  I have terrible anxiety and I had the choice to make it go away with one shot of that ""liquid gold"".
     One of my older sisters was also an addict, so when the day came that I woke up with what I thought was ""the flu"", she knew what was really happening.  She told me to do some dope and see if I felt better, and I did.  Within seconds of it pumping through my veins it was like I was a different person.  The goosebumps, the sweat, the knots of cramps in my stomach, all gone in one second.
     From then on I was in constant fear of running out of my medicine.  Yes, I called the killer drug that is heroin my medicine.  I stole from everyone I cared about.  I remember the look on my mothers face when she found out why her money or jewelry always came up missing.  ""I have done this too long with your father I will not go through this with you girls"".  Me and my sister tried to stay clean but heroin was now everywhere.  I had gotten almost every one of my friends hooked already, it was just too hard.
     Highschool ended with me going to jail for the first time.  Drug possession and shoplifting.  My mom paid the $2,500 bond and took me straight from county jail to rehab.  My first go at rehab was a complete joke.  I didn't try at all.  Heroin had become my best friend, and anything in the way of that friendship was nothing I wanted to hear about.
     I finally got discharged from probation unsuccessfully, but all I heard was that I was discharged.  I didn't care about the felony being stuck on my record.  It was the first, definitely not the last.  
     I got clean for the first time shortly after.  I met the love of my life, the one man who has stuck by my side through everything and got pregnant.  I had to go to back to jail while pregnant for old warrants i didnt know i had.  After a little over a month my mom had come up with the 5 grand to get me out.  I followed the rules until I had my son.  I never used while pregnant, thank you god.
     My son David was 6 months old when I relapsed, yet again.  I was 21 at the time.  My bond was forfeited when I never went back to court,  so my mom lost the money she put up to get me out.  I dove head first back into addiction.  I finally understood how my dad could leave us for a substance.  I sold my soul for heroin and did it with a smile on my face. 
     I had never been so depressed.  Instead of teaching my son to walk I was with girls who didn't care about me in run down hotels barely surviving. But hey, at least I had my heroin.  My sons father would beg me to come home.  He would come searching for me if he had the slightest idea where I was.
     I was on the run a little over 2 years until the cops finally got me.  I had almost 40 bags of dope on me when I got picked up for my warrant.  The beautiful thing about Chicago is that I didn't get charged for the bags because one of the cops was clearly an addict himself and pocketed them.
    My mom told me she couldn't pay another 5 grand so I sat.  I sat until illinois sentenced me to 1 year in the Department of Corrections.  I watched a woman hang herself my second week there.  I lived with women that killed children.  I lived with women that killed many people, sat across from them at breakfast.  The monsters you see on the news, I shared a toilet with.  
     I remember sitting the night before my out date just thanking god that I had an out date.  So many women will never leave that place.  Some don't deserve to ever leave.
     7 months of hell and I was released.  You would think being on parole and just enduring that type of madness would make you stay clean.  I got high after being out 5 days.  Again diving head first into the needle.  I went on a couple month long binges until one day I realised I'm too tired to continue on this path.
     My son got me clean this time around.  He is now 3 years old, and he can finally ask me to please stay home.  Please dont leave me again.   He said that to me and it's like I got slapped in the face with a memory of me begging my own father to do the same thing.  He is one thing I love more then heroin.  It just took me a long time to see that it was effecting him.  Heroin has a way of making you justify your actions.  You don't realize how bad it's gotten until you lose everything. 
    I am listed as ""absconder"" from parole on the IDOC inmate search, which means on the run.  I prayed that I could keep my promise of staying home but there was one more thing I had to do.  I had to turn myself in to my parole officer.  I was in her office begging for my life when she set the cup to pee in on the table.  She told me you pass this drug test, you go home.  If you fail, your going back to Logan Correctional Center.  Because of my child I passed that drug test today.  
     God gave me another chance.  Today my father has 6 years clean.  My older sister has 7 months.  I have 3 weeks and 2 days.  I am finally sleeping at night, and still have nightmares almost daily about relapsing.  The future is never certain, but just for today I am clean.  Thank you to my future husband, my parents, and most importantly my son for loving me until I could love myself. 
     God willing I will stay strong and win this fight.  If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction love them from a distance if you must, but please don't stop loving them.  I am always willing to talk or just listen if you have nobody.  Just muster up the strength to ask for help.

"I hope this helps someone else.

I've previously read that the difficulty with battling food addiction is that we HAVE to eat food. However, it wasn't until three months ago that everything sort of clicked for me after reading a random no name doctor's blog talking about food addiction: I don't have to eat carby (the bad kind), fatty, starchy, glorious, cheesy, delicious, sugary, food. It seems to be rare that people are addicted to healthy foods to the point that it becomes an issue.  I decided that If I wanted to get over my addiction, I absolutely couldn't have junk food anymore, and that I would treat this as seriously as  if I were trying to stop using cocaine. Example:  people who are trying to overcome addiction to drugs don't have the mindset of ""Okay. I'm just going to have a little bit today, and then not get anymore until next weekend!"" and then living the rest of their life this way.

In the past, I would try to limit eating fast food to once a week..... I'd then find some way to justify getting it every day after that, resulting in lost money, immense guilt, and pepto bismal chugging. I finally had to come to the realization that I'm addicted to most junk food, mostly fast food, and that I really can never eat it again. I could think of no pros for eating fast food multiple times daily. None. Just like there are no pros for doing meth.

I've been judged playfully (and not so playfully) by family, friends, and co workers. I feel that I make people uncomfortable by taking an honest look at my eating habits and being fairly open about not being able to eat certain foods/go out to dinner because of trying to get control of this. To them, it's comical. ""NO junk food? EVER? crazy!!""

I can handle going out to eat in a restaurant about once a month, and getting an appetizer with water. Any more than that, and I start to itch for more. I've been successful with redirecting some of my friends that always want to  have brunch/lunch/dinner/breakfast/second breakfast/dinner/supper when we hang out, and not so much with others. It's something I've learned to live with, and I'm not going to let FOMO keep me in the pre-diabetic range. The food also makes my stomach uncomfortable now; my body is starting to not know how to handle it

A seemingly famous example of all of this is Al Sharpton. Regardless of how you feel about his politics, the man lost 200+lbs by going completely cold turkey from junk food, and by going on a very low calorie diet with healthy foods. He  was poked fun of in the media for ""being too skinny"" when everyone first got a glimpse of him. He curtly told the media that ""They should've worried about him when he was morbidly obese""; he says that he has more energy and sleeps a lot better. I don't know if he was addicted to food, but the methods that he used to lose weight and his continued mannerisms lead me to believe that maybe he was, and that he knew he could never eat any of those foods again.  He says he doesn't miss them at all, and he didn't eat one piece of cake at his 60th birthday party.

These 90 days have been tough, but I can honestly say I'm making progress, and don't miss the way the foods made me feel. I have a loooooot of extra money, and this just shows me how much I was spending/wasting. I'm an abysmal cook, and that's another feat all together!

Not everyone is like me, and not everyone needs to completely give up junk food. But if you have issues with control, or if any of the above sounds like you, consider going cold turkey on whatever food(s) it is that's got you messed up.",NA
"I think that, at the end of the day, I just really badly want to be loved. I want to be loved so fucking badly, to be cared about, to be missed and thought about in my absence. The really fucked up thing is that I think somewhere inside me something, some little demon, believes that my eating disorder, my addiction, is the thing that loves me more than anything else in the world. That more than any person around me, more than any other activity or idea, it loves, cherishes, adores me. It certainly refuses to let me go, and begs me to come back every time I try to leave, wails at me to stay if ever I even think of moving on. It's always here for me, always waiting with arms outstretched, overjoyed to take me back into its endless embrace, to dance the nights and years away with me, always holding me close and softly cradling a head that sits atop my shoulders but becomes less and less mine the more dances we share. It is the most seductive, most toxic tango. It will consume me, wants to devour me. It will lay waste to all reality around me to keep me near, so overwhelming is its love. It needs me, and won't fail to remind me so if I appear ever to doubt or reject the thought. Yes, oh how it needs me -- and I need to be needed, can't resist being depended on, even if by the twisted darkness that will kill me. People will go on, will move past me, will eventually forget me if I disappear. My monster will die if I vanish from its presence. And boy is that significance seductive. The truth is that I would rather be destroyed than be insignificant.",Addicted
"Hi all, I'm almost 43 now. I started using heroin when I was 17...I continued for the next 23 years. I will hit 3 years clean (from everything) at the end of July. I'm done, don't plan on going back. That being said, my life is in more of a shambles now than at any time during my using history.
 Even though I was strung out, I was, for the most part, what we used to call a ""functional junkie""; I worked more than I was unemployed. I got sick in 2010 while living in NYC, working under the table to help out a friend with his business. It was a career, should have been a long term job (under the table was to be temporary). My sickness couldn't be diagnosed at the time w/o insurance. I was too ill to remain in NYC so had to move home. Fast forward to Jan 2014, living with my father in Ohio-I woke up paralyzed from the waist down on the left hand side of my body. Finally got the testing I needed: diagnosis MS. I also have Fibromyalgia, OA in my knees, central sleep apnea, MDD, and other various health issues. At first, I could still do some short work but by 2015, it was a no go.
 I applied for SSI and SSDI in Dec, 2015. Denial after denial. I had a lawyer. Final hearing in front of the ALJ was April 3rd, 2018. I just found out I was denied again. My Drs (and everyone else I've spoken to) are flabbergasted as to my being denied. The lawyer I had did NOTHING for me. 
My father, the greatest Dad I could have ever hoped for, passed away on Jan 10th, 2018. I lived with him and he was taking care of me financially, even though we lived check to check. His insurance was enough to pay for the funeral. 
 I was counting on the disability back pay to help with the bills that have accrued the last few months. My Drs we're absolutely positive I would be approved-my health has gotten so much worse the last two years.
 Now, my car is getting repoed, gas is shut off, electric getting shut off and hell, I'm losing my apartment next month anyway. Happy three years clean, you're now homeless...

"tldr; meth and sex addict doing the thing and living free and happy now, get with me

new to reddit, wanting to reach out to a wider community. i don't meet a lot of people successfully recovering from meth addiction, and i meet very few people recovering from meth addiction AND sex addiction like myself. I'm sure there are people out there doing it, because I'm doing it, so lets get together c:

I've been sober for over a year now. I'm gay, and when i found meth in the bathhouse it was perfect for what i wanted - crazy, destructive sex on crazy, destructive drugs with friendly welcoming people (just kidding they were all crazy and destructive, like me). i was 19.. that was seven years ago. i was diagnosed with hiv four years ago, tried to kill myself later that year.. i really didn't expect to live to see another year, let alone four. life is totally different for me today, its absolutely surreal. i have friends (i had none), a job that pays rent and bills (and is legal), I'm going to school and have so much joy in my life.

one reason I want to reach out is that recovering for meth can be extremely demoralizing. i think its something chemical about that drug, but i felt like i had lingering effects for 6months or more. i felt like i would never stop having cravings... i would get the taste of shooting up and it would last for ten, twenty, sometimes thirty minutes. it just.. gets better over time. and the literature on people with a fusion of meth and sex does not have very optimistic statistics on the possibility of recovering... but stastics don't apply to the individual, and I'm living proof of that. 

i want to reach out to those of y'all suffering out there, give whatever support and hope i can because it can be done. early recovery might be total hell, but there is a life of joy, freedom and ease on the other side of that hell. we just have to stick together and take it one day at a time.

"So, I'm a meth addict. I started in 1994. In 1999, I got clean for 13 years. I have 4 kids, 2 grandkids. I joined the Army. I went to war. I'm female. I was raped in a war zone by a fellow soldier. I died inside. 6 years have passed since then. I've been to rehab 5 times since then. 4 outpatient. 1 inpatient. That's on top of the 3 inpatient and 3 outpatient I did between 1994 and 1999. I'm a ""functional"" addict. I'm buying a home. I pay my bills. I was medically retired from the Army so I don't have to work. I have PTSD and severe depression. Meth gets me out of bed. I can clean my house and take care of things. I'm on meds, but they only marginally help. I don't want to commit suicide when I take my pills. That's about it. My oldest daughter is 21.

"My husband and I will have a year clean in January, (woohoo!!!) and today was a weird day.  We’ve both been fighting off a brutal cold for over two weeks. This cold will not let up, and just as we start to feel any improvement it takes back over and we’re dying again. It’s by far the most persistent cold I’ve ever had. We’re dead broke so we can’t afford over the counter medicine or anything so we’ve just been sucking it up. I just started a new job the same time the cold hit us and calling out isn’t an option. The last person who had my job was fired on day 4 for calling out, and I need this job, so going into work sick as a dog has been my life for weeks now. It’s been miserable. 

Thanksgiving was great, especially considering where I was last thanksgiving (family wasn’t speaking to us, I was either withdrawing or high, and we didn’t eat anything, which on thanksgiving was an especially painful reminder of how much of a fuck up I was.) Being clean for thanksgiving this year is truly a gift for us, cooking and eating and being a part of the family. 

As my mom and I were about to leave to check out some Black Friday sales, I heard my stepdad and my husband talking about how brutal this chest cold has been. I chimed in about how awful it is. My stepdad says the rest of my family had the same cold for about a month before he went to see his doctor. We got the cold right after babysitting for them, so we had a good idea that we caught it from them. He says the meds they gave him cleared it right up and offers us of his leftover antibiotics. 

(We have no insurance and are broke as hell. Of course it’s stupid to accept someone else’s antibiotics but we’re desperate to get well and have to go to work. Try to go easy on us for accepting them, we’re more than desperate to get back to our normal health.) 

I went shopping with my mom which was nice and obviously means a lot considering how broken our relationship was before I got clean. 

I got back to my parents house and my husband and I head home with our grocery bag with our stockpile of left overs and cold meds. Once we’re home and throwing the leftovers in the fridge, my husband asks if I want an antibiotic, I pass because my stomach is empty at this point and taking one on an empty stomach is a nightmare. We notice there’s another bottle in the bag. I grab it and immediately see that it has bold print on the side: CAUTION! OPIATE, MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS OR DIZZINESS. 

Guys, my stepdad sent us home with A FULL BOTTLE OF LEAN. Wtf. I’m like “babe!? did you know he sent this with us?!!?!? He says he asked my dad if any of it was narcotic when handed the bag and my stepdads response was “My doctor wouldn’t prescribe me anything like that. I took it one time and it did make me a little sleepy, be careful what time you take it.”  So then we both had a trigger moment. How easy would it be to play dumb and just take some, no big deal right? But we wised up and dumped it out. 

My parents are well aware that we are in recovery, and are usually supportive, as they have seen us at our worst. Occasionally they slip up and offer us wine or beer, and at one point my stepdad tried to convince my husband to drink because he’d “have a better time if he loosened up” and “he didn’t have to drive.” I’m proud of my husband for declining. To be fair, my stepdad had his cataracts replaced 20 years ago and they were only supposed to last him about 10, so his eyesight isn’t perfect. Its possible he didn’t notice the opiate label, but damn, he couldn’t have handed the bottle to my husband to check before tossing it in the bag??? I’m a little upset that we were in that position in the first place, but then I suppose that’s why you don’t accept any prescription meds from people.  

I can only imagine what would have transpired if probation had happened to stop by at that moment, both of us blissfully unaware that we had a full bottle of liquid drugs just sitting in a bag on our counter. There’s not an explanation for that that a probation officer would believe. Something tells me that “it’s not mine, I don’t know why that’s here” is something they hear a lot. To top it off, my stepdad is a criminal attorney, and likely would have been our first phone call from jail. “Hey dad, I’m calling from jail, it turns out that cold medicine we brought home happened to be a bottle of opiates.” 

I absolutely appreciate the irony that I would end up with accidental free drugs during a period of sobriety rather than the years and years I was using and would have actually been grateful for them. That’s amusing to me considering the odds. 

Just thought I would share this delightful thanksgiving story, I mean how often do you accidentally leave thanksgiving with a surprise bottle of lean right? 

So lesson learned, it’s better to have a chest cold than to make a stupid decision of accepting someone else’s prescriptions out of desperation to feel better. 

TLDR; Husband and I have had a bad cold for weeks, my stepdad tried to help and gave us antibiotics and a bottle of cough syrup that he didn’t know has opiates in it and we didn’t realize we had it until we were home. We dumped out the bottle.

"**Something I wrote that helped me make sense of some stuff I was going through. I hope it helps someone**

My name is Jerry, and I am an addict. 


Addiction in your early 20’s can take on a different meaning than most understand. No matter what your story is or how you got there, most of us figured out we were addicts when the consequences of our shitty decisions became too much to handle. The first time I ever sought help I did not remember the previous 14 hours, and I really had no desire to remember the next 14 hours. I had dedicated the year before that to Amy Winehouse-ing my way into the ground as hard and as fun as I could possibly afford in cocaine. I hated myself, I never felt loved thanks to a shitty upbringing, and it took a girl breaking up with my toxic ass to finally accept that I would not make it to my 21st birthday. I was hell bent on having as much fun as I possibly could before I left my legacy of two beautifully slit wrists in a bathtub and a suicide note that said “sorry for the mess, love you guys”. 


The gasoline on my proverbial self destructive fire was the party culture I was surrounded by. I had access to every drug I could ever want with the send of a text message. I had a bull shit job that paid for my rent and my habit, and I could even get fucked up there too! My life grew around my addiction, and as the time ticked towards my 21st birthday a violent-numbness categorized my daily life. 


I was surrounded by chaos, and the drugs made me love it. Violent numbness becomes a harsh reality for addicts. The more you do drugs, the more your life falls apart. The more your life falls apart, the more you do drugs. It becomes less about getting high to numb the pain of hating yourself, and more about surrendering to the lifestyle you created because this is the reality you fucking deserve. When you fuck up your life so bad that you think there is no way out other than the sweet release into eternal damnation (because if there is a hell, your spot is already heating up), you become addicted to making sure your life reflects what you deserve. You are so consumed with hating yourself that things that used to make you happy, like going outside or exercising, things that bring you joy are merely small distractions from the the fate you have assigned yourself. You learn to love your addiction as it learns to “love” you. Why would we need to love ourselves or seek the validation of an actual human being when drugs have all the benefits and so much less of the mess. Although clearly misguided, drugs gave us the power and validation love never could. For once in my life I felt supported in my goals of self destruction.

August 23rd 2017 will be two years since I last did drugs. I would tell you why I got sober, but it does not matter. Whatever your reason, whatever your why, whatever your how, we will always be addicts. Sober or not, no matter how far I ran from my problems the one thing that remained was addiction. Addiction has unwillingly beaten some of the hardest life lessons I have learned to date into my soul, and molded me into who I am today. I am proud of who I am, as I am sure many of you who have conquered some kind of addiction are. Feeling pride, however, does not always mean that we love ourselves. My rehabilitation process taught me ways to cope with being an addict in a college environment, which is great and I have been sober since. That being said, for myself and many addicts that I have spoken to, our former lives instill still have a way of coming back to haunt us. We know we can’t use illicit substances to get high anymore, so addiction can take on many forms. For me, love became my addiction.

I love women. I love their hair, their smell, the feeling of a woman’s body against my own. I love feeling something gentle when I have been so clearly not gentle with myself over the previous years. I love their ability to make me feel loved. The times I feel most loved are when a woman makes me feel loved, and when that disappears so does my ability to love myself. I love the chase. I know how that sounds, but I finally feel some control returning back into my life when I can charm a woman not to sleep with me, but to want to be with me. I am no different than any other man (sorry for the harsh reality ladies), but love takes on a different sense when you are an addict.


Women have this uncanny innate nurturing sense about them and it is wasted on the wicked. I have been around the block a few times, and I can tell you every female I have met worth spending the rest of my life with could smell a broken soul just by looking at your instagram profile. Women can sense it like a dog can sense a rainstorm coming. Some run the fuck away, but others will stick around because they believe that if they give themselves some part of the love that you lack, they might be able to fix you into the person you are unable to see. The more you tell them they will never find this person in you, the harder they try. And as time goes on you think to yourself “holy shit, she’s right”. The moment you realize she is right, you can feel the sweet addiction pull you back down to the reality you have created for yourself through years of violent numbness. You don’t deserve her or the version of yourself that she is making you painfully aware of that is not dead anymore. You killed that guy a long time ago. You have no desire to be with this woman because she loves a part of you that no longer exists, when in actuality you are just too afraid to be that guy again. So you push her away and cling on to the pain of hating yourself because that is all you have ever known. You can’t forgive yourself for the piece of shit that you once were because it would mean loving yourself, and you don’t have a fucking clue what that means anymore. This is the first type of women addicts attract.

The wallowing succumbs to our instincts, and like a dog with short term memory loss we trudge on looking for a leg to hump and a pat on the head. The second type of woman an addict will attract is essentially the human personification of cocaine. She’s beautiful, dark, and seems like a twisted short term fix to clearly a long term problem. Everything about her will seem perfect to you, and if you two wind up knocking boots it is a high better than any drug I have ever taken. The essence of her perfection will ironically be her fatal flaw, which is the fact that she could give less of a fuck about you or your dark and twisted past. She has no desire to fix you, date you, or even show a remote semblance of love in any facet. She is your drug. She will appear as your means to an end. You finally found the perfect girl who fits into like a puzzle piece (insert more cliches here). Sure she is pretty and interesting and probably has some demons of her own, but the true attraction of this girl lies in the fact that she could give a fuck about you. To anyone else, this is just a reality of college hookup culture. To an addict, this girl hates you like you deserve to be hated and you should ride it out until she just stops returning your texts. This girl does not love me, and the other ones were crazy for loving me, so I must be unlovable. 


The moral of the story is to anyone who has or is currently struggling with addiction, take it from a total stranger who has made a lot of fucked up mistakes in his time: you do not deserve what you are putting yourself through. If you are going to be addicted to anything, be addicted to happiness rather than the absence of it. Nothing you did in the past is worth destroying the future for, and I hope this helps make sense of something for someone.

"When I decided for my life that I was going to get clean I held up such high expectations on how my new life would play out. At first it was actually so easy to get off drugs and stay off, my mindset was in a great positive no more drugs place and besides the withdrawals I was powering threw in getting clean.

Months went by and the dust had settled in my life, depression started forcing its way in. It was absolutely horrible, and the places it took me too were soul crushing, hadn’t I been threw enough? On top of re-living traumatising memories and feeling isolated within my own mind, dropping out of uni, my mind was utter chaos.

Threw that I still kept of the stuff, joined a church, got my licence and re enrolled into university. Depression lifted and threw me into a manic episode (which i recently was diagnosed with, id been to mental health clinics before but i guess they never picked it up because i was under the influence.) Honestly, being manic was the best and worst thing that could have happened.. I got to feel a state of extreme mental elevation and energy levels. It felt like I was back to how I am supposed to be just with out drugs, which was even better because I had more money for other things. I felt like i was finally out of this prison I was swallowed up by, I could think about new big things and bad memories and sadness were completely bard from my thoughts. I couldn’t think and be saddened by anything!
I thought my brain had finally healed from all the trauma and the drugs and that my mind had found ME again. Only who I consider ME as was the me on drugs and It was for 7 years.

Anyway once I crashed and realised It was all mania and it isnt how I was going to feel for the rest of my life all I could think about was drugs. I wanted so badly to get back on it because I knew what I was missing in my life and it was ME.

I think about drugs all the time, what I would do when I was on it, what music I would listen too, what adventures I would have and how busy and full filled I would feel (chemically deluded). 
I’ve even tried educing a manic episode just so I can get that feeling back.
It’s like intense how much I miss and need drugs , I feel nothing with out some kind of chemical overload now.  
What keeps me from going back is my memories.

Sorry for the length if anyone reads this, things get built up and there isn’t anyone I can talk to who could understand the life of being an addict who is sober..

"We've been together almost 7 years. I've believed he was ""the one"" since our third date. So much has happened in our time together. He's the only dad my 8 year old son knows. He and I have a gorgeous tyrant of a 2 year old daughter.

Two months ago he tore me limb from limb when he told me he was going to care for his suicidal mother, but instead, went on a 2 week Ireland/London vacation with his ex. He lied the whole time he was there about where he was, til I found the itineraries. Then he lied about being with his ex til i found photos. Then he told me he was in a rehab in london, but he was just dosing at a methadone clinic there. Then he finally admitted to doing heroin for the last year. When he finally came home, he told me where to find his stash. To be very honest, I thought he was trying to hide the fact that he was a disgusting cheating bastard by distracting me with the heroin claim. In any case, for the 3 days after he returned home, he was a different man (obv). He had a conscience, he could talk to me, he was human. All things sorely lacking for the last 3 years since we moved to vegas.

It didnt last. I found text messages where he told a friend i stole $900 from him while he was out of country. Found texts where he made fun of me for my (admittedly vengeful and insane) reaction to finding out he was out of the country. Found texts of him scoring heroin and pills.

Found actual heroin in his toolbox on the 5th. took it with me. When he discovered its absence, he began ranting and raving about how I owed him money now.

Writing this out makes it all sound like pure insanity.

Anyway, I've been back and forth since he returned. Alternating between WHAT THE FUCK AM I STILL DOING HERE and OMG PLS DONT LEAVE ME. it's pathetic. While I vowed to do anything to save us, he just nodded impatiently and agreed with anything i said... then did nothing.

He denies EVERYTHING. His first impulse is to lie. Doesnt matter if it pertains to drugs or weather, he will always lie. Even if i am standing before him with his foils and melted straws in one hand and a glass dick in the other, he will swear up and down that he IS QUITTING, THIS IS WHAT QUITTING LOOKS LIKE. He tells me he loves me more than anything, tells me he cant live without me, then lies to me about his whereabouts.

last night he promised to come to bed at midnight. at 1:30 he was still playing on his computer. he went to the bathroom, i ran to the garage. Found a folded foil resting in a cloth in his toolbox6. of course he was furious. ""THAT'S SO OLD, ITS BEEN THERE FOREVER!!!""

told him to get out. he argued til 4am, then gave up and left. came back today, told me i never supported him. that when i found his drugs, I should have hugged him instead of being angry. for a solid 3 weeks he flinched away from my touch because ""quitting makes me antsy"". then discovered he was doing pills all along, he told me he never said that.

the denial drives me up the wall. ive doubted my own sanity. how could he make such absurd claims with such conviction. maybe i WAS wrong!

No. I went to my first Nar-anon on tuesday. cried through every reading. got every free pamphlet. cried through those. And then felt empowered. I stopped fearing his family woulf hate and blame me for his addiction if i left. If they hate me, so what. I know the kind of woman I have been, i have no doubt that I have been good.

he is finally gone. i dont have a vehicle, but i have a gorgeous Bianchi bike and my son has a decent huffy. we can get him to school. my daughter has a baby seat on my bike, on the bar. We made it to school and work on time today.

we're gonna be okay. Thankfully my entire world is not this man, I have a career and a business I built from the ground up. I've been offered a new opportunity for growth in a different field (on a hobby level, but STILL).

for the first time in months, I dont feel sad and useless and lost. I feel empowered, strong, and capable.

I hate that the sweetest, kindest, most loyal man I ever met turned out to be a lying, cheating scumbag. I hate that I spent so long trying to somehow reverse his addiction. I hate that I was a cliche.

But I dont hate the lesson, as painful as it was, because I grew from it. i believe that EVERYTHING happens for a reason, it is our responsibility to discover the lesson behind it.

Fingers crossed I can turn my hopeful positivity into careful budgeting so I can stay in our house with the kids",NA

"It took WAY longer than I had thought it would, just proof of how easy they are to get hooked on. I had been accumulating them while traveling through Asia where they’re easy to get. I also recently started smoking cigarettes again after quitting for two years (a really big achievement I was really proud of) and this has made me more aware of how easily we can fall off the wagon and how habit-forming my personality is. I have thrown away another pack of smokes today to try quitting again and included the benzos and all sleeping pills except for one to fly back home. I feel quite naked and alone now, had a beer to “help” and binged on food but it’s all just the same isn’t it? Gosh when did I become like this? I’m really hoping to start replacing these bad habits with exercise soon, it’s the only solution I know that makes me feel good. I hate being so self-destructive. Normally I post on the stop drinking sub but at this stage I almost feel like I still need the occasional beer to just make everything not seem completely dull. The risk with that is getting drunk and doing coke though. Argh sorry for the rant I’m just feeling confused and like my life is run by my addictions. I’m relatively functional too which makes it harder to take seriously and easy to talk myself into any kind of relapse 😒. Any tips or advice would be appreciated.",Ambiguous
"So I've been doing a lot of soul-searching, introspection, and research lately about addiction. I realize that I even once I stop drinking, I am still an addict and just keep trying to fill this ""void"" and feeling of emptiness with other fixes - food, porn, social media, YouTube videos, basically anything to distract me and keep me from the feeling of empty despair or discomfort. It seems like psychological addictions are a desperate attempt to avoid the feeling of discomfort.

My initial plan for ""getting over"" my addictions was to basically try and fill my life up with as many meaningful things as possible - better career, new hobbies, finding a significant other, meeting new people, and basically more positive things to fill up that emptiness inside. My life over the past few years has been extremely unfulfilling and I feel a deep sense of lack of purpose and social connection. I just graduated college and at a point in my life where I can pretty much choose my path and set up a new life for myself which is exciting, but also kind of overwhelming because I'm having a tough time deciding what to do next.

I guess my question is - do you think that filling your life up with an abundance of ""better"" activities, people, purpose, etc. is the solution to recovery? Or do you feel that the need to avoid discomfort and fill the void is the issue? I almost feel like I currently NEED to avoid discomfort and feeling empty and that is the root of the problem.

I would love to be situationally independent rather than just create the best situation for me to live in. Anyone have any experience with this?? I realize that isolating oneself too much and forcing yourself to feel empty for awhile might not be the best thing to do for the long run, but I'm just afraid that I'll always be chasing some type of dragon that might not be real..",NA

"Addiction is a hurricane in the home that you grew up in. It starts slow. You can still see the sun behind the clouds. It’s not raining. You’re ok. 

Category 1

Addiction is a toothache, at dinnertime. Chew carefully. Make small talk. Mention the weather in the next city. The food is still good.. You’re ok.

Addiction is the yearly flu, in the mid summer heat. Sweaty, turn on the A.C.. Sleep it off. You’re ok.

Addiction is a broken down car. It’s rusty, squeaky, rough and you’ll make time for the repairs. It starts raining while you drive. You made it to work. You’re still ok.

Category 2

Addiction is the missing person at your daughter's birthday. You’ll make it up to her. She says, It’s ok.

Addiction is late nights at work. No one worries. You’re ok.

Addiction is the monster under your kids' bunk bed. You know it’s in their heads. You tell them that. They look at you, ok.

Category 3

Addiction is an empty bank account on grocery day. Your mom comes by. You’re not hungry but she fills your fridge anyways. She mentions the weather. She asks, Are you ok?

Addiction is the 6 o'clock news. They comment on the rain. They warn about the wind. Fancy charts and graphs and patterns. Statistics. What a tragedy. You’re not them. You turn off the tv. Because… you’re still… ok.

Addiction is insomnia. Three AM on a Wednesday. Clock ticks incessantly. Tear it off the wall. Rain beating on the roof still. You’re OK.

Category 4

Addiction is the hand at your partner’s throat during an argument. Steady. Strong. But you let go. And she's ok. 

Addiction is a loved one leaving. They come back. You promise you’re ok.

Addiction is waking up for work sluggish, foggy, the floor is wet. You look up and can’t see the sun through the clouds and rain. The car doesn’t start. Your boss calls. You walk to work. You’re late. But it's ok.

Addiction is missing money. Misplaced trust. So much rain. One last chance, ok?

Addiction is the yearly flu, it hits you a bit harder, a bit more often. You leave work early, A.C. broke. You sleep on sweat-soaked sheets. The floor is still wet. Your mother calls, Are you coming for dinner? You sell the car. Didn’t work, anyway. It’s ok.

Category 5

Addiction is the eye of the storm. Rain. Wind. Debris. Your kids and partner knew it wasn’t safe anymore. They call and check in. You promise it'll pass. Your tooth falls out. 

Addiction is bounced bill payments. Water hitting your ankles. Where is the damn sun? You still have the flu. Your boss calls, We'll talk on Monday.  You sell the T.V.

Addiction is the flood in your home. The rain that won’t stop. The current that washed away your neighbours. Your family calls. Can’t shake this flu. Can’t stop shaking. Phone rings. Phone rings. Fuck off.

Addiction is an anvil. Holds you down. Still shaking. Boss mailed you a letter, Record Of Employment. 

Addiction is a blank stare. Shaking. Shake it off. Everything is heavy. Rain or sweat? Wading through your house. Nightmare. Alone. 

Addiction is water, waist-high. House wrecked. Where’s your phone..?

Addiction is water, chest-deep. Lungs heavy. Legs heavy.

Addiction is drowning. You’re drowning. You’re drowning in it. Addiction. Phone rings. 

Addiction is water, filled lungs. Gurgles.  Phone rings. Addiction. Word hangs in your throat. You can’t escape.

Addiction is a noose. Tight.

"Hello,

About 10 months ago the worst thing that ever happened to me occurred. I lost my Mother to her addiction of what we thought at the time was just alcohol, but was later revealed that she was abusing painkillers and other substances as well. 

Before her addiction she was a wonderful Mother. Loving, supportive and what I thought at the time was the best damn mom in the world. In her final years she was angry, spiteful and cruel. At times I didn't recognize the women I was looking at. 

My Mother was unable to win her battle with addiction. Hell, she just barely go to the point where she admitted to us she had a problem. A month later she was in the Hospital for liver failure. Two weeks after that she was dead. She was 47. 

She had been in the hospital 3 times before the last and each time the doctor warned her not to drink. She would hand wave it away and say the doctors didn't know what they were talking about. She died in agony and we all had to watch while her body was slowly poisoned by toxins her body could no longer cleanse. 

My mothers addiction has tainted and corrupted her very memory for my family and me. It is so hard to think of her before her addiction took hold. I am so angry at her and sometimes hate her for putting her family through that. All my most recent memories were of here in despair, anger and regret. The Trauma of watching her slowly kill herself will be with me for the rest of my days. 

I share this terrible story in hopes that it may save someone someday. It is literally the only good thing that could possibly come from these events. Please know that if you are fighting you are doing the right thing, keep going! Don't give up. For those who may be reading and have so far been unwilling to tackle the problem of addiction. Please find the strength to do so! Whatever the cost of the battle it is much less then dying slow in a shitty hospital bed while all your loved ones look on in helplessness and have to bare witness to your decay and the lifelong trauma that goes with it. 

TL;DR
My Mother died from her addiction. Please don't follow her path. Get help and overcome your addiction by any means necessary. If not for you...then for your loved ones.  ",NA

"""Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through your own pain. Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. Whatever the substance you are addicted to - alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a person - you are using something or somebody to cover up your pain. That is why, after the initial euphoria has passed, there is so much unhappiness, so much pain in intimate relationships. They do not cause pain and unhappiness. They bring out the pain and unhappiness that is already in you. Every addiction does that. Every addiction reaches
a point where it does not work for you anymore, and then you feel the pain more intensely than ever.""

"/r/cbd has more information than I do, I'm still pretty new to it.  But now I'm off 5 prescriptions, and I was using kratom for the past few years to be able to take something that wasn't dangerous like alcohol.  But something in my brain still was irritating and they tried a lot of pills.

But I also have a mild autism diagnosis and I know specifically cbd oil is mostly helping with the over-sensory autism issues where lights and sounds cause fight/flight to go off and have panic attacks.  

That's a big reason I was self medicating, and cbd oil is stopping it where I have zero cravings now for anything.  

Maybe it's placebo, but it's working much better than any pill ever has, I'm not intoxicated, I'm not spending but $30 a month on cbd now.  I'm volunteering, exercising, eating better.   People ask ""what was wrong with you before"" now.  It's very strange being able to be happy and smile.  Very uncomfortable.

I never get my hopes up much because they have been constantly crushed for decades, but 35 years and over 20 prescriptions later and I'm content the rest of my life, I'll have zero problems with addiction or depression/anxiety as long as I have cbd oil.

Has to be 3rd party lab tested and not from China.  Also full spectrum works much better for me than the isolate (often what the vape oil is made from, and it doesn't work as well medically for some, but if you can't fail a drug test, isolate is recommend, but full spectrum still shouldn't cause a drug test fail, there are only trace amounts of THC that you can't feel at all.  The ""[entorauge effect](https://www.projectcbd.org/science/terpenes/terpenes-and-entourage-effect)"" only happens though with full spectrum.

Kratom probably kept me out of jail, but it did become an addiction taking over an oz every day for a few years.  Idk, cbd is causing zero high, but is stopping the irritation that was there at birth, I cried as a baby all day long, my skin was so sensitive.  Everything seems much louder and brighter to me.  Now I can go in grocery stores without panic attacks though.  So this might not be an answer for addiction but an answer to autism over-sensory issues.  But maybe someone else has some irritation like I did.  It's really amazing, over 20 prescriptions and I went off 5 at once after telling my doctor and going slowly.  Unless I had an [endocannabinoid deficiency](https://echoconnection.org/clinical-endocannabinoid-deficiency/)  It's fixing something, I just don't know what, but it's major in my case.

Many people try cbd and it does nothing at all for them.  Those people tend to be mentally already doing well, but also there are some in very bad shape and cbd just isn't enough.  But it's safe, not addictive (according to the FDA who just approved their own version), and about to be prescribed by doctors on a large scale in the next few months.  So everyone is going to know about it soon anyway.  I just think every human being should try this and at least see if it helps something.  35 years with that hell in my brain and it's just gone.  I've been in a bed alone for years, and now I'm going in public.  100&#37; of my life was online.  I don't know people in person other than the few at the volunteer place.  I'm probably mentally about 15 years old at 35, so don't take my word for anything, do your own research :)",Ambiguous

I leave behind a legacy tainted

A picture for fools my soul hath painted

Sorrow and destitution 

Are they not my lone companion

Seared into the minds of all who lay eyes upon me

My heart beats as that of a funeral drum

For is this not what it was destined? 

Fool! 

Tis but the only cry of my soul 

All humanity, imparted by god hath died in me 

A song of sorrow doth my eyes sing with but a passing glance

Look not upon me for I am but a shadow 

heard I am not for I have no voice with which to speak

Seek not my path for it is wrought with the screams of the unclean And the cries of the sinful

Tortured is my mind 

Surely the wrathful hand of god hath smote my face

Every minute of my life pushes me further to the assuredness of my death 

Ask me not how or why this has befallen me, for I have no answer

Surely death himself hath made my demise of a slow and painful nature

Take care, little one, not to follow in my footsteps, for I am nothing 

The wicked fangs pump the poison into my veins

I feel the venom course through my body

Sealed is my fate 

The funeral procession is coming

My heart beats slower

My eyes grow tired

And in an instant I am nothing

For I was never here 

I was never alive

I was never seen

I was never heard 

And for this I am forgotten

"[The photo in question.](https://imgur.com/a/jak6LBb)

The above picture I took in early 2016. I was at the peak of my addiction to prescription opiates, mainly codeine and dihydrocodeine but often whatever I could get my hands on. On more than one occasion I took 28 tablets at a time. **Twenty Eight**. 

Before the picture I had drank a full bottle of Codeine Linctus and taken a handful of pills, as you can see I got hit fucking hard by the histamines and I'm pretty out of it. I actually had to go to work, upon arriving I was sent home immediately (and sacked a few weeks later). There was a moment, maybe 2 months after that picture was taken, where I found myself being offered heroin. I had it right there in front of me, I was going to take it and I just ran. I ran from the flat I was in and didn't contact that group of friends for a while, come to think of it we haven't really spoke at all since.

Currently I am in a bit of a tough spot, dropping out of university, I'm at a crossroads. There is immediate pressure to find a job and soon a place to live. Since getting over the worst of my pill addiction I have gained over 60lbs of weight also, and I was already fat before. 

I suppose the purpose of this post is to remind myself that despite not being where I want to be in life right now, I've come so far. I won't go into detail about the depression and things that happened that lead to my addiction, but I have moved on from alot of that in recent months. I have not taken opiates since October last year, and that was a brief relapse before I flushed the rest down the toilet. 

My next addiction to overcome is food. I've got a fitbit and a gym membership which I hope can give me some extra motivation for the long road ahead of me. I have around 100lbs to lose to be at a healthy weight, however, finding that photo made me really think about how much worse life could be.

"Today I celebrate 30 years of sobriety
I got sober in 1988 when I was 17 years old.  I had been drinking daily for 9 years and had spent most of my time from the age of 12 up until that point as a runaway.  I found my path in AA (not saying that’s the only way, it’s just the way that worked for me).  I had to learn how to have fun, as well as how to live life on life’s terms.  The program and the fellowship I found there made that possible.  If you are new to this please know that not only is it really possible, but it is awesome too.  Life has been great!  I may not be a rich man, but I am surrounded by people that love me, I have two sons that have gotten to grow up with a sober father, and I look forward to every day.  Thank you all for the gift of this amazing life.",Recovered

"1 Year Clean and Sober Today from Heroin Addiction!
Today marks one year clean and sober from the use of heroin and any other drug or alcohol. I started out life in Catholic school raised in a good neighborhood with a good family, proving that this disease doesn't discriminate. I had a lot of friends and I was the guy who said heroin addicts are dirty people I would never use a needle. Well I became that guy. Lifes only purpose was to get that next one and getting well was my only focus. Putting all important things in life like my daughter, my health and everything else on the back burner. I did a lot of bad things to a lot of good people that I truly do regret and have since made amends to. Without really getting into my war story, my story started out with a lower back injury that led to an addiction to percocets and xannex which eventually turned into a full blown heroin addiction, which lead to 3 accidental overdoses in 3 weeks. After being in and out of treatment a few times I finally got the help I desperately needed and wanted. I sat in Friends crisis Hospitals waiting room for 4 days because there we're no beds available sick as a dog but I made friends with a nice girl who let's just say helped me from being sick. I eventually got 28 days of treatment at a facility in West Philadelphia called Kirkbride which saved my life. I met a counselor there by the name of Darryl who was extremely passionate about recovery and his model was ""just do it"". That man, plays a buge part in my life with who I am today. Darryl encouraged me to write poetry because he saw something in me where I saw nothing. Today, I am working on a book of poetry to be published and be my first publication as an author (hopefully reaching a coffee table near you someday soon lol). I volunteer a lot of my time because I want to give back because it's important people know that recovery is possible and life does get better. Kirkbride offered a lot of good things that I got involved with such as the 12 step program which I completed in treatment to keep my mind from wandering. I met a lot of great people in the short period of time in treatment which helped me get through a lot. Most importantly I know who I am today. If I knew back then what I know today I probably wouldn't have gone through what I went through, but hey live and let live. Today I am the volunteer coordinator assistant at Pro Act (hoping to get hired) an organization that focuses on recovery principles and promotes the well being of others, where I am happy to wake up everyday and help addicts not only with my story but by getting people into treatment as well as helping with resumes, job applications. Today my main focus is helping others which helps me stay clean and for that I'm grateful. Everyday is a gift from the Lord and everyday above ground is a great day.

"It's midnight, so I have 8 fuckin years clean
It's been fucking crazy. In no way have the last 8 years been easier than the 8 years BEFORE I got clean. All I had to worry about then was getting the next fix or my next release date from whatever institution I was in.
 These years have been better, though. I've grown, I've discovered a career in tattooing, I've loved, I've lost, I've gone absolutely batshit crazy and hit a few soulcrushing bottoms clean, and I've survived them. 
 I've survived myself.
 This is the bottom line: I was a gutter junkie that other gutter junkies considered a threat and didn't want around. I was toxic to everything I touched. Everything. My family cut me off, I terrorized whole neighborhoods. But I got clean... And somehow I've stayed clean.
 I'm not some kinda badass. You know what's fucking badass? What is absolutely hard fucking core? 3 days clean... 10 days... 30 days clean. Keep at it, please. ""Don't give up before the miracle."" I couldn't get 3 days clean without being locked up, and even then I usually found a way.
 The moral of my little rant is that if an addict like ME can get and stay clean, ANY ADDICT CAN.

"Alcoholic, crack, coke etc, but now about to get an MBA. It gets better.
[http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com](http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com)

I can't believe that I'm about to earn my MBA. I had fucked up my life pretty bad. I flunked out of college and became a raging drug addict / alcoholic. I lost so many jobs, apartments, friends, my self respect and I lived really hard for a couple of decades. My life was filled with alcohol, drugs and during that time I also did stand up for 15 years, starting in Austin, and then working at the Comedy Store in La Jolla for 3 years.

I went back to school at the age of 41, attending Houston Community College, and I earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Houston in 2015 at the age of 45.  I was still drinking every day, throwing up in the bathroom, and sometimes doing blow before an exam. I wasn't able to walk away from booze and coke until I started my MBA program. Yeah, I partied a long time, thought that my brain was fried, but then I just started with one Spanish class. Just one class. I made an A and then that started to help me build self-confidence.

I thought that my earlier drug use dictated my future, but no...fuck that. You can change the direction of your life. It may take a long time, but it can be done. I used to smoke crack playa.

I share all of this and how it all started with my early speech problems, bullying, depression, and anxiety on my blog [http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com](http://dropoutsmokecrackgetmba.com)

"9 months clean from benzos, heroin, and meth
I started doing drugs 17 years ago and I never stopped. I have the same story as everyone else. I thought I was different. I thought that I wouldn’t ever be addicted.

At first, I started taking benzos and drinking. Then I added painkillers and adderall. My tolerance kept getting higher, and eventually I started shooting heroin and meth.

I lost my wife and kids, my career, my house, and my car. I pawned every single thing that I found around my house that was valuable before I had to move in with my mom. Then I started taking things from her house.

I fucking traded canned goods and leftover pizza that I took out of her kitchen for dope.

I wallowed in a pit of misery and isolation for a few months. I was talking to a friend one night about how I was sick of feeling like this. She said, “you need to go to rehab.” I thought about it and finally said ok and just started bawling. Up until this point, I knew I was an addict, but I had resisted the idea of rehab. 

I went.

I’ve been clean for 9 months now. I got back into my career and my daughter moved in with me.

I’d like to say everything is amazing, but it’s not. I’ve had some really bad things happen. But it’s so much easier to deal with the bad things when you’re not wallowing in guilt and shame. 

I struggle with anxiety and bouts of depression and urges to self-medicate those conditions.

I was a tough case but the time allowed me to suspend all of my preconceived notions about my disease and get sober. I have found a new freedom and a new happiness.

"it’s officially been one year xanax free.
hi guys,

I don’t usually do this kind of thing but I feel compelled to share that it’s been exactly one year from today that I’ve been free of xanax. It was the most difficult experience i’ve ever had to deal with and I’ve battled heroin addiction at a young age yet I found this much harder...

I know how scary it is to think of a reality without benzos and the overwhelming fear of doing ANYTHING without it; the bouts of depression and anxiety when you realize that you’ve built a tolerance and physical dependence from taking it daily, then needing to take more just to minimize the rebound anxiety together with the constant questions of “how do you cope with generalized anxiety without it? social anxiety? how can I do ANYTHING without a benzo?” Eventually I was taking enough to knock me out until 12:00 pm the next day without hearing MULTIPLE alarm clocks. 

A year ago today I suffered a nervous breakdown from abusing benzos and amphetamines in order to keep up with my fast paced and abusive job (which I eventually quit) and checked myself into an outpatient program to get off the benzos. Once I tapered off xanax, I thought I was losing my mind. Once I tapered off klonopin, forget about it... I couldn’t drive. I couldn’t leave my house. I was terrified of the world around me. I couldn’t picture socializing or dealing with day-to-day life without a benzo. 

I honestly could not IMAGINE living my life without xanax and/or klonopin. I can’t even remember a life without it... yet today I’m free of all benzos for the first time since 2013 and I can honestly say I’ve never felt better. I can feel my emotions. I can be vulnerable if I want to. I can cry if I want to. My relationship with my boyfriend of 6 years and with my family has improved tremendously. I now have a new job and I feel more alert, focused and motivated to do well. I even went back to school to finish getting my bachelor’s AND I have even gone out of my way to ask my coworkers how their weekends were (this is huge for me) I am no longer a prisoner to benzos.

I just wanted to share this because I remember wanting to get off benzos but was just so consumed with fear and anxiety because the thoughts of being without it was too great. 

so for those of you who are attempting to taper off benzos or have been thinking about getting off of them, I just want you to know that these feelings are 100% normal. you are not alone and there is hope. if I can get off of them, so can you.

Hey so, 

thanks to people like you ladies and gentlemen I am 10 years clean and sober today.

For those curious about how this was done and those who are new I'll explain as follows:

I had about 3 attempts in AA and NA, mainly just attending meetings and stuff but that alone didn't work.

It wasn't until I got tired of relapsing and got super desperate that I got a good sponsor and went through the ""clear cut directions showing how we recovered"" -pg 29 in the book 'Alcoholics Anonymous' that everything changed for me and I started to experience a recovery that was really enjoyable with happiness and other cool stuff.

The main thing today that keeps me sober is continuing to work the steps and help others to work the steps through sponsorship.

Even so, there have been times when fully entrenched in the program that I have had to get outside help including counselling because AA does NOT fix everything. 

But basically I was told at the beginning that 'misery is optional' and that there can be an awesome, fun & fulfilling life without drugs and alcohol. 

I love being sober. 

Thanks again everybody and keep up the good work :))

Im not sure my sobriety date, so i just consider it March 2016 as that was the month. Ive been battling with opiates since I was 15, and this is by far my longest clean period. I've never felt this stable since starting opiates! Over time, I have taken a deeper look at my relapses and what happened beforehand that lead to me spiralling out of control. Then the next step was to quash the chance of it happening before it grew unmanagable. The biggest thing for me was a clear pattern of stopping going to meetings, then stopping therapy. As I slowly stopped going, I slowly became more and more inclined to use. Id think it had been long enough so i could go out on my own, but recovery is a process and i was nowhere near ready to stop going. Meetings and counseling are a huge support system.

"23 years sober this month
My sobriety date is 7/9/91. I have not been very active on these subs lately because of a crazy schedule, haven’t been to many meetings either, and just wanted to check in and share some things to keep me focused. 

I was 28 when I got sober after a 14 year drinking career, 10 of those years as a daily drinker, the last 5 mostly in isolation. I hated everything about who I was and the way I was living my life, but didn't know how to change it. I came out of a blackout (a common occurrence for me) in my apartment with the yellow pages open to treatment centers. I called an 800#. I don’t remember what I said but I’ll never forget what the lady on the other end said: “based on what you’ve described, in another 30 days you’re either going to be dead or you will have killed someone.” That was my moment of clarity, those words rang true to my core, I could see that train coming right at me. 

I got into treatment and learned that it’s the first drink I have to avoid. My experience tracks perfectly with the disease model of alcoholism: a mental obsession to start drinking coupled with an allergic reaction that makes it impossible to stop drinking. The thought of not taking the first drink had NEVER occurred to me. 

Relapse is not part of my story. I think it’s because the above experiences seared into my brain that drink = death. My brain does that quickly now, even with a little “oh wouldn’t a glass of chardonnay [my drink of choice] be nice with this dinner?” I know intimately how people struggle with relapse and am forever grateful that I’ve managed to avoid that. 

I’ve been pretty active in AA the entire time but haven’t done it perfectly. Years 8-11 I was mostly absent until I realized I was trying to justify why it would be OK to start smoking weed again. I knew where that would lead and got myself back to meetings. After a week of daily meetings my crazy and negative thinking had completely turned around. It’s still amazing to me how that works. For me, if I’m not checking in with other recovering alcoholics, I’m not hearing what I need to hear. 

I’ve had an amazing life so far, some of it horrible, lots of it fantastic. I’ve learned to be grateful for all of it. One of the most important lessons I’ve had in sobriety is the concept of relativity: an opposite has to exist for me to appreciate anything. If I was happy all the time, I wouldn’t know it. Grief is evidence that I love. Setbacks are evidence of prior success, and I can do it again. And I’ve had all of that. Have buried both parents, lost jobs, long periods of unemployment a couple of times, changing careers, all things in storage, living out of friends guest rooms for 2 years (this was years 10-12 of sobriety!), a confused straight marriage, a mostly successful gay relationship that ended tragically, with me finding him dead in bed from an overdose. And drinking never occurred to me during any of that because I know today it doesn’t solve anything, only makes everything worse. 

My life today is approaching fairy tale status. Three years into a highly successful relationship, an amazing job that pays very well, financially secure in a way I’ve never been, lots of travel, great friendships. And if I picked up a drink today that would all be lost. And if I don’t, in the back of my mind I know how relativity works: this too may pass anyway. And if it does, I’ll keep going and build again. I know today how to transform my life, I’ve done it now several times over. That’s what I wanted when I came into recovery: a transformed life. Life is 10% what happens and 90% how I respond to it. AA set the stage for making that happen and I’ve done a ton of outside work to keep it going. 

I still work with a handful of sponsees who seem to want what I have; I’m only going to meetings 1-2x a month now because of a wild work schedule with lots of business travel and also working on a masters degree. I chaired a major recovery conference in 2013 and frankly am appreciating the break. We’ll see how long it lasts. 

What hasn’t changed is my daily reflection that I’m an alcoholic who can’t drink today, and every day I need to do something that keeps me balanced and focused: some reading, a little meditation, get to the gym, eat right, stay in touch with close friends – alcoholic or not. 

And this morning, this was what I needed to do to stay focused. Thanks for reading.

"Two years ago today was the last time I picked up a drink or a drug.
1-25-11 was the last time I ever picked up a drink or a drug. I was 15 years old, and I had just spent the last four months cheating rehab by smoking spice, and drinking the nights before the days I wouldn't get drug tested. But on this day two years ago, I decided to give it an honest shot. I joined AA, and worked the twelve steps. I found a home group, and I've made some of the best friends I could ever hope to have. I entered the program as a depressed, anxiety ridden 15 yearold tweaker, and today, I am a somewhat sane sober 17 yearold. I got into my program and didn't want to work it all. I wouldn't accept that I am an alcoholic, and I just stayed dry. When I told myself I'd give the program an honest shot, I mostly meant I would just stay sober. I wasn't gonna work any steps. But I wanted to keep my rehab happy, and my parents happy, so I got a sponsor and started the steps. To my amazement, even though I didn't give a flying fuck about the steps, they still worked. They kept me sober. And once I started to feel good about myself for the first time in my life, I started to care. I realized that I hated everything about myself, and for the first time in mylife I was happy, and I knew it was from the steps, and the fellowship, and from being of slight service at my meetings. From that point on, i started to give a shit. I still give a shit, and today I have two years sober. If you're new to program, just keep coming back. Go through the motions no matter how uncomfortable. The program works, it really does. It worked for me, and I was resisting it. I didnt want it to work, and it did. If it will work for someone like me, I can't even imagine how well it works for someone who truly wants it, right from the start.

My name is John W, and I'm an alcoholic. Thanks for letting me share.

When you would casually laugh it off when people commented that you put on weight because even when you started getting a belly and it was because you were actually getting healthier and eating. I can never imagine how hard it must have been to distance yourself from your friends who tried to influence you back into your old lifestyle which I know would have been so easy at times. I know you've said to me that today is more important to you than your birthday and even bigger than your cake day. So I hope you are proud of yourself today and everyday because you've made it one more year and I will still be proud of you 50 years from now and even though I'm not standing in your corner I am still cheering you on.

Well, today marks 2 years of consecutive sobriety for me, all achieved 1 day at a time. For that reason, I guess I don't *feel* any different today, just like how I didn't *feel* any different after 1 year.  I will say that the big difference between my first and second year of sobriety is; 1st year meetings and fellowship is really what kept me sober. 2nd year *service* is what kept me sober.  I was a very low bottom case. Eviction, homelesness, psych ward, a night in jail ... And today, I have a small but nice apartment downtown, I'm back in school for something I love, and I have relationships with friends and family.  I am eternally grateful for these things and they are in large part because of AA and surrender. For anyone struggling, please just keep coming back. The promises *do* come true, and it does get better.  ***Edit. Thanks for all the kind responses! :) Forgot to ad, and I feel like it is important for others to read, when I first came in to AA I was 25. I am 27 now. I was then, and am still now, thought of by most as young. Which may be true as you don't see a lot of young people in AA that stick around. I share this so other younger people who think they couldn't possibly get or stay sober that age has no effect on this. It may get harder as you get older. Recovery at any age is possible.

"Today Marks My 3 Year Anniversary
2 1/2 years ago, during the Christmas holidays, I found myself alone in my grandmothers house. I was strung out on cocaine, smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking vodka as if it were water.  I was in possession of a gun and in one of the lowest moments of my life- I considered that as my only option out.

At that point I had been battling depression, drug addiction and alcoholism for almost 10 years. I would have some short stints of clarity and sober time, but it never lasted and the consequences of my actions were becoming more severe. 

Back to me sitting in my grandmothers bathtub holding a bottle of vodka in one hand and a gun in the other- I just couldn’t imagine my life getting any better.  Thankfully, and miraculously, my 2 yr old cat came around the corner and just started meowing, and he just kept meowing until I got up and went over to pet him. He sat on my lap and wouldn’t get up- I wound up passing out with my back against the wall and my cat on my lap. 

6 months later I finally hit a legal consequence that jolted me enough to consider seeking help. It took what it took to get me sitting in a room, full of strangers, listening to people who had similar stories to mine. I told myself I would give this a shot, just for 6 months and then I’ll decide if I wanted to keep doing this. I wound up detoxing on my buddies couch, moved into a house full of sober people, and started making meetings.

In the beginning I took all the suggestions, worked the program to the best of my ability and 3 years later I am so incredibly grateful. I didn’t just get my life back- I was given a whole NEW life.

This past year has been rough, a lot of changes have occurred and I gotta be honest, the same enthusiasm I had 3 years ago for the program isn’t at the same level. There have been times this past year where I found myself tempted to pick up and drink again. What has saved me is my unwavering faith in a power greater than myself. No matter how often or far I may stray, I concede to my inner most self that I am an alcoholic/drug addict and I will never be able to drink/drug “normally” and that my God will always show up, even in the darkest of times. I have to believe those two things or I surely would relapse and I’m not guaranteed a seat back.

It was gonna be a great meeting and my share was going to be fantastic. 

But I feel so hollow. Drained and apathetic. Like I couldn't really give a fuck. I do everything that I should be doing. I go to meetings almost every day, I have a great relationship with my sponsor. I do service at two meetings. I have a good network of fellow addicts. I work the steps. All of that shit. But I still feel empty. I don't want to use and I want to stay clean but I have cravings every day. I feel like there are so much work left. I'm six months in and I just want this shit to be over.

I have responsibilities now. And to be honest being the best version of yourself is fucking exhausting. Overwhelming. I guess I miss not giving a flying fuck about anything at all like in my active addiction, in a sense shit was a lot easier back then. 

I can always go back, I know that. But I don't want to go back. My life was horrible and I don't want to use. But these fucking cravings man. I want them gone.

Ok, my homegroup meets on Friday and my sobriety bday was Saturday, so no image of a 22 year coin just yet.

The recurring theme in my life recently is that temporary is only temporary, not permanent.  I keep seeing a lack of patience popping up on the various recovery subs in Reddit so now I'm starting to pound that topic in my weekly meeting.  I forget the angst and impatience of early sobriety but certainly understand the benefits of staying the course, doing the next right thing, and accepting the results (generally ridiculously positive results at that).

Alright, enough about me for a moment...

Let's give a hand to /u/judasblue and /u/SOmuch2learn for the bang up job of moderating this place!  I do a little here and there but they're the ones handling the majority of the spam and moderator requests.  /u/Program_Buddhist has been AWOL for a couple years now, but he's good stuff so let's see if he shows up before 2020 or so.

I didn’t know any better honestly. If I did, I would have done better. That’s my new motto, and I’m sticking to it. Haha!

Anyway, I am super excited, and I’m working on Year 2, one day at a time. 

How’d I do it? I’ll tell you. I went to a meeting almost every day for the entire year. I worked the steps with my sponsor. I got involved in H&I. I didn’t hang with using friends, or at bars or clubs. I immersed myself in my hobbies and career goals. I dated around which was not a good thing, but it was really another addiction for me. This year, I’m staying single. I’m over dating honestly. I can’t commit for the life of me, and people tend to piss me off. Ya, that’s right, I’m a hater. I just hate. But I’m working on it. Can’t work on it until you accept it right? I meditate like 20 mins every other night, and pray here and there, and try to keep a positive attitude. Progress is very gradual for me, but I am much better than the monster I used to be.

"At midnight it will be 37 years sober.
One man's story.
(warning: wall of text)
OK, so it's now 37 years sober and the first thing anyone asks, that is if they're at all interested, is ""how did you do it?""

The simple answer would be that I didn't, but my Higher Power did.

A less simple answer would be that I was lucky enough to realize I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and so I did what AA in its collective wisdom told me to do.

So what was the trigger?  To this day I don't honestly know. I had been hospitalized twice with DTs and was given up for dead or at least near-dead once. But, hey, I'm an alcoholic so I did what alcoholics do when they get out of the hospital -- I drank just like I always did, about a fifth of cheap vodka a day.

Then, drunk as a skunk on Valentine's Day I jumped into the car with my wife and headed across a snowy Wyoming Valley to the local detox center.  No, not some expensive rehab center, but a dirty, grungy stop-of-last-resort for the area's drunks.

My wife was appalled at the treatment I got, enough so that she was launched into a near-20-year career in the drug and alcohol field. I do know they took my shoes away, all the while telling me I was free to leave anytime. Yes, sure, with 4"" of snow on the ground on the side of a mountain.  Most of my detox stay remains a blur. I do know I was sick and miserable and slept a lot.

Then, on the last day -- by this time I'd earned a pair of corduroy slippers -- I went to my first AA meeting. It was mandatory, by the way. Not much registered except that the key to sobriety was 90 meetings in 90 days. I also picked up the nugget that my only job was to stay sober.

Not being a particularly religious sort I wasn't really into the spiritual aspects of the program, but deep inside I knew that something outside of myself was keeping me sober. So, OK, let's call it my Higher Power, whatever it might be.

They told me I'd probably lose my drinking buddies. They were right, I did, but it really wasn't a great loss. I had this enduring and unrealistic fear that if I went into a bar someone from AA would see me and I'd get my ass kicked. So I didn't.

Years go by. By the time I had 12 years sober I reasoned that I'd maybe gotten a little walking-around sense that could be of use to AA, which by then I realized had saved my life. So I did all the service jobs, and I mean almost all. I never became the District Chairman, but I came close.

Meetings every week became the norm. They kept telling me that maybe I didn't need a meeting every week, but it was good insurance. That was enough for me.

By 30 years it became apparent that I'd finally found a new way of life and alcohol wasn't a part of it. I was firmly convinced that I was like a black man -- I could change the status, but I was still black, only in my case the word isn't black, it's alcoholic. 

Where to now at 37 years?  I realize I have more years behind me than ahead of me -- life is like that. I'm still wedded to the alcoholic community -- bought tires today from a guy who'se an alcoholic. Why? Because unlike most tire salesmen, I knew he was honest. Guess that's a fringe benefit.

Why am I posting this wall of text? 

Not for self aggrandizement, I assure you. Maybe it's to show newcomers or mid-termers that long term sobriety is quite do-able even though the first steps seem insanely difficult. I figure if just one person decides to challenge me and stay sober for 37 years and one day it will have been a worthwhile exercise. Especially since one day -- today -- is all we really have.

What have I learned in 45 years of sobriety? 

(In no particular order) 

Nothing original - most learned in little rooms with big books – from giants. 

I can be my own worst enemy.

Listen, to everyone, at least long enough to find out if they have anything worth saying. 

It’s not my job to judge, or to be judged.

We are almost always stronger, smarter than me. 

I owe my life to others. It wasn’t me that got me sober, I didn’t know how to.

The unexamined life is not worth living – Socrates

Apologize, as quickly as possible.

Some people seem to be meant to be bad examples, try not to be one of them.

Be harder on yourself than on others, then learn to go easy on yourself.

You’re not perfect, nor are you supposed to be.

The worst lies I ever told were to myself. 

There is life after drinking, a much better one.

Always say please and thank you.

Ask.

Whenever possible do unexpected kindness for someone

Before acting on a bright idea, ask others. 

Some of the worst advice I ever got came from me to myself. 

I’m worth it.

Trust nothing you were taught without examination. Some things you learned, were taught, are just not true. It’s your job to figure those out. 

Choose your friends wisely.  They are the ones who can save you or kill you.

Learn to forgive others so you can forgive yourself. 

For those with a religious bent: If you regard yourself as a child of God, however you conceive that, think it through. Your God is referred to as some kind of king, and your spiritual father.  If your ‘father’ is a king, what does that make you?

I'm 14 weeks pregnant and am currently in the ER because I'm pretty sure I have kidney stones.

He was struggling with getting a vein to register, so I took a deep breath and said, ""Try above my tattoo, at the edge of my elbow crease. Use that old stretch mark to guide you.

He seemed kinda flustered with himself for taking so many tries. I looked at him and said, ""Hey, for what it's worth, don't beat yourself up. Everyone has to start somewhere and at least I wasn't a middle aged soccer mom demanding to speak to your supervisor."" We both chuckled.

Some times it works out tho. When I was in treatment, I made full plans to get out, spend a couple days partying hard, and then kill myself. That was just *the plan*, because there was no way I could even imagine a life clean. But then the plan changed. I took some suggestions, I did some work, and here we are.

You know at a lot of 12 step meetings, the secretary will mention to turn off your cell phone and keep side talk to a minimum so someone won't miss the one thing that might save their life that night. I remember hearing that, and I started listening intently for that one thing that would save my life. So I listened, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited.... and I never  heard ""that one thing."" It really wasn't what anyone said that gave me hope, I couldn't possibly tell you what they said.

"NA is mindblowing
I'm 50 years fucking old and got hooked on Kratom.  This, after being clean for a year where my last DOC was alcohol.  Lots of shit before that which didn't involve needles.  But if you can snort it, swallow it, or stick it up my ass for better effects, I was probably hooked on it.  

After realizing I needed a different approach, and FINALLY accepting that maybe I don't actually know everything, I figured I'd try NA.  Now I did a few AA meetings when I quick drinking, but just could not buy into it.  The meetings I went to had too many folks saved by Jesus.  Which, honestly, I really wish the fuck I could be.  But I wasn't, and therefore I stopped going.  PLUS...I was still in control with AA just a tool that I utilized.  

This time I was more spiritually mature, having finally making a connection to a God that I believe in...one that is in me as well as everything else.  Plus, I no longer wanted to control this quit or my addiction.  Fucking done with that shit.  

I promised myself to do 30 meetings in 30 days in hopes that maybe I would get lucky and find 1 meeting that maybe I could tolerate.  This is a great example of how setting expectations just does not work.  I expected 29 shitty meetings.

My intitial plan was to do both NA and AA.  The first meeting I went into was an NA meeting.  Where again, my expectations was that I was going to find saved people or a bunch of people who could not help themselves.  

Immediately, all expectations were blown out the window.  Right from the very second I walked through the door.  An absolute mind-blowing experience.  

For the first time in my life I was surrounded by people who knew me.  They knew everything about me because I summed up my life in 4 words: I am an addict.

They knew I thought I was smart as fuck and thought I could figure this out.  They knew I over analyzed and thought too deep into things.  They knew I was obsessed with fixing the one problem I thought I needed to fix.  They knew everything about me. 

Normally I don't like to socialize.  I find it difficult to hold a conversation unless I'm drunk or high.  For sure, nobody wants to talk about what's on MY mind.  Except in NA.  It's so damn easy to approach somebody.  And better yet, they approach ME!  And GENUINELY want to get to know me better.  

I am on going to my 16th meeting tonight.  I've made the effort to visit a different meeting every night so I can see what's going on in my area.  Every single one of those meetings has been absolutely awesome.  With easily half of them being ones that I can call home.  

Anyway...

"Off of heroin 5 years, doing well
I was in a very bad place as a young adult. I went from being a chronic stoner and SEVERE alcoholic as well as a pill user from age 14 to 21, to being a heroin addict from 21 to 25. I hurt my mind and body badly during those years. I went 9k in credit card debt at one point. I experienced some extremely dark and awful times. There were many points when I didn't think I would make it. All of us here know the daily living nightmare of having a serious addiction.


After inpatient rehab I went into recovery and started taking suboxone. I got off suboxone for a short time and went through severe withdrawal without knowing it. It was a different withdrawal from heroin; Instead of physical pain, I just mentally couldn't function. I started drinking again heavily to cope. Eventually I chronically smoked crack for about 2 months. I never felt like my life was in more danger than during those 2 months. Crack is a disgusting drug, and I regret ever trying it. I got back on suboxone and leveled out. 


I got into school for x-ray. School was difficult. I relapsed a couple times when I tried and failed to quit suboxone. All of my schoolmates (12 girls, I was the only guy) were squeaky-clean conservative robots of efficiency who didn't understand at all when I went through hard times. I lost all my friends. I distanced myself from the friends who used, and the friends who didn't use distanced themselves from me. School was kind of its own nightmare at times. I realized that I couldn't quit suboxone and be successful in school as the withdrawals lasted so long. 


I made it through however, and finally got a job in another town 2 hours away as a 3rd shift xray tech. 3rd shift was hard for me, as my mind had taken such a beating that it didn't really deal with sleep deprivation well. At 8 months in, I started burning out very quickly. 


Luckily at that time, a 2nd shift position opened up. It was there that I started finding myself. I discovered how to take suboxone appropriately and how to mind my sleep hygiene so that I could function as close to 100% as someone like me can get. People actually started LIKING me, and being happy when they saw me. I adopted two cats. I became one of the best employees in the department. My manager started talking me up to her colleagues in the hospital and the MRI manager started catching me in the halls trying to convince me to join MRI. I finally accepted an interview and was hired. I now have good income, I'm free of credit card debt, I'm free of drugs and alcohol, and most of the time I'm pretty happy and proud of myself.


Life is still hard sometimes. On the weekends I'm so exhausted sometimes I just lay in bed the whole day. I get brain fog occasionally if I don't sleep properly. I have to watch my sleep hygeine like a hawk to make sure I'm sharp enough to do my job. Sometimes I just lay in the bottom of the shower for half an hour because it's all I really want to do. No one at work knows my secret past and sometimes that's hard, but it's the way it has to be. I can be quite introverted. My whole immediate family still suffers from addiction problems and disfunctionality.


On the good days however (which are getting more and more common), I'm extremely proud of how far I've come. I paint and draw, I play video games, I'm learning a new language.  I have my own place, my own awesome king-sized bed. I have my two adorable, loving cats. I thank the stars for my mom and dad who never gave up on me along the way. I'm thankful that through a combination of luck and chance I never ended up with any criminal record. I still have my body in good shape, and my brain is slowly recovering. I feel like a real person now. 

I think some day I might end up being truly happy. It's always one step at a time for me. I've heard that your 30s is the best time of your life. I hope that will be true for me. My hard times occur less and less, although I know for someone like me the hard times will always be there now and then. I'm planning a trip to Iceland to see family this summer and I'm getting very excited for it. Things might just turn out alright.

This sub exists as a supportive place for all redditors in recovery. 

Unfortunately, we have been seeing a spate of posts and comments lately that come down to NA sucks or AA sucks. There are plenty of folks who feel that way about some branch of 12 step practice. They have stories and examples from their own experience, or in lieu of same spread random tales they have heard. 

Your mod team has long term clean time in both programs. We are examples that both of these programs work. And we have an open mind about the various 12 step programs we haven't been in, because we have witnessed the steps work and it would appear that different people are attracted to different particular groups working them. 

Posts and comments that are highly divisive will be removed. If they are particularly bashing on the face of them or repeated, the poster will be banned.

This isn't negotiable. The wonderful thing about reddit is that you don't even need a resentment and a coffee pot to start a new community, you just need the resentment. The RiR community is about inclusiveness and support. You want one that is about your chosen path being The One True Way, it takes only a few clicks to start your own sub and start bashing away.

EDIT: 

This post was prompted by a spate of recent postings that were specifically NA vs AA crap. We encourage people to be reasonably respectful here period tho. And yes, that does include being respectful to those folks who are traveling a different path than the 12 steps. A lot of people have a lot of emotional investment in their path, for good reason.

I started crying in the meeting when I read that the medallion was his dad's. My friend still struggles with the most of his dad and it meant so much to me that he gave me his 4 year medallion.

"When life sucks at 20+ years sober....a conversation about long term sobriety
Phillip Seymour Hoffman's relapse and death has rocked my world. He also had 20+ years sober. Then he relapsed and it killed him quickly.  He's not the only one. And then there are those that kill themselves.

To be sure, there are lots that never relapse and die a sober death.

However, my friends and I have talked about some of the buggaboos that hit us when sober a long time.  Here's a short list:

1)Feeling like you can't be honest in a meeting because you are concerned that others with less time will be discouraged if you are having a hard time.

2)Difficulty finding sponsorship

3)Lack of crisis options


I literally have no shame, so I talk in meetings regardless. I know that it has scared some people and I will often address that in the talk. But if the newbies keep showing up they will see that the program has given me tools to MAKE IT THROUGH. The tools are the same at 1 day as they are at 50 years.  Don't drink, work steps, go to meetings, work with others.


I went without a forma sponsor for a couple of years because there aren't many women that have long term sobriety that have time to sponsor in my time. I asked them all. They all turned me down citing lack of time.  At the time I was going through a divorce and I think they were concerned that I would take a lot of support.  So I got a therapist and kept in good touch with my friends. I spread ""it"" around so no one got burned out. And I got through it

I have a sponsor now. She is older than me, but has a about 10 years less sobriety.  But what she has is great and good life experience. So we have gone back through the steps together. It's been great.


Crisis care is harder. There have been times that I felt that if someone wasn't watching me, I might relapse.   I ended up begging my way into co-dependency outpatient program when I had about 3 years because I was so shaky.  The treatment centers wouldn't take me unless I relapsed, which seems backwards to me.  I wish that there was some place where people could go and get residential support  BEFORE they drink or BEFORE they kill themselves.  If you know of any, let me know.


Lastly,  I try to share that sobriety is just that - sobriety. It is not a magic ticket to a Disney movie.  Life continues.  Good, bad - always different.  It is just a lot easier to navigate sober than dead drunk.

I had a bad mountain biking accident 2.5 weeks ago with a terribly painful, infected leg wound. I was communicative with my medical professionals about my history and honest with my sponsor. I took 10 days of oxycodone AS PRESCRIBED (every 4-6 hours). My husband (a sober alcoholic) helped me with the timing. Yes, it made me nervous, yes, I had physical feelings and side effects of addiction very quickly, and yes, I felt depressed getting off them.

My DOC was alcohol but I would and did use any downer. I just feel blessed to have the support and resources that I do today.

I had so many, of what I would have thought of as reasons, to use.  But I didn't have to, and I didn't.  By no means was it easy, I haven't been this clean in 11 years.  It's all new territory from here on.  One day at a time, just for today.  Today I'm showing up for life and letting my Higher Power take care of the rest.  Together, we'll make it the best life ever.  Here is to another thirty.  If anyone is just starting your journey, remember a clean life is a journey, not a destination.

"Tonight I had a legitimate, honest, good night of fun with some friends and it didnt involve amphetamines.
A buddy I met at university invited me over for a night of poker at his place. I spent 4 or 5 hours just hanging out and playing poker with a group of guys, and for the first time in years I legitimately had a good time without Adderall or meth. I'm so happy right now, because I realized it's possible to have fun and laugh and joke around with people WITHOUT using stimulants. I thought this was impossible ever since I began taking drugs.

I have just officially managed five months free of all drugs. No Meth, No Ket, No Xanax, No Alcohol, No Cigarettes...I even drink decaf.

Last night, I was on the way to my first NA meeting when I looked at the meeting schedule--for the first time, I noticed it said ""step study."" I thought, ""Shit, that sounds boring. This is the wrong meeting. I'm going home."" Then I thought, *""Aha!* You're trying to talk yourself out of it!"" It nearly worked. I kept driving.

I pulled up in front of the church, and when I reached the side door a woman came up and gave me a big smile. ""You here for the meeting? NA? *I'm Hope,""* she said.

*Pfft!* You've *got* to be kidding me. ""I'm Hope!"" She was beaming. I was already glad I was there. She wasn't fake but truly warm in a kind of wacky and endearing way.

Inside, the guy who was chairing the meeting--a biker, with long grey hair and a white beard--asked if he could sit next to me. ""Your first meeting!"" he said. ""I want to be next to you. So, you're using?""

The meeting was interesting. I've been to my share of AA meetings, but this was different. These people were *partiers.* They laughed, cracked jokes, made fun of each other, made fun of themselves, and didn't talk much about god or prayer. They were not the least bit pious. There was serious talk, but this was a *party* thrown by people who know how to party.

I just listened. At the end, they gave me a one-day chip and as I got up, the room erupted in hoots and applause. Then a few of them pressed their phone numbers into my hand. 

The truth is, I was planning on getting high after the meeting. I didn't. I got high *on* the meeting, and on the people. (D'aww! How sappy!)

"10 years clean and sober... where the heck did my decade go?
So, I got sober at the tender (and illegal in the US) age of 19 WAAAAY back on May 5th, 2004.  I took a medical leave of absence from college, went to rehab (and then a second rehab without ever relapsing, they just thought I needed that much more help).  After a year of working and going to meetings and taking classes at a local community college, I went back to the school I'd been at.  I graduated in two years (and got great grades when I wasn't acting like I was going for a double major in partying and alcohol tolerance).  After that I applied for a foreign teaching gig, and moved to Japan to be an English teacher for three years at the high school and junior high school level.  Japan was difficult because I wasn't fluent in Japanese so while I could recount the events of my life, I lacked the grammar and vocabulary to talk about my feelings.  While in Japan, I took up a bunch of new hobbies, worked the steps, etc. etc.  I then applied for graduate school and got accepted, and even got some money to help pay for it!  

Now I am just about to finish my fourth year in graduate school, and I look back and cannot believe how far I've come and how much I have changed.  I am amazingly happy, and though I get agitated sometimes, I don't ever get angry.  I nearly always make amends, even if I think that the other person acted worse that I did.  I don't have cravings.  I actively try to help people.  My relationships with my family members, once ruined, are all really really good.  People tell me that I am good person (though not a nice person...), and I find that I am now surrounded with people that like me for me, without agendas.

It still hurts to watch them walk away or for me to leave knowing I don't really have a place to go but home. 

Every time I got drunk I would come out of a blackout using stimulants or wake up days later with hundreds of dollars missing and the telltale signs of opiate use around me. Cops started to be involved more often than not. I had moved towns to get away from myself but less than three months later I was on their radar as a known user. 

Tonight I wanted to drink, fuck, smoke, anything. I drank tea instead. Used music to manipulate my mood. For the first time I finally thought to myself 'I'm glad I didn't drink tonight.'

"4 Years Sober Today...
Hey guys, it is my sober birthday, and today I have 4 years in recovery. I took my last drink on July 4th 2010, after several failed attempts to stop drinking and using. It feels like a million years ago. To think it was just 4 short years ago is scary, but also feels good. 

Back then, I never thought I would be able to live, happily, sober. But I also never really knew what it meant to be happy. In 4 years I got a new job, I got married, moved across the country, and started to feel alive. If I hadn't buckled down and gone to meetings and built my support system, I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, I would be dead today. I wasn't going to make it. I was suicidal, I was alone, I drove drunk and high everyday. I had a death wish. I was a janitor in my old high school, drinking in the closets and puking in sinks. At 28 years old I was still hanging out in my old high school (granted I was working) doing a lot of the same stuff I was doing when I was a student there. It was sad. 

Now I wake up everyday, sometimes groggy, sometimes cranky, but never hung over. I still get caught up in some of the small things; complain about my job, wish I was richer, better, younger, whatever. But most of the time I am able to take a minute and step back, and really put it into perspective. I'm happy now. My life isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but it's manageable. Everyday is a new day. And I think that's the most important thing I was able to learn.

"8 years ago today i hit my rock bottom. Literally.
On September 9th, 2004, i was at the end of my rope. I was using and drinking constantly, i wasn't going back to college, i had lost most of my friends because of my addiction and self centeredness, and i decided to kill myself. I had attempted many times before (that was why i had been kicked out of college, for drinking in the dorms and trying to kill myself often). 

That day (technically sept 8th) i had been drinking and using all day. I got into a fight with the boy i was ""seeing"" (read: sleeping with) because he was going to stay with his girlfriend, because as he said ""why would i date you?! You're crazy!"" I got into a fight with my parents because i was drinking, and i told them i knew theyd be happier if i wasnt in their lives. So i went up to my bedroom on the 3rd floor, looked out my window and thought, ""ok. Either go to bed and be a pussy, or jump out this window and hopefully you die.""

I didn't die. (obviously.) But i did break my back. And as I lay in the grass, looking up at the sky, bawling, i said ""God just do SOMETHING with me! I cant even kill myself, im such a failure!!"" i got up, walked into my house, fought with my parents more, then passed out. When i woke up, i was throwing up blood, so they took me to the hospital, where the xrays showed i had burst a vertebrae. I had to have invasive surgery where they put rods in my spine and took bone marrow from my hip. I had to learn how to walk again, and it was in the hospital that i told my mom i needed help. I told her if i drank or used again, i would in fact kill myself and i needed rehab.

In the past 8 years, ive done rehab, halfway house, sober house, undergrad college (degree in music therapy), graduate school (masters in addiction counseling), and am now working at a treatment center for adolescents. I call my sponsor and my parents often, i go to meetings, and i work the steps. I have sponsees of my own, and i have really amazing friends who have never seen me use.

The things i've gotten from this program are intangible. I am at peace. I dont regret my past, nor wish to shut the door on it. Every day i'm filled with gratitude and acceptance of who i am and how the world around me is. I have my moments of self-loathing (progress not perfection haha) but i have the ability now to speak up and ask for help. I live by principles not personalities.

So I completely ruined my nose with coke. I was supposed to have surgery to repair it almost exactly three years ago, but bailed on the appointment because I knew I'd just shove drugs up it while it was healing and make it worse.

I'm so proud of myself for getting to the point in recovery where I can really start to clean up the mess I made of my life. I'm so excited to breathe out of my nose again, not have nosebleeds every time I exert myself (has been really standing in the way of exercise, which is great for my mental health. It also bled when I laughed, cried, vomited (a rarity, now!), And (extremely shittily) when I orgasmed). Also my migraines and sleep should improve greatly once I am healed. 

I am in a great deal more pain than I expected post-surgery but it's worth it to be able to experience everything I've been avoiding because of my nose. Taking my life back from addiction and alcoholism has been the hardest and most worthwhile thing I have ever done, and to feel like I have ""earned"" this surgery is a big step for me, and I am learning to pat myself on the back when I deserve it.

"My Tattoo
About 20 years ago, a good friend of mine stabbed me with a pencil. I was reaching for something on his desk and he went to swat my hand away, not realizing he was holding a pencil. The tip snapped off in my finger, I had to go to the hospital to get it removed. My friend was absolutely sick over it — even at that age, he always had a real soft heart. When I got it removed the doctor told me “you’ll be the first of your friends to have a tattoo.”

I lost touch with the guy over the years as our lives unfolded, but I’ve always had this mark to remember him by. A few years ago, I was at a meeting in Jersey City and I swear it, there he was! I wasn’t a hundred percent sure, so I quietly tried to stare at him and make the confirmation.

A few minutes later, after I’d shared, he made the connection. His face lit up with disbelief. He raised his hand with an inquisitive look and pointed at his finger, as if to say “really? that you man?” I raised graphite marked finger and his face beamed.

After the meeting, we hugged and caught up. He’d been through the wringer with addiction — we both had. But we were both doing better, putting the pieces back together, so much more grateful for what we had on that day, because we knew neither of us deserved it. Since, we’ve run into each other quite a bit. We ran in the same circles, and it was a good place to be.

He died on Oct. 11. This fucking disease got him. A week ago he was posting goofy pictures on Facebook from work, because he had a good job now. There are pictures scattered across his recent history with friends, with his daughter, his girlfriend and his family. He got all of that back. In reality, he deserved all of it, because he worked to get it back. And now he’s gone.

20 years ago I became the first kid in my school to get a tattoo. For two decades it meant little to me, now it might be the most significant tattoo I have. Now, it reminds me that all I have is today, and if I let my guard down or think “I’ve got this” for one damn second, it could all be gone. I’ll miss you buddy, but thank you.",NA
"I have been clean from opiates for over a year. If anyone needs help, reach out to me.
Hi,

I used to be a very heavy heroin user. I kicked it with Suboxone and eventually became completely clean. I've been clean about a year and a half. 

If you could use some advice, have a question, or just want to talk to someone that knows what you're going through, drop me a line.

In the recovery process for opiates, your mind plays a lot of tricks on you. You start to question everything you've ever thought was true. After the initial 3-5 days of intense withdrawal, with all the shitting, vomiting, and leg pain, you get to the mental withdrawals that are the worst part. For about another 8 weeks you still can't sleep regularly and you have no energy or motivation. You can't remember what normal, the way you were before the dope, felt like. So you don't know what are symptoms and what is just normal life. At that point, it's good to talk to someone that's been there. 

Suboxone was less hard to kick than everyone says. I think a lot of the symptoms people talk about from kicking the suboxone are mental. You do feel some stomach pain and lack of motivation for about 8 weeks, but it's much more manageable than heroin withdrawal. That is, if you tapered correctly. I had a huge tolerance for H, when I used I took large doses. However, when I was prescribed two 8mg suboxone strips per day, I only kept to that regimen for the first week. Then, I cut the dose in half everyday until I got to 1/8th of a strip, or 1 mg. I didn't feel any withdrawal symptoms from dropping to that dose. I think with subs, taking more just to keep from feeling the withdrawals aren't necessary. More can put a little more spring in your step for the first week or so, but you don't need them. After a couple years on 1 mg I lowered it to a half mg and a week later to .25 mg. Then I went to .25 mg every other day and finally stopped.

At any rate, I'm here to help...",Recovered
"Habit or addiction?
We all have habits, deeply ingrained behaviors that are hard to change. A habit is specifically defined as “a settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up"" but what makes a habit turn into an addiction?

One of the key indications that a habit is turning into an addiction is the observation of increasingly negatively consequences. A bad habit can have some negative consequences—such as weight gain if you drink too many sodas, or regular tiredness up if you consistently stay up too late watching television.

While these sorts of consequences are unpleasant, they are certainly not life altering. Unlike bad habits, the consequences of addictions are often severe, resulting in serious legal, financial, or relationship issues. An addict may find ways to mitigate consequences, at least for a while, but they will be unable to stop using. This continued abuse of drugs or alcohol, even in the presence of serious negative consequences, is the hallmark of addiction.

Being able to select a drug on the list and learn about the basics, its effects, the law surrounding such substance and even the average dosages are all key factors in being a responsible user.  Knowing how often you can saftely consume a substance before it starts to control your usage is key.  

Does anyone else have any other key resources in their opinions that are  a must? Feel free to share.

"Am I still in the driver's seat?
I've been using meth on a daily basis for the past year. My use started as purely recreational, ordering a gram here and there and binging on the weekends. Soon I was buying eight balls, but my pattern of use changed. Instead of binging for a night or two, I started taking a measured dose everyday and calling it good for the most part. This change in my behavior coincided with my getting into grad school. My rationalization is that I am treating my ADHD through self-medication. I am unable to find a doctor who will prescribe me the meds that I so desperately need in order to function at school and in life. I am not they typical tweaker. I eat three meals a day, sleep eight hours a night, and take vitamins and supplements. Occasionally I stay up all night smoking meth, which makes me feel guilty because of the waste and the dirtiness and fiendishness of it. I try to take breaks to give my receptors a break but I can't seem to go more than five days. I am beginning to wonder if I am a true addict, or perhaps someone who is highly functional and dependent on meth. I'm just putting this out there, hopefully this is the right place. 
Edit: I should add that I use 50-100 milligrams daily. ROA plugging.",Addicted
"Stimulant use
Swim starts college. 

Swim finds stimulants. Swim Likes stimulants. Swim gets doctor to give stimulants. 

Swim abuses stimulants. Swim's life goes into downward spiral. Swim learned the hard way.

Swim still NEEDS stimulants to be productive, as he is working toward a Mechanical Engineering degree at prestigious school. 

Swim wants to be smarter. He usually has summer off to take a break from his dependence and normalize himself, however this summer, no such luck. 

He would like to avoid the ""same mistake"". He knows what it's like to be a rock bottom, and really does not want to return. 

What Swim is hoping the internet can provide is advice on what has worked for them. 

1. Yes he understands the only way to repair all his brain damage is to quit cold turkey, and give it a year or two, while eating healthy, exercising, and getting on a consistent sleep schedule. 

2. Swim doesn't have a spare year or two. He needs stimulants to be productive, because he overused for an extended period of time, never allowing his thinker to recover. 

3. What swim needs is a friend who has ""been there, done that"", someone who has experimented with supplements, nootropics, and/or other drugs. Where he/she has found a ""cocktail"" that allowed them to consume the stimulants they need, while managing the negative side effects to their best of their ability. 

4. Swim knows this is a dangerous game he's playing, however he needs to finish school. 

5. ANY ADVICE GIVEN IS NOT A GUIDE ON HOW TO SAFELY ABUSE STIMULANTS!!! 

TLDR: Swim needs to know the best method to safely consumer higher doses of stimulants, as to minimize any future negative long term effects. Swim is open to any and all ideas.  Please help Swim.  ",NA

"[help] tried meth for this first time sunday night...still feel anxiety
hey guys. so i made a throwaway account for this obviously so i can explain the situation a bit. 
sunday morning i hung out with a buddy who came over to smoke the last bit of weed that i had with me. we chilled and after a while he said he had to go run some errands but that he'd get us some more and come back and smoke later. 
that afternoon he comes back, and says he didn't bring the weed because he couldn't get some, but that he got something else. 
at this point i'd like to point out that the weed we had smoked earlier was really good (also, it doesn't take much to get me high) because i was still definitely stoned, otherwise i know i would've never agreed to do what i was about to do. 
he says he brought amphetamines, and me being a pretty sheltered person from drugs (again, aside from weed) for some reason i assumed he was talking about pills. nope. he was talking about dope. 
he put it in the bowl and heated it up and all that jazz, and we smoked from it. now, i'm not going to lie and say it was bad. it was the craziest rush i've ever had. probably the horniest i've ever been in my life. i took several hits from it because i remember asking him all the time after we'd put it down ""can we smoke more?"" 
that was sunday night. monday went by like a breeze, most of the day i just stayed at home, laying in my bed, i don't even know how i passed the time. he came back to my apartment that night and he didn't have the pipe with him, so he crushed a little bit of it and used part of a broken glass pipe, heated it up and snorted it. i tried but only got a little bit after two attempts. (it burnt my nose and i didn't like it). it was a different high because i didn't feel the crazy rush, mostly i was just tired so i slept. 
fast forward to today (wednesday) and i'm still feeling weird. i feel anxious, nervous. idk, i don't feel like myself. i've been sleeping and eating though. i'm definitely scared because ive been reading a lot about how people get hooked from the first time they try this thing but honestly i don't ever want to be near that. when is this feeling going to go away though? it's been 2 days basically since i smoked sunday night. how long will it take to start feeling like myself again? honestly scared here :( sorry

TLDR; i smoked dope for the first time sunday night then a little bit on monday night and its wednesday and i'm still feeling anxious and jittery. how much longer till i'm not feeling this crap and feel more like myself? ",Addiction-prone

"[HELP Zopiclone]
This is my first time posting here and my first time talking about this to anyone. I try to put this as short as possible, but there's a lot of things I need to mention. I was sexually abused as a child by a relative, and my mother had depression and she became an alcoholic when I was bout 7. There was just the two of us, I have no siblings and my father was in the picture, but he was quite distant to me. He also did some sexually inappropriate things to me since I was 4 or something. On top of all of that, I had childhood rheumatism since I was 2 but it went away by the time I was 9. So, my childhood was never really ""normal childhood"". When I went to school, I was bullied by different people at different times and even sexually harassed by older boys at school when I was 14. I got depressed and didn't go to school, so I went to live with a foster family for a little while. I was 15 then, and started to smoke (topaccos) and drink. I was raped when I was 15 by this older guy and sexually taken advantage by other older guys. 


At one point, I found a boyfriend with whom (and my mother) we moved to another, much bigger city. I started high school there and got all A's. I loved studying. When I turned 18 me and my boyfriend split up and just some months after that I found another guy, who was 35 years old and we started dating and soon I moved to his apartment. I finished high school and after that I got severely depressed again and started to go to a psychiatrist. Years went on, I wasn't in school. I tried to kill myself with my antidepressants several times. My partner was always there for me and my mother, who didn't drink nearly as much and she had gotten her life together, was also. I started to drink way too much, and then at some point I decided to go to a kind of rehab. I stopped drinking and found the joy of life again (for a little while). I applied to university and got to in to study my dream subject. I was sober for years and my studies went almost too well. However, I still wasn't healthy enough to study full time so luckily I got to study as slow as I wanted.I had been diagnosed as having severe depression, dependent personality, and later, after I tried suicide again about 8 years ago, my doctor diagnosed also anxiety disorder and ptsd and prescribed me benzos for my anxiety. I started using benzos everyday, at evenings to take the stress and anxieties away and I'm still using them, even though  managed to decrease the amount by 1/3. I was also in therapy for five years. But I'm not writing about the benzos.


My biggest problem now is sleeping med called Zopiclone (brand names Zimovane and Imovane). I started using them also around 2010, and I also used Zolpidem a little. I got these amazing highs from these meds. It felt like my life has a purpose. That my depression, that has been with me for so long that I can remember, was vanished. Everything was so good, and I was good. Now, I still get Zopiclone (Imovane) every 30 days (I'm supposed to use it 1 per night). I still study, in fact I got my BA last year, which was huge for me. And I got an A from my thesis. My studies are going super well, I get good grades mostly but I'm still able to study on my own pace, so I study kinda slow (I try to get better all the time though, it doesn't always go as planned). I have also been cutting myself since I was a teen, but not for a long time expect last autumn I did it again. I am in therapy at the moment with another therapist.


Back to Zopiclone. Nowadays when the day comes I can buy it, I'm like child on Christmas. For the past year maybe, I've been taking 4 to even 10 pills in the evening, several hours before going to bed. They do not give me the same feeling as in the beginning, but still they do give me the sweet high, when I'm not anxious or depressed about anything. This way, the 30 pills last only a few days, and after that I get a bit more depressed than usual, because I have to wait for another month for the sweet feeling. I'm also very obese, and benzos seem to make me want to eat a lot, but the sleeping pills makes me not want to eat. Lately, I've been going to deep net in my weakest moments to see, if people sell these pills of mine there, like just before I came to write this. Yes, people sell these but the prices are way out of what I could pay. I feel bad, because I should try to get better in therapy for example, but there's no way I can tell her about this. I'm afraid I wouldn't get these pills after that. I feel like I'm trying to balance myself between the public me everyone thinks I am and between this drug addict, who might do something I'll be regretting forever. I keep fantazising, how my sleeping pills would be given to me as anxiety reliever, because that's what they do to me (even the next morning/day they seem to be working). I have never even tried cannabis/hash/whatever, even though I was offered more than once. Also, I do drink nowadays, but once a week only but too much at once though. Could anyone offer some...I don't know, help? Peer support? What on earth should I do?  Sorry for the long post. I've been thinking of writing this for months. Also, English is not my native language, so sorry for any errors. Edit: Sorry, can't get bigger spaces between the paragraphs",Addicted

"Help finding 1980s anti-drug/drinking documentary?
If this question is not appropriate/welcome in this subreddit, please feel free to delete. But since this is addiction prevention education-related, I figured there may be a subject matter expert here who knows. 

Looking for this anti-drug (or drunk driving) documentary video that I saw in 6th or 7th grade health class in 1989 or 1990 in Maryland, USA. Judging by the music and fashion that people were wearing in the video, it had probably been produced in the early-to-mid 1980s however, as everything seemed really out of date to me at the time.

One segment interviewed a teenage boy who I think had been responsible for a drunk-driving crash that killed or injured someone. He looked a little on the dorky side and was wearing glasses - possibly aviators. The only thing I remember him saying something like ""we had a few beers. We had a few bombers"" Or it might have been ""rompers"" or ""uppers"" or ""poppers""? This is the part that has nagged me for the past 30 years.

"Relapse Prevention
Addiction can be an ongoing struggle for many people, even after they complete an intensive treatment program; periodic relapses are not uncommon. Relapse-prevention planning is crucial, then, for maintaining long-term sobriety. In its simplest terms, relapse occurs when an individual abstained from using drugs for any period of time and then use again. This use may be a brief, one-time lapse in abstinence, which is often called a slip, or it may be a binge that involves using drugs in large amounts or repeatedly. In either situation, relapse does not mean an individual cannot get back on the road to recovery. However, it may indicate that underlying issues are not being managed effectively or that an individual could benefit from recommitting themselves to their sobriety. In this training participants will learn the importance of relapse prevention related to treatment and recovery and to recognize the common components of relapse process.

"What to do when drugs is the best thing in life?
Throwaway account because of obvious reasons.

Short bio: smoked hash more or less daily from about 15 to 25. Psychedelics occasionally. Heavy use of speed, pills and alcohol from 20 to 25 Stopped using all drugs cold turkey around 25 because I was just sick of being fucked up all the time. Also had something of a nervous breakdown, due to life circumstances and too much speed. Now, 37 years old. 2 kids. Wife. House in the suburbs. Decent blue collar job. 

This is the problem: nothing beats drugs. I have to say this after 37 years on this fucking planet. I've had my fair share of hot girlfriends and great sex before I settled down. Sex is certainly nice, but afterwards I feel stupid and low. Money, yeah, nice enought, but things doesn't make me happy. Traveling is the closest thing to drugs. I like being in foreign environments, but mostly because it's a new environment to get high in. Doing acid at a beach in Asia is better than doing acid in your bedroom. So what else? Kids. I love my kids to death, but life with kids is mostly a drag. Picking up toys and making dinner and cleaning and trying to juggle work with kids. Stress. 

The only thing in the world, that I've found, that delivers every time, or close to every time, is drugs. Sad but true. It's not that I'm addicted. As I wrote earlier, I quit cold turkey after about 10 years of daily use, and didn't have much of a problem doing so.  When I wanted to quit smoking cigarettes I quit. No biggie. I guess I'm blessed with a non addictive personality, which is great. From about 25 to 35 I was clean. Smoked weed a few times, but not much else.

Now, 37. Kids and wife. Started using dissos, which I highly enjoy. If you would  ask me what was the greatest time in my life, I could lie and say it was when my kids were born, but it's not. My best times when I was on ecstasy on some techno party in the forest, or when I'm traveling strange realms on ketamine. Nothing beats it. It's sad as hell, but I don't know what to do about it. I mostly stay away from drugs, because I have duties, but I'm unhappy. When I see that it's a sunny day, I think 'Man, I wish I could take some acid today.' When I've put the kids to bed, I think 'I wish I could take some K and go to that mechanical wonderworld.' When I fuck my wife I think, 'this is ok, but I wish we would do some e and really get going.'

I'm not sure if I'm venting or what I'm doing, but I would love some input from wiser minds. I could certainly continue living my life as I do, being sober and half-miserable. Or I could embrace drugs and find better living through chemistry. Certainly there is a price to be paid, but yeah... I guess I'm stuck. I can't live the drug lifestyle because of my duties to my kids and my wife, but at the same time, there's nothing I'd rather be doing. Am I addicted? I guess in a sense I have an addicts mindset, but that's only because I've tried drugs, and I've tried the ""normal"" joys of life, and drugs are better.

Sorry for the rant.

Edit: should clarify that the wife hates drugs. She's been okay with me using dissos and dmt a few times, but really doesn't like it. She thinks that I should just put those things behind me as I'm now a dad.

"Being 30+ rules
This is just a chatty shitpost so please feel free to ignore. I'm definitely feeling tender after having a good time Friday night.

Friday night I went out to see STS9 with my husband and a couple of our friends. We're 30-35 and have been around the block enough to know what we like and what our limits are. 2 of us took LSD and a small amount of MDMA, I had a fat ""Borax combo"" (5-MAPB, 6-APDB, a bit of 4-FA, bit of 4-HO-MET), and another friend just had a small amount of MDMA. We would have had fun sober, but it was fun to enhance our evening and make the music a little more sparkly.

People watching was interesting. Saw a few people there who were obviously drug dealers doing business, but the crowd was mostly younger folks (under 30) who appeared to be manageably high or tripping or rolling. 

The whole thing made me appreciate that I haven't gotten addicted to anything and I don't engage in shady/sad things like selling nitrous balloons after shows or wasting the entire time at a concert running around selling/buying drugs. We had a decent hotel room to stay in and responsibly went ""home"" to the hotel after the show after realizing we weren't going to meet anyone good running around Port Chester at 1 AM.

Notably, I spoke briefly with a 22 year old guy who was tripping on LSD and told him we're an ""old married couple"" and he couldn't believe it and said ""you're MARRIED?!"" as if being married is something that only old decrepit people can do.

Festivals are fun and all, but there's something really special about going to a concert or event for a few hours and knowing your limits and sleeping in a bed in a hotel room. :P",Addicted

"Mine and my husband's 4th dance with MDMA
Holy shit you guys. We looked at MDMA all wrong... we saw it, and kinda treated it, as a recreational drug with therapeutic properties... last night taught us that it is a therapeutic drug with recreational, euphoric properties.

90mg for me, 120 for him. We took it after a boatload of vitamins, about two hours after a hefty meal. We drank a small glass of grapefruit juice that morning, but that's all we could stomach of that stuff. 

Despite the food, shit started happening within 20 minutes. I was coming up pretty hard. Him, not so much. We decided to wait it out and see if he just needed patience instead of a booster dose.

We headed upstairs to get naked and touch each other, all that good stuff, as I was rolling pretty good at this point (him still catching up). Almost...too good. I kept getting twinges of anxiety because the sensations were a bit overwhelming at times... overstimulation of sorts. It definitely floored me. 

We decided to give him a 60mg booster dose (half up the nose, half eaten), and while I was measuring it out, I suddenly... just.... nope. Couldn't do it. Floor it was. Literally floored me. I had him finish measuring, and had him eat half and snort the other. It was a few more moments before I was able to get up and go back to the bed. 

It came in waves of incresing intensity... I'd get floored, then I'd be okay, and then floored again, and then okay... You get the idea. At times, it almost got panicky, in a very familiar way that psychedelics get panicky; remember that MDMA has psychedelic properties and *respect them*!

I hadn't realized how much anxiety was holding my experience back; as soon as he told me that he was where he wanted to be, my anxiety vanished and I was able to more thoroughly enjoy the roll. We talked, hugged, fucked, kissed, did nitrous balloons... god.... so many balloons. So. Many. Balloons. Pretty sure most of our footage is just us huffing balloons, lol.

Another thing to note: we set up some cameras in an attempt to capture the magic of the moments. I love watching vids of couples rolling, so why not record ourselves? This becomes ironic later.

Much time is spent just in each other's arms (again, I am floored and talking is a bit difficult during those floored moments), holding each other and being close, enjoying the intimacy. 

Then... a tired feeling crept up on me. ""Shoot. Is it over already? Eh, oh well, that was kinda intense, I'm over it."" I was honestly about to write off the experience as somehwat of a flop (we went into it with recreation in mind primarily, and therapy secondarily), still fun and still had the ""magic"", but the anxiety from being floored was a bummer, plus anxiety about him not being where he wanted to be in the beginning.

We had prepared 12mg 2cb doses for us beforehand; volumetrically dosed and left out for easy access. At this point, I didn't even want it; I was convinced that the ""party's over"" stage had come and the night was largely over. I was just happy to be coming down tbh, as shit was intense.

Our vitamins and 2C-B alarm went off, and I had second thoughts...fuck it. I'll take the bees. Why am I such a party pooper? It really was just anxiety holding me back. The second I got up to change rooms, it was revealed to me that I most certainly was NOT done rolling, not at ALL - set and setting are some SHIT, my guys. 

Here's where the irony comes into play... we head to the bathroom to drink our 2C-B shots and GHB doses (and puffs on our weed vape), and... we stayed in that bathroom for four hours, on the floor, talking about our histories, our pasts, things we didn't even realize we were hiding from one another; it ALL came out.

All those cameras? They missed every second of the real magic. :)

Four hours, literally four hours, just on the bathroom floor; MDMA brought it ALL out of us. We thought we were close and ""knew everything"" about each other before; there's so much shit insecurity prevents you from even realizing you're hiding. All these walls. MDMA WRECKS those walls and barriers, it creates this safe place to just... be who you really are, and love and accept others for who they really are.

THAT is the fucking magic. We went into the experience expecting just some good old recreation with some good talks; when the recreational bit didn't go as planned (I was uncomfortably high at times, he needed a boost), there was definitely some anxiety about ""losing the magic"" already (I wasn't even getting many eye wiggles!), even though it had been eight months since our last roll. When in reality all we needed to do was just... roll with it, let it do its thing, stop fighting the feelings, stop trying to force it, just *roll with it*! Set and setting are SO important!

The addition of the 2C-B and GHB really facilitated what was, effectively, a 6 hour roll. We really nailed it this time. The transition was absolutely seamless and the happiness and empathy there seemed less pushy than in the WHAM recreational ""OMGOMGOMG"" rolling phase, and instead just... so... pure.

Here I had thought that once the main rolling stops, the party's over, but that is so not true. The magic lasts all night, if you can roll with it, if you can get the set, setting, and of course some complimentary chems in the mix. :)

So. Our fourth dance with this chem. A bit of a wonky start, and a bit unexpected (lesson learned: don't expect anything!), but ultimately it's the best experience we have had so far. We were *completely* blown away by just how good, therapeutic, and *magical* the night was.",Addicted

"Visiting Amsterdam over 30? Here's what we learned
I spent a few days in Amsterdam with my wife and we have a few tips for you if you're adults planning to visit that awesome place.
Most of the guides online are targeted to teenagers and party-goers who don't mind sleeping in filthy hotels and smoking in creepy places. But we're in our 30s and we expect a certain standard that was harder to find.

**Moving around:**

There is no free wifi in Amsterdam. You won't get one at Starbucks, you won't get one at McDonald's... Unless you have a sim card from a local carrier, you should prepare your trip to be able to move around while offline.
We did it, and didn't miss having access to internet when in the city honestly.

- Download an offline copy of the city on Google Maps. Even without signal, GPS still works and this will be incredibly useful to know where you are and where you are going.
- Download the ""Amsterdam Public Transportation"" app on the app-store. It is free, it's official, and it contains all the subway, train and tramway maps. This is the only app you really need to move around.
- Skip the free tourist guides on the app-store, most are scams that contain no information whatsoever unless you pay extra.
- You can go everywhere with the tramway, and it's very easy to use once you have the map. Buy a day pass, and don't forget to check in when you enter the tramway, but also don't forget to check out when you leave the tramway!
- If it's your first time in Amsterdam and you're arriving by plane, take a train to Centraal, and from there you'll be able to catch any tramway.

**Tourism**

A lot of places are sold out days in advance. You'll need to get in line for hours to get tickets if you don't book in advance.
But if you buy your tickets in advance, you skip the lin,e get a choice of the visit time, and it's almost much cheaper than buying at the location. Place that get sold out are the Anne Frank House (5h line stretching up to 2 blocks otherwise, and no guaranty to get in), the Van Gogh museum, ...

You can also check with your hotel, as most decent hotels can sell tickets to their clients.

If you want a picture with the **I AMSTERDAM** sign, I recommend getting up early and getting there around 7am. The light is great, and after that it's full of kids, teenagers and tourist climbing all around it. No way to get a decent photo.


**The legal drug scene**

It's not just weed that is legal. Truffles, kana and other drugs are also available legally.

Most coffee shops are very creepy. Dark, dirty, smelly and shitty staff. That was a big surprise, as we visited around 15 coffee shops and couldn't find a single one that was cosy, clean and welcoming. Unless you're into breaking-bad-style drug dens, I recommend you take your weed to go and smoke/vape somewhere else. Avoid places with children obviously, and sit & relax on a bench in front of a canal, in a park or at a terrace of a regular cafe. It is acceptable and common so don't feel bad about it. It's Europe so everybody smoke everywhere anyway.

Coffee shops usually target smokers, and I have found only one who had a vaporizer, and it was very dirty, I gave it back as I wasn't going to put my mouth on that filthy piece. I was afraid it'd ruin the vacation (I really don't enjoy joints) until I found **Azarius**.

If you are like us and don't like to smoke, you can buy vaporizers there. They have every major vaporizers for decent prices, and the staff was awesome, very helpful and very knowledgeable. I bought a vapcap M there, and it made the vacation absolutely awesome. You can use weed + hash in there without issue, the taste and effects are great. Highly recommended.

Do not buy the cleaning product they'll try to sell you tho. $30 for a small bottle is ridiculous, when you can get a 97% iso bottle for less than $2 at any pharmacy. To bring back the vapcap to the US, I just dropped it into the iso bottle, put the bottle in my luggage and that was it. No smell, no residues, no issues.

If you've never taken a truffle before, I highly recommend it. Start with the weaker one (mexicana). It provides a great body high, but will make you anti-social so I highly recommend you take it by yourself, without friends around. It will prevent you from sleeping for hours after the effects are gone, and it will make any food impossible to swallow, so plan ahead, eat before, and enjoy the high in a private setting. I took mine before going to the cinema and it was one the greatest experience I've had with drugs (and I've tried LSD, MDMA, shrooms and weed in the past). It will make you hyper focused and make things more beautiful. I still don't know if **War for the planet of the apes** really was a good movie, but in my memories it was the greatest movie ever made.

Once you have experience the Mexicana truffle, if you are looking for something stronger, I recommend the Dragon Slayer + vaping some sativa. The high was very close to LSD, with a complete loss of the notion of time, sound distortion, vivid colors, and a deep relaxation. I took it in a park after visiting the Van Gogh museum, near dawn, with weed, and saw the clouds looking exactly like Van Gogh paintings. The world became a painting, moving in slow motion, with distorted sounds. Pretty intense. Carry a bottle of water with you, as you'll sweat a lot and get dehydrated extremely fast.

Don't expect to fuck on truffles, you won't be in the mood.

**Food**

Let's be honest. The food sucks and is very expensive compared to the rest of Europe. They mostly cater to drunk & high people, and you can feel it in the service and quality everywhere you go.
So either plan a decent budget to go to upscale restaurants, or prepare to eat a lot of crappy sandwiches, soggy pizzas and low quality pasta.

If you want awesome cheap food, go to France (except Paris, which is also expensive and mostly crappy like most super touristic places).

**Overall**

Amsterdam is a beautiful city and we highly recommend spending a few days there. It was awesome getting high legally, and it's a very relaxing city where you can let go of your stress. There's plenty of things to do for all tastes. It's just missing a decent food culture.

"Vaping DMT
I had previously tried DMT out of an oil burner. While I got some effects, it was tricky getting the right technique with an oil burner. I recently saw this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/6fh53t/super_cheap_guaranteed_breakthrough_vape_pen
 - 
Credit to /u/icbluepeople

---

I was annoyed at myself for rushing out and spending more money, but it looked promising. So, I shopped around and found a good price on ebay. Placed my order and got the pen within the week.

Vaping DMT with this pen was super easy. I tried it last night for the first time. Put 30 mg of powder directly into the ceramic donut coil, tapped the button to melt, then took a long slow 8-10 second draw. Bam! instant trip. Not sure if it was breakthrough yet, but it was close.

Anyway, I'll outline what I got so it's super easy:

Yocan Magneto ~$25 shipped
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=yocan+magneto&_sacat=0

Yocan Evolve Plus Ceramic Donut Coils (CDC) 5 pack with caps ~$23 shipped
http://www.ebay.com/itm/201591143598

So for $50 you have everything you need to vape DMT effectively plus enough coils to experiment vaping other things without cross contamination.

To clarify, the Magneto is the newest pen. The cap and mouthpiece are magnetic, so it's very easy to pop on and off during use. The Evolve Plus is similar and supposedly just as good, but the cap and mouthpiece are screw on instead on magnetic. The Magneto can take the Evolve Plus coils, but the cap that comes with the Magneto coil does not work on the Evolve Plus coils. There is also the Yocan Evolve (not plus). This uses different coils, so be sure you are getting the plus coils.

---

Now, if you want to go even cheaper, you can buy a Yocan Evolve Plus. The Evolve Plus standard coil comes with a cap that works on the Evolve Plus Ceramic Donut Coils, so you don't need to buy the extra caps if you don't want to.
 
Cheapest option:
5 pack Ceramic Donut Coils without caps $12.28 shipped https://www.fasttech.com/products/3007/10025073/5466000-authentic-yocan-evolve-plus-replacement-ceramic

"Report of a drug session for 40+ people.
I am now a 40 year old with a job, wife, career, etc etc. All is good especially considering I was a heroin addict, spent 5 years in prison for dealing mdxx and the usual drug fucked up lifestyle from 11- 32.

I use a little something every 2-3 weeks on a friday night but nothing major and very responsibily. About 3 times a year myself a couple of select friends have a good ""session"". Its well planned with good product and depending on the 3-5 who attend we can have up tp 100 years drug using experience between us. I should add I only drink alcohol if using a stim. It just doesnt interest me.

A few days ago the first ""session of 2017 arrived. I was so excited I posted in drugs that morning and Vaked420 suggested I report back here. The drugs involved were addys, coke, heroin, mdxx, wed, alochol, xanax, diazapam and some cuban cigars. Everything is sourced through connections made through the years. It is all top quality and cost price or free. A couple of us have been in prisonso friends we had years ago who stayed in the game look after us even though we are now people who are not involved in crime and contribute to our communities.

We start with a few drinks and coke about 2pm. It is so enjoyable to drink, snort and tell old stories and adventures to each other. I am sure for other people listening we sound like a bunch of old fogies but to us it brings back smiles, laughs and reminds us of why we loved the drug life.

Next up is the mdxx pil, tested positive for mdma and good reports. I drop and redose 90 minutes later. I love this and spend sometime telling my friends what makes them special and why i love them and why I love my wife so much and how great my Mom is etc. A few joints of top quality green during this period really helps the love rushes orgasm their way through the body.

Next its a little diazapam, and xanax and then out comes the H. Smoking H coming down from mdxx is just such a beautiful thing with the benzos eliminating the nausea. This goes on until 10 am until I am nodding the most euphoric nod one can imagine.

 At this stage we divide a little of everything to ease back to reality over the next few days. As well as this a substantial stash is brought away to a stash spot for the next hurrah.

It is so important for us that we take what we want and not just take what we have. We only get to do this 3 times a year or so but it just gives me such lease of life, renewed sense of well being and energy, focus, connection to the world and positive energy.

The aftermath is easy for me. Plenty of time to relax, good prearation for recovering time, good healthy food and hydration.

I wont lie, recovery time after 40 yrs old even for a 2 day sesh can be slow and tough but with some good preparation and proper sourcing you can make it very easy and even enjoyable.

Love, peace, respect and unity to my fellow responsible friends old and young. Love you all

"I want a more authentic life, but don't know how to get there. Maybe a part one. Bear with me, please.
I'm doing well on paper, my degrees, my licenses, my certifications, my perfect American family of me, a wife, a daughter, and 2 'rescue dogs'. Two German label autos in the drive and a Tesla Model 3 on order. A modest house in a cheapish fun,
desert urban area. I've got gizmos and gadgets a plenty, hoozits and whatzits galore.  And yes, like Ariel, I want more.  Fucking more. 

I've always been into psychedelics and psychedelic culture starting in the 90s. A few awesome trips with friends and I got my nickname while studying pre-med. Started growing shrooms and ordering RCs in '99. Lots of MDMA in those days too. I thought I was living authentically. But I was drowning in hypocrisy. I took a long break for obvious reasons. I took a big dose of my homegrown Golden Teachers in complete darkness and silence in my dorm room over winter break and figured a lot of shit out. Changed schools, did my education, got my shit straight, met my current wife.  We fell in love (probably from mushrooms) and ran away together, to start over and really live. 

Freeze frame, record scratch. How'd I get here? 

Now it's 2017, it's the fucking future. I've carved out a niche, I'm a 'resuscitationist'. I study everything related to acute life-threatening illness I need to know. I can put a tube in every hole and keep your carcass alive, in some crazy suspended animation, for days, weeks, or longer if I need to. I've literally had a 'mostly' dead cardiac arrest patient get up and walk home, then get on the news to talk about how well we saved her life, perfectly normal with no trace of brain damage. I cooled her body to 33 centigrade (91F) for 24 hours to save her brain, and it worked. I donate time to festivals and raves to keep kids safe, this is a passion. 

The work has taken a toll on me. Physically and emotionally. A slipped lumbar disc and a bony growth on T12 that digs into my spinal cord when I get tense. I have a lovely physician, he understands, and he gives me enough to get through the day. Roughly 20-25mg of oxycodone in small divided doses through the day with meals and some extra, that I share (illegally) with my wife who has type II diabetes and needs some pain meds sometimes. It's just enough. Some days I have bad spasms and need a benzo, but he cancelled my diazepam on account of auditing procedures. Fine. Got some etizolam, no worries. 1mg q4 for one day and the spasms relax and my pain is managed for weeks to come. I like to  vape some indica at night. It keeps my oxy dose low. I even popped hot for saliva THC at my doctors office, and he simply never mentioned it. Why would he? We are Professionals in a recreational state and don't ever, ever, work 'high'. Yes, hypothetically I could lose my job for it, but the state has protections in place for MMJ users to protect professional licensure, and why the fuck would I ever willfully submit to a drug test I wasn't prepared for. Drug testing is a Skinner box, designed for clever people to pass and unlucky (using this LIGHTLY) people to fail. 

I got back into psychedelics to seek that special something, that ineffable thing that binds the universe together, and I think I have a good handle on that, but what bugs me is how unauthentic people are day to day. We can't ever say what we truly mean, even though we all feel it. In my trips, I've experienced death and rebirth, the far ends of the human experience. I touched the hand of the Goddess, the one true love-mother-healer-shaman-demon-summoner and slayer. She told me it's gonna be okay, but I still have my battles. 

I want people to be honest. To air their opinions and have rational debates. I live in a house of females and work with a myriad, so rational sense is sometimes off the table. But authenticity is not hard. Just be yourself. I try me best. I hold my patients hand before I put them under, I tell them I will take away their pain, and I do. With IV ketamine and fentanyl infusions and other cocktails, my main goals are maximally aggressive care for cure or comfort, about about 1/3 is strictly comfort, terminal, no chance of meaningful recovery. So I see a lot of deaths, some sudden and tragic, but some so obviously coming and I feel bad. No one should have to suffer in the end, we have to tools for that.  All said, I'm looking into post-grad training in palliative and hospice care, to authenticate the dying experience as a wholesome and natural one. I don't see why I can't provide both services, they are different. 

This is getting long, but this is the spirit of the sub. How do you cope with inauthentic people in your life?  How do you deal with the facade of everyday humans, buzzing about in their consumption and snapchat and insta, and facebook?  I think we are the authentic one,  it afraid of being real. We took the red pill, so yes, how deep does the rabbit hole go??  


Love you guys and gals (including you paging u/MrsGoodtrips) feel free to say hi to the folks here. I love you and they'll support you too.

"Romantic drugs dates!
So my boyfriend had a surprise psychedelic adventure planned for me today, I've had it marked on the calendar for weeks now, even though all I was told was ""just be yourself, and drop a little acid""

Anyway, it turns out what he was taking me to was an art opening that showcased the work of [Thomas Wilfred](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k3__CoJitqI) who was an artist and inventor in the 1920s who made incredibly beautiful art out of light. It's just very trippy and beautiful and reminded me a lot of visuals I've had on mescaline.

It would have been amazing to see 100% sober, but while tripping I was just lost in another world lookong at all the various pieces, they're so hypnotizing.

My boyfriend doesn't trip, but he loved watching it too, but was also quite amused by how into it I was getting, I was definitely out in psychedelic outerspace at that point (I'd taken 250ug of ALD 52 two hours before the museum) and I was definitely getting really lost in the images.

Anyway, it's one of the nicest dates I've ever been on, I thought it was so well thought out and I appreciated how he had it all planned for me.

So just wondering what kind of romantic drug dates other folks are having? (feel free to interpret romance however you like). Or ones that you'd like to do in the future?

Myself and a half dozen other folks who are over 30 and even (gasp) over 40, are renting a house this weekend and doing some drugs.  The main activity is everyone is going to roll Saturday night but we have other supplies as well.

I guess one reason we find ourselves here on Reddit is the need to discuss those things that interest us in a safe and sane environment. Especially where recreational drug use is concerned, this may be something that’s hard to do IRL. The level of mutual trust needed to openly reveal the intimate and illegal details of our drug use is extremely high. Here, that trust is placed in our anonymity. I’m wondering if it is possible or wise to seek such trustworthiness IRL. 

Since the folks reading /r/DrugsOver30 are most likely fully integrated into the working world or, as in my case, retired from it, we may no longer belong to a network of drug-using friends as we did “back in the day.” So how does one safely connect with like-minded individuals in our little towns and neighborhoods?

This subreddit was publicly announced on Feb 15. Within two days, we got almost 800 subs. We're hoping to keep the momentum going.

First, I'd like to introduce myself.

I'm the founder and currently only mod. I'm a tech professional in my 40s. I'm married, and have three young kids. I grew up during the ""Just Say No"" era, and never was really exposed to anything harder than pot. In my late 30s I was introduced to recreational substances like MDMA and LSD. These substances (along with several others) have made a huge positive impact in my life. There are several subreddits that have helped me get educated about drugs like /r/Drugs and /r/DarkNetMarkets among others. Those subs have been invaluable. But those are subs that I often use to search for content that I need, and then get out. What I'm hoping to build here is a community for adults to discuss not only drugs, but also life, with an open mind and good will. Also, it doesn't matter if you are experienced with drugs or not. As long as you're open minded about their use.

Due to the nature of this subreddit, we should all exercise caution not to reveal too much personal information, but I would love to hear about who you are, and what you hope to get out of this sub.

Also, if you're interested in the demographics of the sub, I would love for you to take out survey. It's anonymous and very simple. Interestingly, so far, we are more than 50% under 30, which is fine. I'm more interested in people who want to build a community rather than any specific age.

Here's the **[survey](https://goo.gl/forms/nPtxjxtl1jlMEkbE2)** and the **[results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOB77OadKoweXjCcWy9TK8q0w2NInxUDO_20jWd90rlyTQSw/viewanalytics)**

The original welcome thread is **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugsOver30/comments/5ubsii/how_did_you_get_here/)**

If you commented before feel free to comment again, or not.

Thanks for joining in!

\* Oh also maybe state if you're not in the US. Not a requirement, it's just easy to forget that not everyone on reddit is in 'murica.

"Welcome - still figuring our who we are.
I think most (not all) subscribers to /r/Drugs know that there are all ages here, and that younger folks need a place to get good information. So, I would never discourage anyone from posting in /r/Drugs. I also don't want to pull experienced users away from /r/Drugs because it's a good community. That being said, sometimes I just want to have a quieter place to talk amongst more mature and/or experienced folks. So... I started up /r/DrugsOver30

You don't actually need to be over 30. It's like the difference between /r/Sex and /r/SexOver30. Ideally you're an adult with your life together. Folks who use occasionally and are more interested in life than in drugs... but happen to also like drugs. Anyway, it's brand new. It may or may not work out. Let's see.

Since this is new, I don't know 100% what content should or should not be allowed. I will probably delete posts pretty aggressively. I am open to ideas though.

In an nutshell, though, it's not for the high schoolers asking if it's ok to smoke weed everyday. It's even for the college kids abusing adderall, or wondering if it's ok to take molly every weekend. That's what /r/Drugs is for. This is for folks who ~~have their shit together and~~ are looking to drugs to enhance life, not fix it.

Risky behavior is discouraged, harm reduction is encouraged. Noob questions are ok, but within reason.

"On a break from weed. Day #1. Restless and strong cravings. Any advice to get it under control?
Hi,

I vape weed every day for years and at this point I don't even get high anymore, I just get ""not sober"" unless I vape a full gram of shatter at once.

So it's time for a tolerance break.

1st day today, and holy shit I wasn't expecting such strong cravings.

My last T break was over a year ago and it was hard, but not that hard from day 1.

Any advice to keep the cravings under control for a bit? I'm at the office and I'm restless, can't focus on anything. I just want to vape and get back to a relaxed focused state that weed usually provides...

"Avoiding alcohol?
I sell mushrooms so I basically have an unlimited amount, my friends like eating mushrooms and hanging out.

I'm an alcoholic in the sense that all 6 arrests and 4 convictions were alcohol related. I have no problem going out to a bar, concert or music festival and not drinking. I'll stay sober or eat mushrooms depending on whether I'm the DD or not.

I hate being looked at differently bc I'm on mushrooms having fun while my friends are all spending $60-$100 alcohol and talk about hating it the next day when I'm up ready to go workout the next morning.  

I'm the weird guy bc I'd rather eat some mushrooms (about $10 worth of my selling price) and dance, wake up refreshed and go work out in the morning

"Lets talk about testing.
I seem to get the general vibe over at /r/Drugs that people just trust their dealer or their friend or the random guy that gave them something at a rave that it is what they said it is. I expect more maturity and caution from the over-30 crowd. 

When you get something new (even from a trusted source), how many of you test it?  Do you own a test kit? How many times have you found something to be not what it was sold to you as?

I had a friend give me a baggie of what she was told was ""Molly"" (looked like about 2 GRAMS, holy shit!) Tested it 3 times to be sure and since there was plenty of it... some from the powder and some from the crystal and it turned out to be bath salts. Fucking bath salts. I gave it back to her and told her to do whatever she wanted with it, but I'd suggest flushing it.

"Legalize all drugs?
If you had asked me four years ago if all drugs should be legal, I would have dismissed it as a Libertarian thought exercise. But I've heard some really good arguments for it. The idea is not to encourage use of any and all drugs, but to decriminalized it so people can get help if they are using dangerous drugs, and people can get access to safe supplies of drugs that aren't so dangerous. There could be financial benefit, public safety benefit, recreational (duh), and even medical/therapeutic benefits.

Here's some food for thought:

"Tips to replace coke?
So I've been using coke with my wife every couple of months for the past year and just had what we plan to be our last blow out on Saturday.  Went to crazy club, did around a gram between us over the course of the whole night but had the weekend away from the kids so we had time to recover. Plan is now to quit for a couple of years. We want to be clean for 3 moths then try for a baby, then once the new baby is over 1 yr old to go back to coke (using 3 or 4 times a year in a sensible way). To be honest the main reason we like coke is for the improvement to our sex life! We fuck like teenagers when we are on it (rather than a married couple with kids in their late 30s). Before we started doing coke we had a lot of arguments which probably stemmed from mismatched sex drives/crap sex (compared to what we had before kids), but coke sex (with a little help from viagra) has been awesome! Like I said we only used once every 8 weeks or so but it was worth the wait and really put the mojo back into our relationship generally. I'm really quite upset about having to stop now but want to make sure we don't damage our or our future Baby's health so am determined to stop. 
Anyone had a similar experience? Any tips on how to cope? Or anyone who used coke before pregnancy who then had a baby with/without any problems? Any good ideas on replacements for coke? I'm thinking a bit of weed and alcohol- not great for those trying to conceive either but I'm guessing once a mth should be ok, and not as bad health wise as coke.

"2C-B is the best drug for art exhibitions
A few days ago I went to a pretty great piece of art. The description reads like this.

>	SKALAR is a large-scale art installation by Christopher Bauder and Kangding Ray which explores the complex impact of light and sound on human perception.

I immediately realized that I wouldn’t want to go sober. For events like this psychedelics are great. However since there are lots of sober people and even children it can also be a challenge. So I tend to choose psychedelics with a relatively weaker headspace compared to LSD or magic mushrooms. I have tried 4-HO-MET, AL-LAD, and 2C-B for this purpose. Of these 2C-B is by far the most comfortable and social one in my experience. So I decided on 20 mg of 2C-B orally.

Have a look at [some impressions of what it was like.](https://youtu.be/GhRqriVTwxM) Pretty cool, don’t you think?

The exhibition takes place in a huge former industrial building with concrete pillars and a very high ceiling. It’s kind of gloomy since there’s no light besides the sculpture and the signs to the emergency exit. This suited us extremely well since people won’t look at our saucer sized pupils.

The sound and lights are extremely well done. Even a sober friend says she experienced synesthesia. It sucked us in and hypnotized us.

There are several parts as you can see in the video. I didn’t take a picture of all parts. Some of the best are missing. It takes about 40 minutes to complete once and repeats afterwards. 

We spent four hours watching it from different places in the gigantic hall. After a while we recognized the structure and gave the different parts names like sun, ocean, thunderstorm, and dragon. The crowds didn’t bother us in the least. We even increased our dose by snorting another 10 mg and added some cannabis from a vaporizer. If they hadn’t closed we would have stayed even longer I’m certain.

So go to your local art exhibitions and take some drugs to enhance the experience.",Addicted
"How do you justify your use?
There's no proof one way or another that drugs are safe or harmful, and more than likely it's much more complicated and dependent on each unique situation. Personally, I feel that if drugs are ever interfering with my goals, health or relationships, instead of being a positive influence, I reassess my consumption. Sometimes though it's easy to just worry that I'm blinded by my own mindset. Writing down anytime I use anything has been very helpful to me to keep track.

When I was 38 I did some methamphetamine for about 6 months and I thought I was addicted so I found an addiction psychiatrist. I left her office with prescription for GHB, Amphetamines and several other things. What I left behind were the evil meth people that were the problem all along. Looking back I realized I was lonely and using drugs made me popular that is until i ran out. Basically I opened myself up to some cruelty. People could tell how lonely i was and loved stealing from me. Since then I've learned to be alone. Drugs with people you trust are fine because you watch each other even enjoy each other. Strangers no thanks. I have no way of doing it anymore but when I do it'll be alone for sure. Although I think I want to do DMT and I keep screwing it up.

"Casual heroin use.
Hi guys. Just wanted to say a few things, and hear some thoughts, but what do you guys think of casual heroin use?


I feel like I am part of a unique group of [people,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQlzzV80y8E) that use heroin, but follow strict rules as to not get out of control. We use it as a medicine to improve our lives! Like pennicillin or opium.


joking aisde. I used to be daily user for over 12 years, and recently got clean after a year.  I found life to just suck after getting clean, like nothing got better.


I decided I'd start trying to use every now and then, I do strict to a rule,  only on my days off, which makes it so at most I can only use once every 3-4 days. But often times once I use that week, it subverts my cravings for more then 3-4 days. But I've been doing this for months, there are times where I want to break my rule, and use a second day in a row, and it results in my flushing dope.

IDK what scares me more, going back to having to deal with withdrawels and coping....or the sad, boring depressing life that 100% sobriety was.


I've tried just about everything, but this sort of walking the fine line, has brought back some pleasure in my life, and balance, even got a job.

**The command to get drug information:**

>~drug <substance> <property>

By default, this command will return all information on the substance. This can be kind of spammy, so one can use a property to define what kind of information they want to receive. Properties include: dose, onset, duration, after-effects, summary, detection, aliases, marquis and categories.

For example you could say:

>~drug mdma dose

TripSitBot will respond with dose information for MDMA.

**The command to get combo information:**

>~combo <substance1> <substance2>

Using this command, you will get information on this combination of substances. For example you could say:

>~combo dxm mdma

"My 1st 4 of 8 life-changing ayahuasca ceremonies in PERU
M, 18 and 20(at the time of these experiences) So I went to two ayahusca retreats in Peru, doing 4 ceremonies through 7 days ( so total 8 ceremonies ) litterally emptied my bank account to do so, both times and it was so worth it. After seeing the ''DMT:The spirit molecule'' documentary, I felt very compelled to the phenomenon of DMT and I made my way to KAPITARI, which is the name of the healing center in peru I went to (If you ever want real good shamanS and a great community that really makes you feel you are welcome and loved, part of the family, go there ! Also, mostly adults 30+ there)

And so, well I went there and it was a profound life changing experience, and since I am now 21, I would say also this is pretty distant in the past, so I'll jump really to the learnings that struck me the most(my conscious mind) even tho I know deeper changes, even forgotten, got carved into my soul.

1. Contrast between ups and downs, difficult and blissful moments is what makes things so much more beautiful and intense ; worth living and so, let yourself live them fully, whatever you judge them to be (good,bad,etc...) Here's how this came about :  

   1. \-First night of ceremony, I felt like I was dying for the first 2 or 3 hours because I was just feeling so harsh physically, sweating tons and tons. I was advised not to drink too much water and I felt I was gonna dry up and die really. Until I asked one of the facilitators (Trip sitters sort of, there were 2) if I was gonna die. After explaining to him everything (sweating, ill feeling, purging vomit, diarrhea and all) he suggested I either take more (not an option to me at that point, or so I felt) or drink a bit of water and just let ''mother ayahuasca'' do her work. After, during the most intense and difficult moments of my life, reaching the 99.9&#37; intolerable (hard purge), things settled and I started to see everyone that loves me and and whom I loved back flashing by at an insane rate, backwards in the chronological order of my life until I was nothing but the essence of myself. And at that point I was reborn into my 18 years old body like a baby, into pure bliss. At that point I re-explored each of my senses, astonished by the complexity of each one of them and thought to myself like ''There must so many things like this, infinitely complex, around us and we just assume we know already and walk by, not paying ANY attention to an incredible profoundness where you usually assume shallow-ness'' I could basicly find everything in anything, anywhere, anytime. (Similar to a place I've been on my best mushroom trip, where I was everywhere and nowhere, forever and never, simultaneously) Anywho, I bathed in this pure love for hours before falling asleep to the most realizations-filled and unique dreams.

And then, in-between ceremonies in 1st week : Arts lady with a painting interpretation (quite a learning on myself and harsh truths), fruit baths, plant baths, fun times listening to other people's experience around me, shaman meetings, plant eating, dancing with naked tribals and more. A truly transformative experience.

I am 21 today and just recently one of my close friends explained to me how much I had changed after that experience 3 years ago, and how that's actually when I started having an impact in his life and so how he noticed me being around him, leading to a friendship I am profoundly grateful for. When I look back, I feel so lucky to be me, alive, passionate about everything I do and confident in knowing I love what I do and do what I love (parkour coach/stuntman/musician/philosophy and psychology). I see so many lost 20, 30 and even 40+ years old in life that really never took the time to find themselves, and they're quite a large fraction of the population from my experience (I'd say approximatively 40-50&#37;). And so yea, ayahuasca is something I'd love to be able to give out, or throw at some people, but I've also learned that what is good for me can be harmful to others. At any rate, if you feel curious/desperate/in need of healing, I 100&#37; would recommend this over any expensive psychologue/pharmaceutics or w/e.

\*\*re-read commentary : I just noticed and remembered how much during the experience I could notice how being me would have an impact on people around me and so ''me'' was important way beyond myself. Taking care of me is taking care of others in a way. It is also a form of respect towards those you love to take care of yourself the way they would.

(at this point I've been writing a while and being this tired (and slightly weed high) I guess I'll leave the other few stories of the other ceremonies for another time. If anyone would be interested in reading those, let me know and definitly also tell me about your experiences with ayahuasca and what it brought you)

"Wife is ~6 weeks pregnant. Interested in stories from other casual drug using couples.
My wife and I are turning 30 this year - drink most weekends, roll about 4 times a year, do cocaine a couple times a month, and otherwise moderately enjoy ourselves.  We've decided to try to have a child and succeeded on our first go through.

Although I in no way consider our level of use addiction, I know it's going to be really hard for my wife to abstain during social interactions for the duration of her pregnancy.  I'm positive it would be even harder if I was partaking in her presence (or even really outside of her presence - FOMO).

Any thoughts/advice from other couples about how this side of the pregnancy was handled?  Obviously there are way more pressing concerns for us than drug use right now, but it's a facet of our lives that will be changing, and I think y'all might be a good resource.

"Hippie-flip: can anyone offer any guidance?
Hello lovely people. My friend/rolling partner wants to hippie-flip next week. It's been years *(and years and years...)* since I've done shrooms. I'm very open to the idea of the mdma/shrooms combo, but I have some questions:

-- How long does the combined trip/roll last? Is it still about 7-8 hours from initial ingestion to feeling somewhat normal? (I've got kids; timing/scheduling is important.)

-- I've seen varying advice about dosage and timing (shrooms first vs. mdma first, how long to wait between taking the first and the second substance). What have you guys tried, or what do you recommend?

-- My favorite part of rolling is the sensual experience—I want to touch all the things. Do the shrooms negate this aspect, and skew the trip toward the visual? 

-- If I decide to stick with mdma only while my friend does both, will we be out of sync in a way that will make it less fun for both of us?

-- Is there a different supplementation regimen that's recommended? Or stick with the usual rollsafe recs?

"God DAMN 2C-B is powerful.
I dropped 2C-B with my husband last night; this is his second time doing bees, while this is my... nth time doing bees (I've used it quite a bit as it's my favorite drug in the world). We took 16mg each. I am sensitive to bees, and 15mg will have me tripping pretty good, while he is more tolerant and mostly gets physical and mental effects without much visual effects.

Not sure if this had any effect on it, but the day before yesterday, I did use 15mg of noopept in the morning. Perhaps it intensified the experience? I know the half life of noopept is short but last night's experience was *so* intense, I can't help but wonder if it had any effect.

Anyway. Just. Wow. WOW.

Everything was dialed up to eleven. Similar to MDMA, you know how your eyes will involuntarily roll back into your head? Well, it wasn't rolling back into my head that my eyes were doing, but everything was just so intense that I'd have to close them and just take it all in. The sex was incredible; reaching orgasm was difficult but incredibly pleasurable, I kept thinking I was close to orgasm because it couldn't possibly get even more pleasurable but it just kept CLIMBING and BUILDING in intensity. The final result was amazing and fucking exhausting, lol. Music was amazing. The euphoria was out of this world. The visuals... incredible. Everything was ""4D"". I felt like I existed in infinite dimensions. Tactile enhancements were ever present, and boy, was I feeling the LOVE.

I feel like after all my experiences with bees, this was the first one that really allowed me to ""get"" 2C-B. Like. I GET IT, now.

A lot of parallels are drawn between 2C-B and MDMA, and many users brush it off, saying they're completely different and not comparable other than extremely broad generalizations. Until last night, I agreed. But last night. Man. It *definitely* felt like trippy-E. Not exactly the same, no. Definitely not as pushy. But certainly comparable in terms of sheer euphoria, levels of empathy, and feelings of love.

Just, holy fuck you guys. I fucking love 2C-B. More than LSD, more than MDMA, it's just SUCH a good drug. It's so versatile! You wanna ""roll""? 2C-B can do it! You wanna trip? 2C-B can do it!

God, what a beautiful drug MDMA is. 85mg for me and 116mg for him, with an 8mg dose of 2cb at the 4 hour mark, right as we were sharply dropping off the peak. Peak roll effects lasted about 2.5-maybe even 3 hours; we took it on empty stomachs and supplemented as per rollsafe.org's instructions circa November 2016 or so? Think that's what I have written down.

We talked, cuddled, kissed, fucked, pet the dog (sooooo sooooft!), had a cool shower, enjoyed music, typical E stuff! God, kissing on E is the *best* thing ever. If I spent an entire roll making out with my husband, I'd be 100% okay with that.

I gotta say that without the MD redose, the hangover is much much easier to handle; the day after I felt tired, but not stupid, just tired. Honestly felt great aside from the exhaustion, and today I feel pretty much baseline. The duration of the roll, while maybe 30 minutes shorter than when we boosted, didn't actually *feel* shorter - we didn't have crazy time compression (OR jaw tension for that matter). When the main roll ended, it was okay, we weren't upset about it, it felt alright, even despite the effects I'll describe in the next paragraph.

The comedown off the drug itself did seem a little... sadder than last time (where we had a booster), I got twinges of sadness and anxiety in my chest around the time we decided to take the bees, and I even started thinking ""fuck, I'm so tired, I just want to sleep, not trip, FML"", but the twinges were ephemeral. Once the 2cb kicked in, the sadness and anxiety COMPLETELY dissipated and were replaced by a noticeably lifted mood, and things because ever so slightly trippy, with fractal closed eye visuals, strange dreamlike ""visions"" (NOT CEVs), and very mild open eye tracers. Tactile enhancement was also brought back slightly, and sex + orgasm was not only possible but very good! (MD sex was possible but a little... Floppy hehe.)

The transition to 2cb was SEAMLESS. No comeup at all. Just, boop, bees land. It was very cool!

By hour six or seven or so we were beginning to fall asleep, even with the active 2cb in our veins.

8mg was definitely very small and a little underwhelming for me but since he's not nearly as experienced as I am with psychedelics, we didn't want to trip balls, and I didn't want to be up tripping/rolling while he slept, so we decided to start low and dose up if we wanted to; we ended up just wanting to sleep, lol.

Next time I think I'll do 15mg 2cb at the end. I can absolutely see how it brings the roll back! Fuck I love 2cb haha.

Anyway, it seems like redosing/boosting MDMA brings me more trouble than it's worth; I think I'll ""boost"" with bees from now on! A much cleaner experience for sure, even if it's a little less ""POW!"" than my first time/with the redose. It certainly felt way less toxic, and I can't help but wonder what the 2cb does pharmacologically with the MDMA. It really does ""kill"" the comedown. Is it just drugs being drugs, or is it mitigating some toxicity? Or worsening it... haha. Who knows! I just know I feel super today.

I hope y'all had as lovely as weekend as we did, lovelies. <3",Addicted
"MDMA + Depression - The latest update
My wife has been going through a bout of depression. After several months, she started on Wellbutrin. She’s been on it for about a month. The last time she did MDMA was four months ago with a few good friends. She was in depression then, and not on medication. All the friends dosed moderately at 100mg, with no re-dose. Some of them rolled pretty well, but two of them, including my wife, had very mild effects. She has previously rolled fine on as low as 85mg. The week following the roll, she felt slightly more depressed than before. But we weren’t sure if this was comedown hangover, just her depression progressing, or perhaps because she was somewhat let down by the expectations of her time with her friends. The last time she was in depression (a year ago), we had rolled two times. Both of those previous rolls, she had a temporary mood lift for the following week.

Anyway, we were now debating whether or not to roll now. She’s been a little gun shy because of last time and also having just started on Wellbutrin a month ago. After doing a good amount of reading about people’s experience with rolling on Wellbutrin and taking into account her previous rolls while in depression, we decided to give it a shot, hoping that the last time negative comedown was not directly a result of her roll.

So last weekend, we rolled. Plugged 115 mg for her, and 140 mg for me. This was the first time plugging for either of us. I’ve plugged many different substances. I can say objectively that there is no causticity or irritation from the MDMA. I dissolved the crystals in a shot glass with 0.9 ml of warm water from a 1 ml syringe. The crystals dissolved easily. Come up was around 30-45 minutes. Peak was around 60-90 minutes. I was expecting it to hit harder with the rectal dose, but we both had relatively mild rolls. Still good, and stronger that her last roll, but not mind blowing. Started feeling comedown after 3-4 hours. I would call plugging a success. It does reduce some of the uncertainty around gut load and timing of food consumption.

Now for the best news. The last few days we’ve had a very positive afterglow. No negative comedown. And to put a cherry on it, she’s had a huge libido boost.

tl;dr On the fence about rolling while in depression. Rolled. Went great.",Addicted
"20ug LSD microdose report
Spontaneously decided to have a little microdose on my day off today. I inaccurately took about 1/12 of a 200ug candid, which in hindsight was probably closer to 300ug. So really my microdose was anywhere from 12ug up to maybe 30ug haha. I'd guess about 20 though. And I honestly gotta say it's turning out really amazing. I didn't know really what to expect, but it's really been nice. I'm at about t+5:00 and have been consuming some cannabis, microdosed as well and it's just a great day off. Now I'm with my fiancé having some sexy time and it is literally amazing. I feel so connected to her and am having just a wonderful day.

"Unexpectedly therapeutic pro-social and empathogenic effects from dextroamphetamine
As the title says - husband and I decided to have some fun with some dextroamphetamine pills today. He had never tried good ole amphetamine before, just MDMA and 4-FA, so I suggested we take the opportunity before the school semester starts next week (we work in academia, so this weekend will be our last ""drug weekend"" for a while).

I took 10mg and gave him 20mg with 5 and 10mg booster doses approximately two hours later.

I explained to him what to expect from amphetamine: you'll feel mildly to moderately euphoric, chatty, horny, and you'll just feel like doing stuff and will enjoy doing whatever; I mentioned it's a great opportunity to tackle some boring chores. I also fully expected to just fool around sexually all day (he took Cialis to counter the stim dick).

NOPE

Instead, we literally spent *the entire day* hanging out and talking, with light make out sessions and fooling around interspersed (but we still talked the whole time, lol). But really, we just talked each other's heads off and told stories *ALL fucking day*.  It was honestly reminiscent of the kind of deep, vulnerable talks that happen on MDMA. We talked about everything, from our pasts to our friends to our families to politics to dogs to kids to music to food, just, fucking all of it, but focused on the more personal stuff. 

It was great. We were able to talk about heavier issues that typically trigger insecurities/anxieties in ourselves, again much like MDMA but obviously not as pushy or euphoric. 

So. Yeah. That took us both by surprise. Who knew that dextroamphetamine could be emotionally and interpersonally therapeutic, who knew it could work kinda like MDMA in bringing people closer together?

Fuckin' rad, y'all.

As I sit here feeding a grumpy baby and one-handedly type on my iPad, I’m wondering how others balance the demands of “grown up life” with drug use...

For example, I won’t take drugs if I’ve got to drive within the coming three days.  Thats because:

a) I fear the cost of unexpectedly prolonged impairment could be injuring my family
b) I live in London so have plentiful public transport, and
c) the British police drug test thresholds for prosecution are incredibly sensitively low, and no driving licence equals bad for a family dude.

In fact, its been a quite a while since I indulged, due to family needs, but I’m still thinking ahead to the next chance, which may not be for months, but hey, that’s life.

"Trip Report: MDMA after 20+ years
**Tl; DR:** Took MDMA for the first time in over 20 years. It was good, but not as physical as I remember. How to get that physical feeling back next time?

I posted a [couple of weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugsOver30/comments/5usqq3/doing_mdma_next_week_for_the_first_time_in_years/?st=izv5cvmh&sh=23257c22) with my plans to take MDMA for the first time in a long, long while. I tried to figure it out, and it had been at least 20 years. Here's how it went...

**Safety/dosage:** After I saw the pills (I hadn't seen them when I posted before) I was able to look them up—blue “laugh now, cry later”. The reports were good, but I tested one anyway. My first time using those reagents, I used all four, and the color change confirmed that the pills contained MDMA. We had been warned that they were a high-dose pill, and the [pill reports](http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=36524) said the same thing. I took a rough half—the smaller half, there’s no split line, and it didn’t cut cleanly. (Next time maybe will crush to a powder so it will divide more evenly.) 

Took magnesium before (6hrs before dosing, then again 2 hours before) and after coming down. Ate vitamin-c-containing fruits and veg during (red bell pepper, kiwi, pineapple). Drank some coconut water and some regular water but did not measure how much. Had a glass of wine that night. 

**Logistical details:** I needed to do this during the day, while my kids were at school. They each had play dates, so I was free from 9-5. I let people know that I'd be out of cell range, and any problems or concerns should be directed to my mom. We drove to the beach (about a 30-40 minute drive), spent the day there, and I was home to pick up kids exactly on time.

I took the half-pill around 10am, didn’t look at the clock to see how long it took to come up, or how long the initial peak lasted. I took another small bit around 1:30. I was mostly down by 4pm.

**How it felt, what we did, some questions:** It was very mellow. Gentle. Lots of talking, lots of holding. We were at the beach, lying on a blanket in the sand dunes. It was about 60º outside, maybe a little warmer, but also breezy. Sitting up it was too chilly, lying down with the protection from the wind, the sun felt wonderful.

It wasn’t as physical or visual as I remember from before. What I remember from doing X in the 90s was the intense amount of physical pleasure; that was my favorite part, and what I was looking forward to again. I used to love, especially during the first peak, feeling on the edge of having an orgasm just from someone stroking my skin or running their hands through my hair. But it wasn’t like that this time. Physical contact felt good—holding hands, lying down wrapped up with each other—but I didn’t have any desire to put my feet in the warm sand or pick up a pile of beach pebbles to fondle. I had brought a hairbrush, thinking how wonderful it would feel, but I had no desire to take it out and use it.

The lack of visual I can understand—it was daytime, and we were in the sunlight. 

I noticed the lack of speed, or whatever amphetamines X used to be mixed with. I didn’t want to walk—too bad, because that beach was made for walking. It was almost *too* mellow. That night, and the next day, I did notice the effect of the jaw-clenching I must have been doing. At the time I didn’t know I was clenching, but my muscles are still sore, two days later.

I want that physical feeling back when I do this again next month. Do you think it wasn’t so physical because it was daytime? Or because it was too cold outside? Would it have been better at night? I don’t think I can pull off a night without my kids, so next time will probably be another daytime roll. I’m thinking maybe at home with the shades drawn would be better—that way we could take clothes off if we wanted (more skin!), we’d be warm, we could have music… We wouldn’t have the connection with nature or the beauty or the textures of plants or sand, but maybe that’s ok.

Or is it just that MDMA is not the same as the X I was taking back then? Has the drug changed, or is it different that the speedy X I was probably getting before?

Not too long ago, I did DMT out in the woods. I had taken two big hits and was staring at the stars. I watched them join together and shimmer in the sky.

I was watching an HBO documentary on addiction (forgot the name) the other day and a doctor said something that made me think of this sub.  He basically said that if you weren't addicted to anything by the time you were 30, you almost certainly would not become an addict.  The VAST majority of addictions are started between the ages of 16 and 25.

I know nothing is guaranteed, especially in addiction, but this does kind of make sense to me.  I didn't start experimenting until I was in my late 40s and I feel like I have a lot more maturity to recognize and deal with things that might lead to addiction.  It is a lot harder to lie to myself, I guess.  I see some of the behavior of some of the 20-somethings on /r/drugs and it seems almost alien how irresponsible some of them are.

I believe the line between recreational use of a substance and medicinal use of a substance is very blurry. I often times see recreational use more so as a subset of medicinal use as essentially fun medicine.

I don't need cannabis or drugs to make me feel good, in fact they rarely do make me feel good, but they help me get to a state where I can have fun, and more often times than not, that relaxation leads to a lasting positive impact on my life. I'd see my use of drugs as both recreational and medicinal as its for fun, but therein lies the medicine.

"Another night with 'Abby'. 115mg of 6-apb fumarate for me and the wife.
It's been a little over a month since our last roll on 6-apb, and while we really wanted to wait a little longer, timing just wasn't working out. We dosed 115mg of the washed fumarate version at 5pm, and immediately sat down to a small meal of beef and salad. We both ingested 10mg oxycodone prior to dropping as well. 

T+1:30- I'm feeling a little flutters starting and I put the kid to bed. She's exhausted, yeah it's early but she can't stay awake. I come downstairs and wife has just vomited, and is already rolling hard. She's not nauseous, it was just a rapid come up for her, odd. I take 400mg magnesium and some ALA at this time, but she can't swallow the huge pills. 

T+2:30- we are both rolling super hard right now, everything is flowing great. Amazing conversations and some real mental work. We both feel great, I'm dancing around the room to some String Cheese Incident and she's totally floored but talking with ease. This peak lasts for the next 5 solid hours. I love that Abby isn't pushy like MDMA, it doesn't smack you in the face and force you to roll, you roll with it, at your own speed. We vape some dispensary indica periodically and it strengthens the roll, and adds to the visuals. Strobing, shifting, color enhancement, some pattering over surfaces. It's lightly psychedelic, and I really enjoy that. We are currently working on a little bit of an 'awakening' in my wife after our last two 4-aco-met trips, her outlook on life is getting better and she's being more honest with herself, ignoring her ego more. This is like a year of therapy in 5 hours. 

T+7:30: the fluency of speech and empathic push is dwindling, cannabis helps, but we also take another 10mg oxycodone and it makes everything feel awesome again. We have sex and climax together which is mind-blowing. The roll is definitely fading and some stimulant symptoms are creeping up, muscle cramps, vasoconstriction. We each take some more magnesium and ALA to offset some of this. 

We continue to talk and enjoy the body load and visuals until around T+10h, and take 2mg etizolam because it is getting really late and a few hours of sleep would be nice. She manages to fall asleep fairly quickly,  but I'm pissing like a racehorse every 20 mins. I get about 2 hours of tweaky sleep before my daughter wakes me up to start the day. I'm pretty miserable, still have dilated pupils and vasoconstriction, but all I have to do is get her to the bus stop.  She behaves super well and I get back to sleep around 9-11:30 am. Feeling pretty tired today, but that's unavoidable. Took some high CBD edibles and some decent food, and we will make it through the day. Too tired to process the experience much, but it was very satisfying. 

6-abp is one of my favorite substances ever, and now after the second time, it just confirms this. We will try to take a longer break until the next roll, but this compound is incredibly useful for fun and therapy and it's just amazing to have easy access to such a pure product.

"Last night we repeated the 30mg 4-Aco-MET experiment from last week. It went really well...
I know I ramble on, but this one was fun. Wife and I ate a dinner of picadillo and potato with our usual 7.5 mg oxycodone and 40mg propranolol around 5pm. Put my daughter to bed at 1900hrs. 

1930: plugged 30mg metacetin each. 
1940: very fast come up, getting heavy and starting to wobble, visuals present.  
1950: wife says ""where can I leave my body?"" She meant like where could she lay down, but she felt she was about to leave her body for this experience. I had put on an Umphrey's McGee live show [6/7/13](https://youtu.be/CnOG1QMq5zE)Red Rocks, CO. One of the greatest shows they've ever done. We laid down near each other on the couch and let go.....

From this point until about 2130, we experienced full level 8a geometry and the most insane full body orgasmic euphoria that coincided with the epic jams of Umphrey's. It felt like Brendan and Jake were taking us on a sexual fantasy while basically laying motionless in the abyss. The lead guitar was like literally making love to each of us. We were dominated by the music, every emotion and feeling just brought more and more pleasure. The Mrs and I were kinda caressing each other, but couldn't really move. I felt her orgasm several times during the peaks of the jams. I didn't physically orgasm, but had full body euphoria for the whole peak. Very little was said between us during the first two hours minus some moans and groans of pleasure. 

The CEVs were full 8a, omnidimensional and transcendent, but still voluntary. No major ego death, no 8b, she claimed glimpses, but I'm not sure this chemical is capable of it. The visuals were augmented by the the light show of the concert on TV, color shifting, strobes, all added to the gorgeous imagery in our minds. Complete psychedelic landscapes and archetypal imagery, just magical!!! The OEVs are super standard tryptamine, not gonna expound. 

We came around towards the encore around 2240 and were able to discuss the experience. Immediately upon standing, wife had some stomach issues, the famous ""tryptamine shits"", like a purging of all that intensity. So much pleasure has to come at some cost, I guess. My stomach was a little queasy too, so we downed 8mg ondansetron to settle things down around 2200. That worked well. 

We sat and talked for a couple hours as the effects lingered, and watched a little of Louie CK's brand new Netflix special. We love Louie, he's on the level for sure. We enjoyed some apples and strawberries as a nice snack. 

Around T +5 we took some etizolam, and she fell asleep around the 5 1/2 hour mark. I'm pretty immune to etizolam and benzos genetically and stayed up for a while chatting in my head and browsing Reddit. I got really uncomfortable and hungry around T+7 and downed some bread and butter with another etizolam. Sleep finally came around 0330. Luckily my daughter promised before bed that she'd let us sleep in a little, so I got about 5 hours. 

This was so different than last weeks experience.  Same dose, same time line, but we used music as a catalyst for blast off this time. Last time we had no music, no distractions, and it was a wholly cerebral trip with lots of discussions and working out issues.

Growing up, I never talked to my parents about sex, drugs, or alcohol. I personally think I sought out most of what I got involved in. But, I was also lucky that I never got really caught up in anything too bad.

"60ug LSD report
On Friday I was surprised by my fiancé that we were going to the Capitol hill block party in Seattle for a day. Some of my favorite artists were playing, noname, Thundercat, mura masa, cherry glazerr and run the jewels were the ones we saw. I ended up taking the LSD about 15 minutes before leaving(we walked and used the subway) and got there about 2 hours after taking it and left about 8 hours after taking it so the event lasted about the entirety of the trip with the walk there and back encompassing most of the come up and come down. The concerts were absolutely phenomenal, and I peaked during Thundercats set which was by far the most profound to me. I took 2 hits off my vapcap at the start of his set which definitely potentiated my trip and brought on some nice visuals and headspace change during the set. All of the concerts were indescribable and completely life changing, and the acid only helped me to be in the right mind state to take it all in. Enough to feel it, not too much for it to override my mind. After getting back to my apartment at 1am at t+10:00 from dosing, I didn't feel sleepy at all and had a couple more hits from the vapcap and just laid out reflecting on the experience. All around a 10/10 experience. I fucking love LSD, especially in lower than traditional doses.",Addicted

"Drugs and depression
U/drugsaremagic's post on using ketamine made me think, along with other factors, about how drug use plays into depression. I think often people use drugs and realize that they are the easiest way to alter the mind, and so find an easy means to soften the pain of life, even when many don't realize that is what they are doing.

I think many people are ""depressed"" by the definition especially in the US and it's not until drugs give us an easy out do we often realize how heavy the burden of life is. Also there are other drugs that help us to open our mind, often leading us the realization that shit sucks haha. It's taken me a long time to have the awareness of the realities of life while simultaneously actually being able to compose myself on a daily basis. I think in actuality most people live their lives sort of dodging reality, creating their own ""drugs"" that help them not to think about whatever they feel that sucks. But us drug users are conveniently told our happiness is fake and chemically induced and somehow inferior. But in reality I think almost everyone, one way or another, is escaping reality to some extent, naturally or unaturally. Especially psychedelics have opened my eyes to looking at life for what it is, and really it ain't that pretty. But as true as the saying ignorance is bliss can be, I would personally never choose ignorance.

"How did you get here?
I'm glad this was started up. As funny as some of the posts on r/drugs were, I like the idea of a more focused discussion. 

That being said, what was the experience that most shaped your view of substance use? 

I'd honestly say my first experience was the catalyst for my current stance. That sounds rather obvious, but let me expand on that. 

I was in the military and struggling with what was then undiagnosed manic depression. Up to this point I'd never touched a drug, nor did I drink. I was adamantly against substance use. I didn't have a problem with others using, but I was sure that it wasn't my thing.

So, finding myself completely lost in a terrible place, both mentally and physically, I was desperate for anything. I had heard meditation was a good practice to get into and managed to end up on Erowid. Hours of research later and I'd fallen in love with the idea of entheogens. It was so radically different purpose wise than any thing I'd ever heard about drug use. 

A few weeks later I had gotten some HBWR, and was about to embark on my first experience. Some people love LSA, some hate it. I love what it did for me. That night was one of the most enlightening experiences I've ever had. I remember facing so many repressed feelings. I called my Dad the next morning to tell him I loved him. We never had been emotionally open, and after this we've been so much closer. 

After being completely blown away by this experience, I had to learn everything I could regarding substance use. This is how I came across Alexander Shulgin (hence the username...). Pihkal and Tihkal will forever be two of my favorite books.

"[x-post from r/MDMA] Advice wanted on leading a good first-time MDMA experience for a small group of older, professional friends
I am planning on guiding a group of 3-4 friends in their first experience of MDMA, and would like advice and suggestions on making this a positive trip for them.

I have been intensely interested in MDMA for months, have done a lot of research on safety, set and setting, and about a week ago, my partner and I went on a shared “journey” which was the first MDMA trip for both of us, although we have used other psychedelics in the past. This was really lovely and has rekindled positive vibes in an already good marriage.

My friends are all in their 40s and 50s, in professional health and mental-health service careers, though none of us are medical doctors. We are married, with kids and otherwise have pretty boring but meaningful lives. None of my friends would be likely to go to a rave, for instance.

Here’s what I’m thinking so far.

*    Go a bit low on dosage (100mg), and no redosing unless someone is having a good experience and asks for it. This should give people 2-3 hours of significant effect.

*    We’d do this in the daytime. One of us has a large private office, we can all clear out our schedules for the day responsibly and be available from noon onwards.

*    I would not dose with them. I think they’d be more comfortable and feel more safe knowing one person is sober, and I’m happy to stay out of the experience this time. Plus it’s been fairly recent for me and it’s likely better for me to wait a while. I’ll have other chances with my wife down the road :-)

*    I can have a gentle playlist of soft journey instrumental music going in the background.

*    Invite people to close their eyes as they start feeling the effects, and ask them to “go inside, feel the music, follow your breath, and go ahead and let go.”

*    A bit later, invite them to open the eyes, and if they are moved to do so, to take turns sharing what they are experiencing and feeling with the group.

*    If they want to “sample” some of the healing effects of the drug, they can be invited to think about something about themselves they would like to change, and to be with the feelings that come up as they think about it. Or to think about a person in their family they would like to connect with better, and to “go into” the different layers of that relationship.

*    Invite them to smile into each other’s faces.

*    Invite them to get up and dance to the music.

"1 tab DOB
So, over the weekend, I tried out a single tab of DOB 1.4 mg. I have been reading about it and was a little apprehensive about duration and effect. For those of you who don't know, I am married, and have kids, so a full day long trip could be a little challenging.

Not knowing how long it would last, and how I would take it, I cleared it with the wife first and dropped a tab at 9am. DOB is known to have a slow come up. I can confirm, it was 90 minutes before I started to feel definite effects. A bit cold, and a bit jittery. By 3 hours, I was starting to feel full effects. I got no visuals, and was pretty clear. I'd say it felt like maybe a half tab of LSD-25 (50-60ug). A noticable body buzz, but pretty functional.

So, I guess the main interesting thing about this drug, at this dose, is I stayed like this basically all day. The feeling did start to lessen by late night. Around 11pm, I was getting ready for bed. Still felt something, but was definitely less. I did manage to get my wife to get in the mood and was able to test this stuff out for sexual enhancement. I'll say it was promising. Since I was at the tail end, I don't think it was a true test, but I did have good control with no diminished sensation or erection. Still can't beat LSD, but definitely enhanced.

Was able to fall asleep probably ~1am. Woke up pretty clear. Slight headache, but that might have actually been from skipping coffee the day before. Overall, it was pretty good.

**Ingredients:**

7 mg 2C-B

1 Gel Cap

Water based lube

**Preparation:**

Weigh out the 4-FA and 2C-B and fill both directly into gel cap. Set aside until ready to use.

**How to serve:**

Be ready to do this all in one go, you won't have a lot of time before the gel cap starts to melt.

Tap your gel cap so all the powder is on the larger side of the cap.

Carefully open your cap back up.

Drop 3-6 drops of lube into the gel cap. Basically fill it to just below the rim of the larger half. Quickly close the gel cap back up.

Lube up the outside of the gel cap as well as at least one finger. And quickly insert the gel cap into rectum as far as you can with one finger.

Wash hands well.


So, what have you got? Any Gordon Ramsay or Julia Childs of drugs here?

Edit: Adjusted the recipe to 40/5. The 2c-b rectal come up overshadows the subtle low dose 4fa. I think taking 2c-b rectal at the same time as 4fa rectal is a little bit of a waste of the 4fa. Maybe 2cb first, then 4fa at peak?",Addicted

"Trip Report: Rapé (snuff)

After a few minutes I blew my nose and cleared it out.Then my heart rate increased. My whole body felt soft and relaxed. I meditated, sang, and had some very helpful insights. I didn't notice any visuals, but the experience itself was psychedelic. I was out of the meditation space after about 30 minutes, and close to baseline after an hour.

-- $65 for the complete test kit is a lot of money. I understand that it's a good value, since it's for 50 tests or whatever, but I'm not planning on doing this fifty times. Is there a smaller test kit out there with all four reagents, but smaller amounts of each? Something that would cost less?

-- I read the testing instructions, but can someone give me a summary/primer? The point of testing is to make sure that a) there's nothing bad in the pill AND b) there is actually MDMA in the pill. Is that right? 

-- For dosing, how to I make sure that I'm taking the right dosage? If I'm not going to trust what's in the pill (as indicated by the need to test what's in it), it seems I shouldn't trust what the stated dosage of the pill, either. Do I weigh the pill? I only have a standard digital kitchen scale.

-- I don't have the luxury of overnight childcare. Am I crazy to think that I can do this while they're at school? X was always an evening/night activity but even when I used to take more than one dose, I don't think the trip lasted longer than eight hours.

I'm thinking dose around 8:30, drop the kids off and be home at 9am. Get them some afterschool playdates, so I can have fun all day long but be OK to pick them up around 5:30. I remember that it always took around 45 minutes to start feeling it, then a bit more to really start peaking. Am I remembering more or less right? Does this seem like a ridiculous plan?

It's not a strict schedule, but I sometimes take say 0.5mg of Xanax on a Monday evening, to relax and enjoy my time after a hard day's work (I'm a writer). Then on Weds I might take 450mg of Pregabalin, again to relax. I don't drink much, maybe the odd glass of wine in an evening, so this is my downtime. 

Then on a Saturday I'd do about 100mg of codeine to relax again. 

Is all this dangerous and set to lead to mental and cognitive issues? Like I say, I'm a writer so worried about screwing up my brain. But I'm hoping these doses are so low and fairly infrequent that I'd be ok. I've been doing it a few months and not noticed any real differences in my work output or mental state. 

What do you guys think? I'm in my late 30s and is messing with drugs like this for kids and I should grow up and just sink a bottle of wine like most people my age? 

Forgot to say, I sometimes use these drugs as a way to wind down and sleep easier after a day on Modalert. ",Addicted
"Drug combination recommendations to take a break from reality for a few hours? (I have LSD, MDMA, 2C-B & potent weed)
Hey Reddit,

I have been working non stop 6 days a week for months without a break, and with a ton of stress. Entrepreneurship is brutal.

This week end I'm going to have 3 nights and 2 full days of break, zero responsabilities and the apartment for myself.

I want to trip my entire Friday night and then come down and relax the rest of the week end, then come back to work on Monday refreshed and ready to work and focus.

I have very good LSD tabs, some 2C-B, some high quality MDMA from a PTSD trial and a lot of good weed (bud, shatter, live resin, terp sauce... indica, hybrid and sativa)

The only drug I have never tried is the 2C-B.

I have already tried the following combinations:

LSD + shatter: 12h down the rabbit hole. Experienced synesthesia (sound+touch). Intense.
Truffles + weed: time distortion, amazing visuals, deep body relaxation. Not bad. But I'm not in Amsterdam and there are no truffles in NYC.
MDMA + Weed: A waste of both
I'm not looking for a philosopher's trip. I don't want to think. I'm looking to relax, take a vacation from the real world and jerk off.

The longer the trip the better.

What do you recommend, what dosages, and what to expect?

Thanks!

"Alcohol for MDMA come up anxiety?
Me again folks. Thanks for all the pleasant/helpful replies last time. 

Rolling tonight. Was just reminiscing on some earlier rolls and really am not too keen on the anxiety on the come up. I've never drank while rolling before, but considering it this time. I've heard mixed thoughts on the matter. Some people love to drink on the come up and some people think it's dumb because it dampens the roll. The feelings of alcohol subside fairly quickly for me though (big guy and a drink plenty) and am only thinking of having 2-3 drinks just to ease the come up.

"Looking to share my story and solicit advice when it comes to my self medicated Premature Ejaculation.
Hello fellow 30 year olds. I am an individual with an extremely extended history of opiate use. I am also a Premature Ejaculator. 

The Premature Ejaculation is severe. It's not the kind that can be beat by ssri drugs or lidocaine.  This is the boner to spurt back to soft within 20 seconds kind. The worst kind. 

Nothing worked. Alcohol wasn't strong enough. Heroin was too strong and I could never come.  Lidocaine added maybe 5 seconds. 

Then I found methadone. Taking about 30mgs in the morning about every two days made it so I had a completely normal sex life.  It didn't matter where or when.  If a spontaneous blowjob came about i wood bee good for ten minutes. I was cured. 

Also, it takes pain, cravings away so there's that up side too. 

The price of methadone can be stiff though. And it takes 2 hours to kick in so if my girlfriend wakes up horny and I haven't dosed yet (it being the dose day) I am usually screwed.  

I'd be very interested in hearing from all you other Premature ejaculators

"Notes on 2′-Oxo-PCM/Deschloroketamine/DCK
I’ve used DCK maybe 20 times the last couple of months and thought I would summarize my findings on this research chemical. 

First some personal info. I’m male, in my 30s. Kids. Wife. I have a lot of experience of psychedelics and all sorts of drugs, spanning over two decades. My wife doesn’t approve of my using drugs, so I keep it on the down low. All trips are taken in bed, while everyone is asleep. I usually listen to music, think, and write while tripping. 

1. I have not come across a drug that is as anti-anxiety and anti-depressive as DCK is. I’m quite high strung, introverted and prone to depression. For days after using, I feel very happy, outgoing, positive, life affirming. The wife has definitely noticed me being a lot happier since I came across this substance, but she doesn’t know why. The afterglow is powerful for almost the whole day after, but I would say I still feel better than normal for one or two days after that as well.

2. I’ve tried plugging and snorting. Plugging results in a clean, long trip. Around four hours I’d say. I feel very mentally clear. Lots of psychological insights. Works wonders for creative writing. Plugged, I find that DCK has a stimulant edge which makes it a bit difficult to fall asleep afterwards. I’ve often found myself lying awake through the night, only catching a few hours sleep. However, the afterglow the day after is so fantastic that I don’t even feel tired on three hours sleep. Just content and positive. Snorting is somehow trippier and more sedative. I don’t know if this is placebo, but it feels like that every time. On the advice of some friendly reddit user, I’ve filled a nasal spray with 10 ml of distilled water and about 300 mg DCK, which I then use as I please. Works very well.

3. As for doses, I´ve not gone very high. I’m a believer in less is more, and besides, I need to stay on planet earth in case the kids wake up or something like that. Highest I’ve gone is 40 mg plugged + maybe 20 mg from the nasal spray, spread out during a couple of hours. I like 40 mg to start with. I find it trippy but not overwhelmingly so.

4. One night I took maybe 20 mg DCK and around 10 mg 4-aco-dmt. That combination was absolute magic. I can´t wait to try it in higher doses. Also, I’ve found that using a high dose of DCK the night before tripping on say LSD is quite a good idea, since the afterglow is so nice. The day after DCK I wake up feeling happy and positive, and to then take some acid was very pleasant.

5. So far no negative experiences to report. I feel absolutely fine, after using if for a couple of times per week for about two months. I’d say the potential for addiction is quite high. Not that I’ve noticed any craving or physical dependancy, but it just feels so damn good. If one isn’t careful, I can certainly imagine one wanting to use it all the time.

6. In summary, DCK is definitely top three best drugs I’ve come across during my life as a psychonaut. It’s fun, incredibly versatile, cheap, lasts longer than regular K or 2-FDK. I find it much less visual than K or 2-FDK. Maybe higher doses are needed. But as I said, to combine it with a tryptamine like 4-aco-dmt worked very well, and that definitely produced visuals. 

What I like most about it is that it does wonders as a tool for exploration of the psyche, and as a tool for writing. It makes me very creative and insightful. I’ve produced a major amount of good quality material since I started using it. I’ve also understood a lot of things about my self that I’ve struggled to grasp before. For other dad trippers out there, give it a try.

7. I should maybe the batch comes from a Swedish vendor. I don’t know where it originally is from. I’ve understood that different batches produce different results. This one is slightly tan, looks a bit like sugar. Not caustic, actually slightly sour. 

If you have any questions, I’ll try to reply.",Addicted
"Stimulant Use
How many of you guys use stimulants on at least a somewhat regular basis? I'm talking stronger than caffeine. I ask because I've dabbled a bit with a few of the standard ADHD meds, and I don't really *like* them that much as far as many of their effects go, but if I can find a way to get into a task I can do it reasonably well, though I still experience distraction. Put simply, I don't know where I would be right now without them. But I'm wary of their harm potential, I can really feel just how shitty something like vyvanse affects my body. The thing is, I'd  love to live in a way where I only use drugs occasionally and for recreation.

"Mental health and substance use...
From my reading of r/drugs and r/drugsover30, it seems a lot of us have some history with mental health issues. Be it depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety or any of the spectrums outside of these... Do we use to self medicate? I know I do for sure. 

On that note, is self medicating and inherently devious practice? If you even mention it to a medical professional, or anyone honestly, the reaction you receive seems to be pretty negative as a whole. I'm not sure if I'm helping or hurting myself most days, while others I'm convinced that without my varied substance use I'm not sure I'd still be here. 

I've been feeling rather low as of late, and pretty suicidal to be honest. I seem to get this bouts of suicidal thoughts for no apparent reason. There isn't a cause. Nothing happens to which I reply ""killing myself will fix this!"". I think a lot of it stems from the lack of apparent meaning in life. Don't get me wrong, I think I lead a pretty solid life. I've been making a much more comfortable living after getting out of the military, have friends to be around when I want to (super introverted, being alone calms me) and a job that I feel pretty proud of. I even fill my downtime with school and playing music. Yet, I still feel incredibly empty. Drugs fill this void. They bring the magic of childhood back. I know this can't be healthy, but maybe some of us are just wired the wrong way. Maybe some of us run on 240 while the world only puts out 120, as an electrical analogy.

"Advice about RC empathogens
I've recently got into MDMA again after a 12 year break and have been doing it a little too often so am looking for something else to help me spread the E experiences out a bit.

I think like some of you here my middle-aged drug experiences are quite different to those when I was younger, so I wonder if you can give me your opinion on what would be good to try.

My experiences are now had at home with my wife and we are looking for the removing of inhibitions, sex enhancement, opening up to each other, talking, bonding, enjoying music, some therapy and so on. Our normal routine is MDMA followed by 2-CB and a little bit of ket later on and it's normally bloody great but it is losing it's magic a little bit. I've gone off doing 2C-B alone at the moment as I had a bit of a rough one recently which has left me a little bit wary of pure psychs due to anxiety which I am sure will resolve in time but I don't feel like doing any on their own right now. But after MDMA 2C-B is amazing for me.

So I'm looking for something empathic and could perhaps combine well with 2C-B and Ket, i.e. put me into a non-anxious state and to enhance connectivity with my wife, mentally and sexually.

I've read the reports about 6-APB on here (and on r/drugs but the headless chicken nature of that forum makes gleaning any decent info from there almost futile) and a little about 4-FA.

Is there anything more you can tell me about those substances or anything else to consider? 

I've never tried any RC's and only got back into drugs after the ban. If it's any help I have tried LSD, 2C-B, speed, coke, mushies, MDA, MDMA, MDMB, Ket, weed. Psychs are okay but my favourite has always been MDMA. Don't particularly like stims (other than E which is unique really), never enjoyed coke or speed and I gather 6-APB can be a bit tweaky?

"A nice relaxing 4-AcO-MET 1st time trip with the wife.
Sorry long post, but I think this is better off here. 

I recently acquired 250mg of this chemical from a reliable source. I've been waiting for a nice time to do it, and the extra hour from daylight savings time sounded great. We're both in our mid 30s with a one school age kid, I'm a critical care specialist and my wife runs a small business and I have four days off of work. Woo!!

After a light dinner of grilled shrimp and homemade Caesar salad (the king of salads) with the kid soundly asleep, we insufflated 15mg for her and 20mg for me. She's sensitive to psychs so she preloaded with 2 mg etizolam. I took my normal nighttime meds Propranolol 40mg and oxycodone 7.5mg for a chronic condition. 

Weighed on the Gem20, so doses are approx. insufflation was painless and drip was slow and nasty, just like a tryptamine. First alerts around 30mins with stoned body load, warm and comforting. At about an hour, game on. The come up was so easy and relaxing, and quickly turned erotic. We retired to the bedroom for some sexytime and the peak started as we were conjoined into some blissful cosmic miasma of flesh and brilliant closed eye visuals. Dancing imagery of mandala patterns and humanoid shapes, very sexual in nature. Neither could orgasm and I started getting some upset stomach and annoying leg twitches/fasciculations that were a little concerning. 

We decided to head back to the couch and I took 8mg of Zofran to offset the tummy troubles after a big trippy bowel movement at around T+3, my visuals were stilll very strong, open and closed. Classic tryptamine with a new 3D effect and lots of swirling smoke phenomenon on pattenered surfaces. Neat!!  Still, barely any headfuck at this dose!  We had some expansion of thought, making oddball connections to ideas and objects, but no thought looping and really no ego loss, time flowed normally or slightly quickly actually. 

At T+4 my wife was essentially at baseline but still had a lot of mental energy and clarity. My daughter heard us giggling madly and came downstairs to investigate. We watched some BBC Planet Earth and awed at the patterns in nature for a while. I was still having residual visuals. The kid saw the same things, I swear, kids are naturally on drugs 24/7!!  We sent her up to bed and exactly at hour 5, we dosed more etizolam and we're asleep within an hour. Dosed at 7:45pm and asleep by 12:45am. Great duration!!!!!  It's hard to fit psychs into my schedule, and this was perfect. 

This was an extremely pleasant and fun psychedelic. In these low doses you still get visuals and some expansion of thought, but very little anxiety or confusion compared to 4-AcO-DMT. Just a really great chem for relaxing, sexy times, and having a good 4 hour giggle session. Awesome compound!  Will explore deeper and maybe IV (my favorite ROA for solo trips).  ",Addicted
"Ketamine Therapy - Day 1
Well... didn't really do shit.

Haha, honestly maybe too soon to tell, but there was no immediate relief like you hear about with IV infusion.

We did approx 5-7 mg insufflated every 10 minutes 5x. For a total of 25-35 mg over 50 minutes. (Wife is ~120 lbs). This is based on the reddit post in my first ketamine post. It's lower than what I see in other recommendations, but we wanted to start conservatively.

She did say she felt a little dizzy and out of it. Not in a bad/queasy way, but just in a slightly intoxicated way. We did this at night, just before bed. She never really got any sense of relief, although she did say she slept a little better, which is a win. Mornings are very hard for her though, and that was not improved.

I did read a post here on reddit saying that they did't really feel relief from insufflated therapy until the third day. So we're willing to keep at it for a bit. Perhaps slightly larger dose. Not sure if we're going to do consecutive days or every other. At this point I'm leaning toward consecutive.

A little more info. My wife is dealing with negative though patterns. We both recognize that the best thing for her, long term, would be to work on combatting the negative thoughts, rather than just looking for a substance that will change her mood. That being said, the thoughts are so strong right now that it is hard for her to function and to fight the thoughts. We are hoping the ketamine can give her enough of a window of relief that she can focus some more energy on fighting her negative thought patterns. Right now the strategies that she is trying is meditation, consciously correcting false negative thoughts, and therapy starting Friday.

"What drugs did you take this weekend?
So the wife was out of town and I had some time to experiment on my own. On Friday, I plugged 5 mg 5-MeO-MIPT. We've been a little hit or miss with this substance. Now, we mainly used it to enhance sex in the past. It works, but hasn't been as great as acid. The main downside is that it gives my wife some anxiety and nausea. Not just a normal nausea though, kind of like a bad weed trip nausea. So I wanted to try plugging it to see if the negative effects were lessened (I felt a little bit of the nausea before, just not as bad as my wife). I think plugging was better for the nausea/anxiety, but as usual, the come up was rougher. By evening, that experiment was over. I still had some energy left, so I took a 15 mg 2c-b to chill the rest of the evening. Slept around 2. Felt fine the next day.

Day 2 - Saturday. Usually my wife and I do MDMA together with long breaks in between. This weekend, I sent my wife out with friends and MDMA care packages. So that meant I had a free MDMA cycle. What I've been putting off trying due to the wait times is 6-APB. So, I capped 125 mg and gave that a whirl. Maybe it was because I was taking it alone, but it'd was very... okay. It *was* kind of like MDMA, but with much less of the physical warmth, waves, and tingles. I think as far as ""not-MDMA"" substances go, I am liking 4-FA better.

Day 3 - Sunday. My past tests with 4-ACO-MET had been underwhelming. So today I dosed 50 mg. Granted, I may have had some cross tolerance with the 2c-b and 5-MeO-MIPT, but overall it was a great dose. I probably won't dose lower that 50 mg again. It was still very clear with a subtle mood lift.

So, just a note. This weekend was an exception, I rarely do more than one substance over the weekend. Also, all my doses and substances were at levels where I was still very functional.",Addicted
"Music?
I'm not sure if this is common, but I've never used a substance without having a prepared playlist rolling. It helps me set the mood and focus of the experience. I've also found it serves as a time keeper, which is a huge help for those times when it feels like you've slipped dimensions and are stuck in an absence of time.

Outside of that, so many drugs I've used make music a religious experience. Beyond the Valley of the Three White Horses by Andrew Bird on DXM is sublime. I can't put it into words.

Hi all. Gonna roll with my wife tomorrow. We are in our early 30's. Done everything textbook, tested, got our supplements, etc. I haven't rolled in about 2 years and my wife is a first timer. We are both pretty sensitive/anxious people so we are kind of nervous of the comedown possibility.

"Plugging Adderall?
I am planning to take 2.5mg of adderall orally and then plug 7.5mg. I have never plugged before and am intrigued to try it. 

I saw someone on r/drugs talking about a cold water extraction of Adderall for the purpose of snorting by mixing the Adderall with water so that the amphetamines dissolve and separate from much of the filler which floats on top. My plan is to take the 7.5mg, crush it up, stir it in 7-8ml of water, suck it up into a disposable syringe that I've used for making cannabis edibles before, and then using lube, insert it into the anus and plunge. I'm assuming I'll need to clench my asshole for a bit afterwards to hold it all in, not sure if there's a process for this. I've done a bit of anal play before so I get the general idea of putting something in my ass. I plan to take the 2.5mg orally right before attempting all of this.

Any suggestions/advice? Is there something I'm missing here or a better way? I'm very excited to try plugging and a faster ROA than oral. I've tried crushing 5mg and taking it sublingually and that was pretty nice.",Addicted

t+2:00: went for a kickass bike ride where most of the time I was just searching for a pump lol. Took a cool picture along the way, but not sure how to post it. Listening to pink Floyds dark side of the moon now and it's absolutely fantastic. Anyone else a hi-fi addict? Lol

"MDMA hangovers for the over 40's
I first took MDMA in '91 or '92, good pills in them days: doves, calis, snowballs. Took speed as well sometimes but never particularly liked it, had a great time when the free party scene was still going in the UK until the govt. put an end to it all in '94. 

Until the autumn just gone I hadn't taken MDMA in about 12 years. Back in the day whether I was doing a half at a funfair, dropping 3 at an all-nighter, or doing a Thursday thru to Sunday weekender I would always feel totally wrecked and depressed and only by the following Thursday lunchtime would the grimness start to lift, I would feel positive again and be ready for the next one!

So received wisdom would have it that hangovers get worse as you get older and yet having get hold of some E again, now  in my mid forties the hangovers are near non-existent. In fact I get a positive after glow, just feel a bit tired the day after and regularly go for a 75 mile bike ride the day after that. No suicide Tuesday or much in particular.

"3-MeO-PCP 5mg plugged
Took 5 mg 3-MeO-PCP in a gel cap. Absolutely no discomfort. One of the easiest substances to plug so far. Come up was very slow for a rectal administration. Took about 45 minutes to really feel anything, but at +45 it definitely kicked in.

Overall it was mellow. Easier going than K, but it was also a pretty small dose. I guess I still don't really get the love for disassociates. It was ok. A bit of body buzz, some numbing. Kind of like alcohol with less fun. I guess that's what I said about k too, but at least at lower doses, I think I like this better than k. I hung out and watched some tv... felt pretty relaxed. I don't think low dose k was as good for just chilling for me. K was more a lie in bed drug for me, even at low doses.

I guess so far with k and now with 3-MeO-PCP, they both seem pretty easy to handle at low and moderate doses. I have no real compulsion to redose, and I'm not feeling like sleep will be a problem (I'm at +4 hours now and feeling close to baseline). Higher doses may be a different story. So, for changing it up, maybe sometimes on weekday thing, it might find a place.

"140 mg ketamine insufflated
Another round of testing with ketamine last night. 50 mg in each nostril followed by 20 mg in each after 10 minutes.

Definitely a different experience than my last trial at 60 mg. Didn't hit k-hole, but when I closed my eyes, I felt like I was in a different place. I was affected enough that occasionally I would open my eyes just to check if my body was still responsive. Lying down with my eyes closed, cuddled up next to my wife was actually really nice. But if I opened my eyes and moved my head at all, it was dizzying. Standing up later even after the peak, made me feel dizzy and nauseous.

So, it was a good dose. It was definitely interesting. I can't imagine doing anything on this dose. All I wanted to do was curl up and lie there. On a side note, between my doses, I was trying to type out some comments on reddit. It was very hard to focus and type.",Addicted
"Had a gram of Hexen, first time today. Some thoughts about this iffy chemical.
This is gonna be long, cause I'm stimming my nuts off. Feeling shitty earlier today, in the middle of a few days off, have some paperwork to do, but it's boring, wife is a little lethargic from too much oxy use in the last few days, which she's since ran out of,  and suggests we try the Hexen that's been sitting in my cabinet for two weeks to see how it does as a pick me up. I've read all the horror stories of this chemical, the fiendish compulsion, the cardiovascular side effects, and the psychosis with too much. So I've had my doubts, but it was so cheap I added it to my last SI order with the DCK. 

I don't love dopaminergic stimulants that much, but I do enjoy some blow on the rare occasion, but blow is really bad for my heart, so Hexen sounded like a reasonable substitute. We started around 1pm after a pretty crappy lunch fast food lunch with a modest 20mg bump. 

Warning: I took my propranolol around 6 am, so there's still about half my dose in my system. Not a great plan to mix non-selective BBlocker with NDRIs, bad vasoconstriction and angina can occur. I'm aware of this and have some nitroglycerin if I really need to drop the vasoconstriction down fast. Wife took a half dose of metoprolol this morning, it's cardioselective, so should be fine. We also have plenty of etizolam to counter side effects need be. 

T:00:01- damn that shit burns!  Wow. Didn't expect that. Wife took it first to be guinea pig. I waited about 10 minutes. 

T:00:05 - already feeling clear headed and motivated. Pacing around the room, wife feels nice and calm, her opiate withdrawal symptoms are quickly waning. Dopamine is a great thing. Sinuses are numb now, hard palate is numb also. Drip is tasteless and fine. 

T:00:20 - talking about lots of shit, flowing easily, but already feeling like it wasn't enough. We take another 10mg bump, to get to 30mg which is a good place per other reports. This is nice, feels a lot like good coke, but not as smooth, more jittery. 
I sit down and hammer out some work stuff, blabbering the whole time.

T:00:45 - okay, wow, already craving more. Short lived euphoria, physical and a little mental. Heart rate is already up to 80 from 60. 

T:00:55: we redose another small bump because the chatting is slowing down, and the clarity is waning. Boom: right back at it. Pacing and talking persist, she is way calmer than I am, but stims do that to her, maybe a little ADD? It would make sense. 

T 02:00 time for another dose! 20 mg on a scoop.  This shit is unrelenting. But I'm now getting really horny, which stims do to me without fail. We have about an hour before we have to pick the kid up at the bus stop down the block. We head upstairs for a little play time, we both orgasm really hard and pretty easily, considering a mild case of stim dick, but my desire took over.  I take a hot shower and feel pretty decent. 

T 02:50 time to get the kid, so another 20mg bump. Super clear mentally now, HR is high 120s for me, 130s for her. Feeling the peripheral effects, cold feet and hands, mild sweating, rapid respiratory rate, lots of jaw clenching for me. We drive to grab some food for the kiddo to keep her occupied. Driving feels nice and easy, like I'm hyper acutely aware of everything. Super safe, I stick to the speed limits. She's really a good girl, she needs very little and is super sociable always. She's super tired so an early dinner and early bedtime are in the cards. 

T 04:00 yikes. Feeling pretty shitty. Decide to skip this one and take 2.5mg etizolam to offset the nasty effects. Wife is weirdly nauseous and throws up a little, she takes an ondansetron to help. I go upstairs for a little 'me time' and wank again, Jesus stims jack my libido up! 

T 05:00 comedown is mitigated by etizolam and rest, I use a heating pad on my feet to warm up. 
I put the kid to bed early, like 6:30 pm, it's fine, she's tired and ready. Come downstairs and eat a PB&J sandwich which my wife had also and made one for me. Eating was not terribly hard. I take my nightly 10mg oxycodone with food. That should help!  

T 06:00  We take a metoprolol each, for the heart rate, and stupidly decide to bump another 30mg. Well, right back at it. I get on here and I'm writing right now on the last bump. Can you tell?!?  It's easy to focus on a task, remarkably after so many redoses. My heart rate is getting real high, but I feel pretty damn good. Not getting the vasoconstriction now, maybe that's the etizolam from earlier. 

Now: 7:45 pm. We decide this is the last bump, 15mg or so, not feeling antsy or jittery just wanna write!!  She's getting into her business doings and redditing also. Feeling pretty great!  Gonna cap it off with some 9lb Hammer pure indica we got at the dispensary last week, maybe some more etizolam before bed. 

Tl;dr : stim ranting from a non-stim guy. This is some nasty shit!  Super compulsive, but maybe we are taking lower doses, and it's not lasting as long. It seems pretty pure, I trust the source. Fine white crystals, very light and fluffy, and a little sticky, but sniffs just fine. Yucky cardiovascular side effects for sure. No palpitations like coke though, so less direct beta stimulation, seems less likely to cause arrhythmia. This has no use in my arsenal, but I wanted to try it because of all the hype. Maybe for a younger heart. Sexual activity was gratifying. It's pretty clear headed when you bump it, but the comedown is nasty and dirty. Gonna flush the rest probably, sadly it's not a good thing for us to have around. 



Day after update: we slept okay, but we're incredibly lethargic today. Probably on account of too much everything.  No worries, we didn't flush the Hexen so we are gonna keep it going and that seems to be working out just fine. Very focused on Reddit this morning, lol!

"More thoughts on 4-FA
The other day, I had an open bar event to go to. I often find myself drinking more than I should at these things. Maybe it's because I'm such a cheap bastard and I can't pass up a free drink. I've found that taking a drug that I believe should not be mixed with too much alcohol give me the mental discipline to limit my alcohol consumption. I've done this with low dose LSD, and this time, with 60 mg 4-FA.

It worked out great. I've been trying different things with 4-FA lately. Not definitive yet, but I think oral may be better than rectal for this substance. 60 mg gave me a good little body buzz. I limited my alcohol to 3 glasses of whiskey over 4 hours or so. They complimented each other quite well.

The 4-FA was taken around 3:30 pm. I slept easily and restfully around midnight.

I guess I'm still testing the waters a bit with how often I can use 4-FA at low doses. I know the problem is, at these doses, I probably won't feel the effects of damage while they are happening. So, if anyone has any information, or even theories, about dangers of low dose (<100mg) 4-FA, let me know.

"Alcohol vs recreational drugs - evening unwind
I've gone through periods of time when I would have a couple large shots of liquor in the evening most nights. As I got more interested in recreational drugs, I actually started drinking less. I think due to responsible practices with recreationals, my combined use of alcohol+other drugs is actually lower than when it was just alcohol.

So, in my messy logic, recreational drug use has actually made me safer and healthier. Anyone else actually form better habits due to drugs?

"150ug LSD trip was amazing!
Finally was able to really try acid for the first time! Previously I had just microdosed about 30-40ug. If you had seen previously I had been figuring out how to break up candies that had been dosed. The dealer got back to me and said we could just break them to whatever portion we wanted, and that worked great! My cousin and I took 150ug each while my two other friends who had never tripped did 100ug. Two of our other friends ended up coming at 8pm and taking an eighth of shrooms, we had dosed at 2:30pm

Overall it was amazing and everyone had a great time. It was more visuals than I was expecting and definitely very unique from shrooms which I have more experience with.

The only question I guess I have is one of my friends who tried it for the first time said she would prefer more visuals without any more of a headspace, since she didn't think she could handle more headspace change, she just wanted more visuals.

"ED Meds
I never needed ED meds until I tried MDMA. MDMA not only gave me problems maintaining the night of, but the problems lasted for almost a week. So, I sought out ED meds.

Since I was around 40 at the time, I actually talked to my doctor and got a prescription. Cialis had a free trial coupon, so my doctor wrote me a prescription for that. He also gave me a free sample pack of Viagra. First the bad news. When everything is working right, ED meds don't do all that much for you. I had heard stories of super erections and tiny refractory periods. It didn't seem to make much difference to me when I was ok. But when I had MDMA dick, it did fix that.

Ok, so on to the next problem. Real ED meds are expensive. I mean, crazy expensive. So, I ventured out on the Google machine and I found the least sketchy, but still cheap, meds from India site. So far I have ordered twice from this site. The first time was a sampler pack. You pay shipping $29, and you get 10 each of the three major ED med generics.

"Why can;t my loved ones get Addiction. It changes our brains, we lose the power of choice
I am a recovering addict and Bi-Polar 1 and I have Lyme Disease. I think what you are leaving out is the fact that most addicts ARE predisposed, and that's genetics, that's science, its a truth. So that means there is some kind of chemical or human make-up that makes it more likely to be an addict right?

Now, that does not guarantee someone is an addict, not at all, but it helps get someone there. Most addicts have some environmental circumstance at an early age that leads to a ""I'm not enough"" component. They also often (Not always) start at an early age or sometime before there brain is developed. Substance use is almost like self medicating, it is a symptom but not the problem. And as the brain is still developing, there are pathways created by the consistent reward drugs provide to the brain (All different kinds of chemicals are released depending on the drug).

That impact on the brain makes addiction less of a choice. The longer you impact the brain with drug use the more the brain changes. (I Hope this makes sense... lol). This causes the desire for substances- physically AND MENTALLY. Addicts like myself, move substance use up the hierarchy of our survival skills. It becomes more important than food, more important than shelter, more important than begin around others and socializing. When it becomes more important than typical survival skills, it also becomes less and less of a choice for the addict. Now not EVERYONE who uses substances becomes an addict; we must remember that we all have different makeups and no two brains are the same. So imo I just don't feel comfortable writing something like this off and making it black and white. Its gray like everything else besides Calculus (not funny).

Initially, I believe we all had a choice, but over time we lose the ability to make that choice clearly, we have changed our brains and our body's and now suffer from a ""disease"". It is no longer ""up to you"". The you that once was known is now gone- and not coming back for that matter. And now what is left is a changed person who no longer has as clear of a choice as non-addicts. And this isn't a bad thing, we are all entitled to our journey.",Recovering

Hey guys 

Had few questions about 6-apb, finally after about a 10week break from anything like this got to try some 6apb I’ve been sitting on with my buddy never taken it before. We took 150mg of the succinate and first thing is wow if MDMA was a 10/10 this was like a 8.5 or 9 out of 10 . Insane smooth rolling for like 6.5 hours I can’t believe off one dose you roll for so so long it’s crazy . 

K question time the only thing we noticed is it just wasn’t “quite” their,  like we were rolling feeling the love in a non forced 6apb way rather than pushy but, there wasn’t that crazy “peak POW” moment it was smooth , almost as if you took mdma at say 125mg rather than 150mg we felt like we were just one tiny notch below 

For people who have done this , would if we took a bit more say 175mg or 185mg? Would we get that “face rolling” or is this what 6apb is? 

I decided to stick to the lower end at 150mg but does going up make it roll harder or is what we felt what we get 

10/10 would do again , longer smoother non forced love and empathy chatty eurphoric insane how good and close to pure mdma it was , sedating but stimulating . I am noticing a bit more of a hangover today than mdma tho tired headache nothing crazy

This past weekend was a scorcher in my neck of the woods. Temps in the 100s.. Weather normally doesn't even get into the high 80s, so most people don't have AC.

As I was lying on my bed, trying not to move, the thought of doing drugs sounded really unappealing. I was hot, sweaty, and uncomfortable. Being hot, sweaty, uncomfortable, and high didn't sound fun. I guess opioids or benzos could help you not care, but they're not on my menu.

So what do you guys do when it's too hot to be happy?",NA
"Finally tried DMT
After sitting on my stash for a year, I finally got around to trying it.

It went... so so

The main problem is method. I used what many people say is one of the more difficult methods of vaping DMT: The oil burner (meth pipe). What I have discovered with my attempts at DMT and also with my previous attempts at a-PHP. It takes a certain level of experience with an oil burner to vape a lot of substance at one, and to not burn it.

So I ended up getting pretty small hits of DMT, and not really getting even close to breakthrough. What I did get was enough of a hit where when I laid down and closed my eyes, I could see a dark space full of geometric outlines of shapes. Sound got weird, and my body felt buzzy. But as soon as I opened my eyes, everything seemed pretty normal.

It was a nice mini-trip/high, but I either need to level up on my pipe skills, or move on to a new method. I've read about all of them: the machine, GVG, sandwich method, changa, etc.

Will be trying again relatively soon-ish.",Addicted
"Mephedrone oral just not working for me
Tried 275mg 4MMC last night. It seriously did almost nothing. I know the most typical ROA is nasal, but there are so many horror stories about using it that way. I knew oral would be weaker, but 275mg and nothing?

The most annoying thing is this shit cuts into my SRA window for all substances. So now I have to wait 4 to 12 weeks to try again or to do MDMA or 6-APB. I have to admit, I am tempted to try railing it next time. I want to experience *something*.",Addicted

"Which drugs make your depression worse?
My wife loves MDMA, but when she's in depression, it doesn't work as well, and it can make her feel worse afterwards. Acid also, is just not as fun for her when she is depressed.

So, what drugs do you normally like, but avoid when you are clinically depressed? And what drugs are safer to do without driving depression deeper?

I was looking at mephedrone, but found out it also works on serotonin, and can have harsh comedowns. 4-FA at low doses is supposed to be light on the serotonin release. Are dopaminergic drugs any better?

Thoughts, experiences?  Thanks.",Addicted
"Ordered some mephedrone... for science!
Ok, so 90% of the posts I saw about mephedrone (4-MMC) were horrible. Now normally, I would steer very clear of any substance where everyone who was using it was saying it was terrible. But here's why I ordered it anyway:

Most of the people reporting terrible experiences were young people in the UK who were railing grams of this a night on a regular basis. Now, I hope I'm not being too confident in my self control, but I am thinking that doing moderate (150-250mg) doses ingested and committing not to redose will keep me out of trouble.

There were a handful of people who reported being able to maintain control while taking 4-MMC. So, we'll see. If in a month or so, I report that my life is being ruined by 4-MMC, you should all stay the hell away! I am generally super stable and super controlled. I have a good job, a great family, and everything to lose. If I can't control myself with this stuff, then this stuff is truly the devil.

I will state right here, right now, if this stuff is really too good for me to control, I will dump my stash. Wish me luck DO30'ers.

"Have any of you guys tried Sassafras? whats your story?
Me and my SO started experiencing with drugs in our early 30's and after lots of reading we decided to try Molly.
Since we have Zero experience we ended up getting Extacy which was an amazing experience, trying to get that feeling again a year later while looking for Molly we got Sassafras and even though we read all the negative/possible side effects we gave it a shot but the effects were very different for both of us.


Wife: Very horny but with a massive headache and a body high that made her as if her limbs were flying.

Me: While with her I felt nothing at all as if I had a placebo. 
Note: this is PM hours.
when I get up to go to work the next day I felt the high, similar to my wife except the headache I went to work scared yet very happy since it was an amazing feeling, working with customers I was the best and my co-workers were like Wow you are on a roll.
To make the story shorter my wife did not have a good experience while I did in a weird way since my high started hours later and lasted all day at work.

"Looking for people to take part in online research study
Hello, I hope it is okay to post this here, my apologies if not. 

I’m Roxy and I am a third year undergraduate in psychology. As part of my final year project I am looking for people in the UK who use drugs recreationally, to take part in a study which involves a survey and some interesting tests. **You can also enter a prize draw to win £25 of Amazon vouchers!**

I am looking for participants who are over the age of 18, living in the UK and who have NO history or diagnosis of epilepsy, ADHD or severe mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), and who fit one of the following five categories:

* Use spice (synthetic cannabis) recreationally or casually (have used spice within the last 6 months).
* Have used spice (synthetic cannabis) in the past, but no longer do (have not used spice for 6 months or more).
* Use drugs recreationally but have never used spice (synthetic cannabis).

I have ethical approval. It would be fantastic if you are able to take part, the study should take about 20 minutes to complete and the link to begin is below. The study will work best on a laptop or desktop computer, rather than a mobile phone as the tests will not work on mobiles. **Please do not use a mobile phone.**

"LSD, Adderall and weed dosing plan
Hello all! I am planning a nice little mental experimental schedule for my upcoming day off. Here is my plan...

6:30: wake up at a normal time for me. Have a large breakfast to keep me as full as possible.

7:30: drop 50-75ug LSD. Go for a walk, listen to music, just pass the time through the come up.

~11:30: 5mg Instant Release(IR) adderall

~12:00: insufflate 5mg adderall. After this I'll start bringing cannabis into the picture as needed/wanted.

~5:30: Fiance will be home. Don't need to be sober, but I want to be sober enough to spend a good afternoon with her. We haven't had too much time together so my plan is just to be sober enough to be able to normally interact. It'll have been about 10 hours after dosing the acid and a few hours after dosing the adderall, so I think for the most part I'm just expecting to be stoned and mentally exhausted.

I will be using pretty much this same dosing regimen, but with alcohol included for a concert in a little over a month, which is partially why I want to test it out, but I also havent tripped alone or tripped at all in a while. Im also looking forward to combining psychedelics and stimulants as I haven't done that before and think I will really enjoy the effects.

My only real thing I'm uncertain about is insufflating the adderall. I've never snorted anything and I feel like the adderall pill is mostly just filler and I don't know how healthy that is to snort...I just realized coming on to this sub that I could actually plug it haha. Has anyone plugged adderall or amphetamine in general? Idk I might just stick with oral for that, we'll see how I feel.

I just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts, and also just wanted a place to write my thoughts out. This is my plan for the upcoming Tuesday. Thought you guys would enjoy hearin my plan and I could possibly get some positive feedback!

"5mg adderall and cannabis report
Last night was going over to a friends for board game night. I was already exhausted, and had had 8 5mg adderall IR's sitting in my drug box for a few months. I decided to take one about 6pm, it was a gentle comeup until about 7:30, held strong until about 10 or 11, but unfortunately had lingering effects till past 2am as I didn't sleep till almost 3. It was very similar in potency to downing 50mg of caffeine, noticeable but not overwhelming at all. More euphoria than caffeine, less body load, but also a much harsher comedown and a bit of a hangover this morning. Overall was a good experience and I had just the energy I wanted to enjoy the party and power through more cannabis than I'd normally be able to handle while still staying awake haha.

This was my first time using stims in a while besides caffeine. My only other experience was 5 10mg IR adderall that I had my hands on about 2 and a half years ago that I took on separate occasions, also combined with cannabis. Overall a really positive experience, though I will keep moderation with use to keep the magic and since it still is decently hard on the body and mind as far as drugs come.",Addicted

"10 mg 3-MeO-PCP Plugged
Second go at 3-MeO-PCP. The first time was in a gel cap. This time was a 1 ml syringe.

The first time, I reported the come up to be very slow ~45 min and very mild. This time, the come up began within 10 minutes and got pretty well up to speed within 20 min or so. Effects were significantly stronger. There was a warm tingly feeling. Not a lot of headspace, mainly body. But very different from 5 mg. I'm finding 3-MeO-PCP to be a much more recreational chem than ketamine. Ketamine makes me feel numb and if I try to walk, I feel slightly dizzy with a tinge of queasiness. 3-MeO-PCP has less numbing, more buzz, and less dizziness. I didn't feel any queasiness.

At 10 mg, it was a relaxing, easy high. No visual distortion or psychedelic effects. I could see using this as an alcohol replacement every once in a while. I think the recommended wait times are around 1 week minimum for long term tolerance though.

"LSD-trip report (120 or 150) where I met my ancestors, got killed and was mourned for by them.
Hello, reddit!

First of all I would like to apologize beforehand for any mistakes I most likely have made in this first post of mine here: English is not my native language, but I try to do my best.

So, I wanted to share my most amazing trip with you and I hope you enjoy it. 

One year ago me and my boyfriend took 2 LSD stamps which contained 150ug I think. It was the first time he ever tried it, while I’ve had some experience with it already, including max of 800ug I think. So we took it in our apartment while lounging on the sofa and at some moment we started cuddling and kissing while waiting LSD effects to open up. Eventually, the cuddling transformed into tender love making. I’d rather not call it sex, because it felt like there was nothing dirty, unnatural, nothing that has a fleur of secrecy and biology. It was a feeling of a Biblical scale: it felt like I knew him, and he knew me. It was very proper in the sense like the “Songs of the songs” is a part of the Old Testament. And that’s when my most amazing trip has begun…

I felt that I am not just myself, but I contain so many other women, who are actually me too, who were born in other ages, in different countries, in different classes, but each of them was me myself as we’ve all had soul. Same was for him—we had sex, and I felt like every time I have ever been born to this place I was meeting him and I loved him. All this was happening through time—we were making love in all of our many faces born throughout history, we made love through the epochs, it was the first young love, and it was a farewell love before he went to war, and he was my landlord, and he was a Jew and I were a German. Just our looks were changing, but we were still ourselves, in love and twirling around each other like quarks. 

So I entered the brightest part of the trip during this unbelievable and harmonic interaction between me and him and when I had an orgasm… 

The next thing that happened to me was I suppose what people call the ego death. I was in a blank black space, absolutely empty. I wasn’t even sure if I am separated from everything else or am I a part of it. I couldn’t differ myself from my surrounding. But it wasn’t scary at all. I felt like I am a flying thought, but I wanted to see if there is anything but me and thought that would be difficult, because I needed to see it first. And I need eyes to see. But how can I have eyes if I am a thought? I need to see someone’s else eyes to understand that someone can watch me just like I can do. So it was a paradoxal trip that made me move around and look for something distinctively separated from me. 

So I went down and there was an endless field of snow, and I was flying above it like a gentle cold breeze. I was playing with the tops of the birches, making them dance with me a little.

Then I came to a mysterious place: it was a forest full of giant pines that were dark red near the roots and looked strong, stately and calm. I realized that these are my ancestors taking me to some sacred and secret place. 

There was a cave in the center of the forest and then I realized that I am a tiny crystal of salt that will turn into a crystal some day. I realized that I am water. I realized that I am no different from my boyfriend and we are coming from this place. I was born a crystal a million times, and he was the sun shining upon me, telling me he loves me and playing sunny bunnies with me. 

Then I’ve had a weird vision that a giant block of marble has smashed me and has broken me. And I started crying and weeping, because that actually felt like I am destroyed, that I am broken, and that was so sad, and I couldn’t stop crying for myself. I never cried like that in my life. But there was help: my tears were water, and I felt that water is a very important thing, because all the worthy things in life come with sweat, tears and blood. And I felt that I need to be mourned for and symbolically die in the water just to be born again. I felt that water is connected to women a lot, and that it is very important to cry together, that it cures. So all the women of my clan that were ever born were crying with me and I felt very light again, I felt that I can live no matter how bad I was broken, that I have support, I felt that something very important, very ancient and very true was shared with me. They have seen everything and they are overwhelmed with dolor for the pain was present in this world for ever and it will never go away as long as the humans are physical creatures. But they were hope giving: nothing is broken forever, and no one shall be standing alone in her or his pain. That the pain goes away, if it’s shared and cried for. 

After this, the effects started to slowly go down… 

This trip was like a catharsis for me and I have never ever experienced anything close to its strength, beauty, and meaningfulness on beiger amounts of LSD or other psychedelic drugs. I hope I was able to express the vividness of this beautiful vision.",Addicted
"DMT- TIME AND RELATIVE DIMENSION IN SPACE
I guess I'll start with setup.
I did it at night outside on a blanket with a pillow and nearby candle for light. I took a good 10 minutes of quiet meditation while I prepareed my dmt, a dab rig with a titanium nail(ice cold water as I prefer). Now I'm not sure as to the exact amount as I don't have an accurate enough scale roughly.. jeez Idk 50 to possibly 100mg maybe more.

Now for the ""fun"" part.

I heat my nail, take my hit and lay down. The ringing and ""Blast Off"" sets in, I hold my hit as I reach the bright white light and I let out my hit....In my head from here. 
Immediately time go's in reverse, the hit goes back in I sit back up pick up the pipe and ""reverse inhale"" I heard one heartbeat..""boom boom"" And then hyperspace, like doctor strange ""open your eye"" scean but times infinity, moving at indescribable speed then suddenly a dead stop, middle of the universe floating. I'm drawn backwards(astral body to physical body) , slowly I hear the next heartbeat ""boom boom"" 
And I'm thrown into hyperspace again. Flying threw incredibly intricate geometric spirals that stretched on to infinity, my body did a color spectrum with the body's behind me each a mili second behind while those in front showed the future, I watched in line as those in front raised a hand to check and as it drew near mine raised, the sound was like a universal symphony that connected directly to how I felt deafening loud and tense like the middle of a grand symphony piece mirroring how I felt, I spent an entire lifetime ""there"".. I'm drawn backwards again spectrums falling into each other just enough time to hear the next heartbeat ""boom boom"" and be blasted off again.

I'm not sure if you're keeping count but I was.. That's only 3 heartbeats so far.

At that third heartbeat the realization set in, I'd just spent a life time in a second, this was supposed to last up to 20 min.. I don't know how else to explain it but I died at that realization, ego death, I no longer existed as my reality was thrown back and forth between an endless inexistence in infinitely different realities, and a single slow heartbeat, over and over in between each heartbeat. It felt like hundreds, maybe thousands of times.

At the end I caught a heartbeat in ""our universe"" I managed to hear a bird and used it to pull myself out..Id definitely seen enough for this session.

Back to ""reality""
After hearing the bird I got most of my wits back, I layed with my blindfold on for a few minutes then sat up and took off the blindfold.

My arms and legs were convulsing decently but I wasn't worried about that. The world around me was colored in rainbow fractals, the plaid blanket I sat on was quite indescribable,  Fast forward about 5 minutes and the visuals die down slowly along with the convulsions.

So in conclusion, what did I learn.

"My first ayahuasca experience
6:00 pm

A friend and I ingested 3g of Syrian Rue extract. We patiently chilled on a couch while some other friends were playing video games. We waited about an hour until we felt very high and relaxed, indicative of the MAOI contained within the Rue taking effect. 

7.00 pm

We sequestered ourselves in our friend’s bedroom, just us and our sober guide. We each laid down on a bed and ingested 50 mg of ultra-pure freebase DMT. Two other friends were tripping nuts in the other room on some potent shroom tea. 

7:30 pm

I begin to feel very heavy with waves of nausea. It was very difficult to move and felt like I was becoming locked into my own body, so much that it made me want to close my eyes. At this point, when I closed my eyes, I would begin to see more light than I knew was actually there. According to my guide, my pupils at this point were incredibly dilated. I felt like I needed to take a leak, and I was about 10 feet from the bathroom. It was incredibly difficult to walk there, and by the time I walked back to the bed I said, “I really do not want to move”. So, I laid back down and began to close my eyes. 

7:45 pm

By this time, I could feel something wanting to happen. When I closed my eyes, it felt like something was trying to embrace me. I kept telling myself “let go, I want more”. Little did I know, this was the lesson I was going to eventually learn. This is where things start to get a little weird. It was so easy for me to think nothing at all. My mind was completely free of clutter, and if I tried to control it and think for myself, I began to feel nauseous. But this feeling of nausea wasn’t bad at all, in fact I wanted it. I started to think “Man, I fucked up”, and I heard a voice saying, “It’s ok”. At this point, I opened my eyes and heaved into a trash can I had near me. Nothing came up, but the feeling of wanting to throw up was absolutely amazing. Every time I would do this, I would hear “It’s ok”, and if I did I felt amazing. It was as if when I went to throw up, I threw up all mental garbage. I literally never threw up anything physical. These waves persisted for a little while, getting ever more intense each time. “It’s ok”, that is what he kept telling me, and eventually I began to trust him. I began to get a little scared of this, but I didn’t want to tell him. But little did I know, I could hide nothing from him. He was literally my subconscious mind, my spirit. He knew everything, and boy did he not like it when I lied to him. More on this soon. 

7:59 pm

When I would open my eyes, the hallucinations would be so powerful it almost hurt to look at them. I would see everything turn into grand geometric patterns in an array of colors I had never seen before. It became so intense, that I had to close my eyes. I told myself “this is too intense, if I close my eyes I can ride it out”. That was bullshit. When I closed my eyes, I entered the spirit realm, I had no form. I was in a forest of lights in the presence of him, my spirit. I tried to close my eyes harder, but he told me “There is no such thing as an eye that is closed”. At this point, I knew the only way through the trip was directly through it. I could not hide from it. So I began to tell myself, “let go”. I looked him in the eye and said, “Take me, I will let you drive”. He responded with, “I’m always driving, but not yet”. Every time I tried to let him take me I would slowly come back to the real world, open my eyes and the cycle continued. The walls were flowing like rivers of cut jewels and they would morph into spectacular explosions of color. The colors I saw were too much for me to handle and I would close my eyes again. At this point, I’m getting more and more terrified with each passing wave. 

8:41 pm

8:41 pm is a very important time, because this was the point in the trip where he truly showed me who was in control. If I opened my eyes the hallucinations became so intense they hurt me. Everything evolved into a glorious explosion of colorful images I felt like my physical being could not bear witness to. I felt like If I kept watching, my eyes would burn. A small tether of myself to reality was still there, so I thought “maybe if I close my eyes, I can just ride this out”. Every time I tried to close my eyes I would go back to the spirit world. He would be standing there, motionless, with no words. I couldn’t look directly at him, it’s as if I was ashamed. I felt like I was not supposed to be there, and I was about to be punished. So, I opened my eyes again.

8:41 pm

My first sight was the digital clock in front of me, having never moved a second. Instantly, my vision was filled with moving, symmetrical patterns changing colors the whole way around. I felt the same way, like I was not supposed to see these images. I can’t even possibly begin to describe what they were. In fear, I closed my eyes again and there he was, having never moved an inch. I still could not look at him. I’m getting very scared, so much that I feel my physical stomach want to vomit. I began to tear up in his presence and he said again “It’s ok”. I wanted to throw up (mentally). Again, I awoke and dry heaved into a trash can. Nothing came out. Physically. However, I felt a wave of emotions leave my body with each heave. I laid back down and looked at the clock.

8:41 pm

Why was I stuck in this infinite time loop? All I wanted was to come back to reality, but he knew I was hiding something and refused to let me go. “You wanted this”, he told me. “Remember, there is no such thing as a closed eye”. I didn’t want this anymore. I had taken several powerful psychedelics in my life, but nothing came close to this. This was impossible to “ride out”. This cycle continued. I tried to open my eyes but was blinded by the power of the visions. I would close my eyes and try to figure a way out without looking at him. I was losing control and I was scared. For some reason, I couldn’t yet look him in the eye. I knew what he was doing. He would not let time continue to pass until I looked at what he had to show me. I literally felt like I was dying. I closed my eyes once again and HOPED I could just fall asleep, but there I was – standing in his presence again and again. I tried to look away but everywhere I looked, he was there. I could not hide from him. I asked him “Am I going to die?”. He responded with, “Well, what is life?”. At this point I said, “Ok, I don’t know if I want this anymore”. He just smiled at me and said, “Now it’s time”. At this point I began crying and fell to my knees. “I’m scared”, I told him. “Good”, he said. I opened my eyes one last time and saw the clock, but only for an instant.

8:41 pm

He embraced me and with his touch and I fell to pieces. Every part of my existence was in infinite shattered pieces on the ground made of light of a colors I still cannot perceive. Now, this is where things got really intense. I experienced complete ego death, what is known as a level 5 psychedelic experience. My entire being died at that moment. I completely lost control and for a moment my thoughts perished. There was no good, no bad. There was only everything, and everything was there, but at the same time, there was nothing. I know that sounds like a crazy drug induced experience (I mean it was), but that’s how it was. Once I completely let go of this world everything became peaceful. I was neither here nor there, happy nor sad.

I became surrounded by an infinity of versions of him, and I was having conversations with every one of them at the same time. Each one of them were going through every memory of my life, at the same time. I could remember being a baby held in my mother’s arms. I could remember going to kindergarten, I could remember every human encounter of my life. Every second of my life was being re-lived. An infinite number of him took an infinite number of pieces of my existence, like a shattered crystal. When I looked into the crystal I began reliving the experience. 

I asked him, “What does this mean?”. He picked up a memory, and I cannot remember what it was exactly, but it was a very fond, peaceful memory. I think I was a little boy taking a walk with my mother or something. Something that felt amazing. He said, “Do you like this one?”. I responded with “Yes”. He then gave me back that piece, as if he was starting to put me back together. He took a few more pieces that I liked and put them back. Then he took another piece. This one was a memory of some fight or something I had with someone. Again, I cannot remember what it was, but it was not a pleasant memory. He again asked, “Do you like this one?” I said “No, I don’t like this one”. He smiled and with a flick of his hands, the crystal vanished. He looked me in the eye and said, “Do you understand now”? Now, at this point, no I did not understand, and I was honest with him. I said, “I’m not sure”. He smiled again and reached out to embrace me. With a very gentle voice he says, “Look again”. I opened my eyes for a split second, and again the first image was of the digital clock in the room.

8:42 pm

He did it. I looked at what he had to show and in return he allowed time to pass. I now knew that if I was honest with him everything would be ok. I knew who he was. A religious person (which I am not) would say it was God. A hippie (which I kind of am) would say he was my spirit. A scientist (which I am) would say he was my subconscious mind. He was me, he was the very essence of me. He took no physical form, and I knew he came out of me. I could feel the wound on my body from where he was separated from me. I knew I was not supposed to be in his presence at that time, that he was never supposed to leave me. But it was good that he did, because after the fact I knew what he was telling me. I was in his realm, the realm of my being. The one who controls my heartbeat, my breathing. He was the one telling the enzymes in my body to work, my cells to grow and multiply. He controlled everything. He knew everything. He was everything. 

He continued putting pieces of me back together, but he didn’t finish. He stopped, and I asked why. He said, “Because you don’t need me to do this”. He was me, and I was him. He knew because I knew. I knew because he knew. I understood for the first time. He and I were one. 

The past few years of my life have been lived in horrible depression. I joined a graduate program for a degree I ultimately didn’t want, and I let many people convince me to stay much longer than I wanted. This led to a life I almost didn’t want to live. I wanted to teach, but I let this program try to change me into a researcher. I never wanted that. He never wanted that. We never wanted that. I was depressed not because of anything anyone else did. I was not depressed because of anything but the fact that I became separated from him. He, deep down, always knew I was on the wrong path from the moment we started. But I continued. He never fought back. He never fought back because he is better than me. My body is a vehicle, and I thought I was driving. Come to find out, I am just a passenger. He is the driver, and he always has been the driver. Sometimes in my life, I try to be cocky and grab the wheel from the passenger side. He doesn’t fight back. He allows me to steer us in a new direction without fighting back. Instead, he says nothing. He does nothing. JUST like when I was stuck in the time loop. If I didn’t surrender to him, I was stuck. I was in hell. I was in non-existence. That is what hell is, when you become completely separated from your soul, from the one driving. 

Ayahuasca is not about the physical visions. It’s about what you feel, what you “see”, but not with your eyes. As the trip continued I became happier and more at peace with each passing wave. I had yet to open my eyes yet. At point, I was ready for what he wanted to show me. I gave him complete control and it was amazing. Out of nowhere, he appears again. This time there is only one of him. He is looking me in the eyes and this time, we are both smiling. He went to embrace me and this time, I went to embrace him. And when I did, his final words to me were “It’s ok, it will always be ok”. His being began to seep back into mine and in an instant my eyes opened.

9:30 pm

I jumped out of bed and noticed the hallucinations stopped. I was drenched in sweat, but I was sober. I felt like I just awoke from an incredible powernap. My guide said my eyes were completely black, I had no iris left because my pupils were so dilated. I immediately looked in the mirror and I saw him in my reflection. He gave me a comforting smirk that I normally give people and he winked at me. My soul and I are in tune again. I felt so at peace I just wanted to tell everyone. So, I began writing down every piece I could remember. Still to this day, when I look in the mirror I’m happy. Because I see him. And he sees me. And we like each other again. He always liked me. I can’t say the same for me. That’s why he is better than me. If I continue to follow my heart and listen to him, everything will be ok. I know that now.",Addicted
"First mushroom psychedelic experience: 2.5g [mushshrooms]
**Some background info:** I bought a quarter of shrooms before the start of school this year because my friend P and I had been thinking about trying psychedelics. P, our other friend R, and I all smoked weed occasionally last year, but R didn't think it was the greatest idea to try any other drug besides weed and alcohol. I had been talking to P and it seemed like he definitely wanted to eat the shrooms with me, and R also said that he might consider it. We all arrived at school and when we got to R's room, I asked them if they wanted to eat the shrooms. They both said no which bummed me out a bit, but I felt that I was ready for the experience and really wanted to try them that day, so I ate about 2.5g from the quarter that I had.

**The trip:** After ingesting the shrooms at ~6pm we stuck around in R's room for around 30 minutes and we decided to go meet some friends and walk around campus. As I walked outside I wasn't experiencing any intense visuals, but the world around me seemed more vibrant and exceedingly beautiful. I let out a cry of joy and expressed to P, R and the rest of our friends how beautiful everything looked. As we walked through campus I didn't experience any other visuals/feelings but I ran into another acquaintance of mine which I had last seen when I had taken MDMA during the summer. I made a comment to R that I thought it was odd that both the last two times I had seen this acquaintance I had been on some sort of drug. R told me that maybe that meant I'm doing drugs too often. At the time I brushed his comment off but later on in the trip it would come back to haunt me. We saw a sign for free tea in one of the university buildings, so we stopped walking to decide if we wanted to go inside. This was the first time we stopped walking since we left R's room, and I finally started to experience some intense visuals. I looked at the brick wall of one of the university buildings, and the mortar in between the bricks was flowing like a river while the lines between all of the bricks were waving back and forth. I sat looking at the wall for a few minutes, lost within the intricate designs that were revealing themselves before me, and then P and R told me to come inside so we could all get tea together.

 I would guess it had been around 1.5 hours since I had taken the shrooms at this point, and I was having strong visuals. P's girlfriend  H had joined us a few minutes before, and I decided I didn't want to talk to anyone who I didn't know so P and R went to get tea while I stayed with H. H asked me to describe to her what I was experiencing and I started talking about how I could see the lines in between the tiles flowing like rivers and the texture of the tile flowing together like waves. By the time I started describing this to her though completely new visuals had already sprung up such as the floor breathing along with me and the colors of the tiles changing. As we were waiting for P and R to come back a guy I met once the year before came up to me and started talking to me. I could barely keep eye contact because whenever he moved his face I would see trails and it would look like he had 4 or even more eyes. His face was bulging in and out and it was extremely disconcerting the amount of detail that I could see. Thankfully P and R returned soon and we left the building. H wanted to go to a restaurant so we decided we would go to this authentic Chinese restaurant nearby. As we walked from the University building to the restaurant, the ground around the breathes kept breathing, and I remember thinking how fitting it was that the ground was breathing, since trees are in the ground and they are also breathing.

When we arrived the waitress seemed very rushed and in a bad mood, and for the rest of the meal I kept wondering whether she was a student at the University or if all she did was work at this restaurant. Two more of H's friends came to the restaurant as well as my friend D. D knew I had eaten the shrooms but H's two friends didn't, so I asked R to tell H to tell her friends that I was tripping (it seemed necessary that I tell them and I thought this was the best way). Once everyone knew that I was tripping I felt a lot more comfortable and we all decided what we wanted to order. R and I ordered some type of chicken dish, and when it arrived we were all given chopsticks to eat with. I can't use chopsticks when I'm sober, and it was extremely difficult for me to pick up any food since the chopsticks kept changing in length. I decided to not eat anything and instead look at all of the designs that were around me. The chopsticks were metal and they had dragons carved into them that seemed to be moving and ready to burst out. I moved my gaze to the table where there was a smudge that was in the shape of a monkey. I would move the smudge around with my fingers and 'play' with the monkey, I entertained myself for the duration of the meal by doing this and listening to the conversations that were going on. 

We left the restaurant and headed to H's friend's house. H's friend said how awesome it would be if we could all smoke, so I told him that I had some weed that he could roll and smoke if he wanted, but that I didn't want to smoke. H's friend and R went to smoke outside while H, D, P, and I stayed inside. I brought some glowsticks and bubbles from home and I played with them while I waited for everyone to come back inside. The bubbles of air within the glowsticks were incredibly smooth and mesmerizing, and both the glowsticks and bubbles created trails that were multiple inches long when I moved them around. I asked P if he still wanted to try DMT with me in the future, and he said in a mocking tone that only if we injected it. I told him that you couldn't inject DMT (which is wrong I later learned) and asked him why he had changed his mind about psychedelics. I guess P had decided against doing any psychedelics because H disapproved. P and R are both in the same fraternity, and they had to go set up a party, so we left H and her friends while P, R, D, and I went back to P's apartment. 

I was left alone in P's apartment since P and R had to go set up a party, and D's friend needed him to go be his wingman. The guy I had bought the shrooms highly recommended that I listen to music during my trip, so I pulled out my headphones and started listening to Bach's St. John Passion. I'm not sure if it was the dark mood of the music, or something else, but I was completely put off by the sound coming from my headphones, it didn't sound real enough to me. I went into P's room and decided to lie down on his bed and just think. I started thinking about what it really means to be alive, what the point of humanity is, and I came to the conclusion that our whole existence is absurd. I saw myself being taken away by police and put in jail for life for the rest of the shrooms that I had on me, I saw myself being eaten by a cheetah and left to die in the desert, and then I saw myself floating in space within view of the earth. I felt completely worthless at this point, I kept thinking back to what the guy that sold me the shrooms had told me, that some people have suicidal thoughts on shrooms. It was constantly in the back of my mind, and I was desperately scrambling to try to find some meaning to my life so that I wouldn't have to kill myself due to the futility of it all. I thought back to my friends, they had all left me alone, they don't care about me I thought. Then I thought about my family. My dad cared about me more than anything else in the world, but I realized that even if I died before he did, he would also die eventually and his pain would also disappear. My mind was completely dark now, and from somewhere inside I sensed a light shining brighter and brighter. I realized that it was my sister, my best friend in the entire world. She knew that I smoked weed and drank, but she didn't like it at all. If she knew that I had tried psychedelics she would be heartbroken (I disagree with her that psychedelics are bad though). I decided that the meaning of my life was to ensure her happiness, because she was the most important person to me. To ensure her happiness, I would have to stop doing drugs so I could be the 'perfect rolemodel' that I had always been. I started envisioning cliche and dramatic versions of me throwing the rest of my shrooms and weed down a river while holding hands with all of my friends, but then I thought back to what R had said about me doing too many drugs lately. Thinking that I had found my purpose in life, I immediately went to the toilet and flushed the rest of my weed and shrooms down the toilet. I felt liberated and reborn. D came back and I talked to him for a while about my new decision to not do drugs anymore. We went to grab some food since my appetite was coming back now that I had passed the peak of my trip. We talked for a while about life and then I went back to my apartment to sleep. 

**Looking back on the trip:** For the few days after the trip I tried to make sense of everything that had occurred, and I realized that the meaning of my life was not to ensure my sister's complete happiness, and that even if she didn't like me doing drugs, I enjoy it very much. I decided that my new philosophy of life would be to maximize my own pleasure while minimizing other's discomfort. The existentialist thoughts I had during the trip about life being an absurd and meaningless thing are still with me now, and I have decided to do some reading to try to find meaning. 

I see more beauty in every day life now, and in situations that would have bored me to death before, I just start contemplating life and endlessly entertain myself. I doubt I will ever find absolute meaning in life, but for now I am content with being happy and making others happy as well. ",Addicted
"LSD and Laser Tag! (LONG)
Hey everyone! I recently started writing out my trips, and I tend to write in a more storytelling fashion, so sorry it's so long! I really enjoyed writing this though, let me know if you guys want more!

*Note: All names have been changed bc i'd rather not post my friends actual names and I doubt they would either.
Edit: Sorry for the wall of text, i have it spaced out in paragraphs but they don't stay after I click save.

 The day started out more or less the same as any other. It was the friday of spring break, senior year. I had very recently been busted (again) for smoking weed, this was a big bust for my parents- they found the gold mine. They got everything. Lighters, weed, bowl, grinder, my friends bong… it was not a pretty sight as my dad broke everything one by one. That was four days before this. But we already had plans to do this and we weren’t going to back out through simple bullshit like that. What we had was a large amount of LSD that was not going to waste. I had only done it twice before, so I thought, hey, why not just try three tabs at once? Yeah. 
	
Basically, it went like this. Rob and I both took three, John took two, and Peter took one. John had an empty house for the entire break, so we made our “home base” there. We finally all met up around 2 pm and popped them in. Our trip sitter, Logan, wanted to go smoke a little weed, so we chilled and talked outside with him while he sparked up out of his elephant bubbler. We all smoke a lot (except Rob) so it’s not like he was the only stoner there, but we all decided to skip the weed on the come up. 

The excitement of popping the tabs quickly wore off as the “what now?” feeling set in that I always get while waiting for the acid to take over. In a brilliant stroke of genius, we decided to pile in the car and head for Menards. Yeah, you read that right. But hear me out - Rob had brought some Albanese gummy bears and while we were in the car (initially headed for Walgreens) he shared some with us and after we converted everyone in the car to the church of Albanese, Rob told us that they sometimes sell them at Menards, so there you go.

	
About halfway to Menards, we’re all talking and listening to music when we started to feel the come up beginning. I remember thinking to myself “fuck it, here we go” when we got out of the car. We headed inside and immediately my anxiety levels jumped. Not to unhandleable levels, mind you, but more of a “okay, fuck, i’m coming up on a shit load of acid in a public building.” Almost instantly, John and I lost everyone. In a roughly minute long search that was stretched to an hour, we found them, near the candy. Duh. But there was one problem - the distinct lack of Albanese. 

	
Of course, instead of leaving the store like normal people, we all immediately jumped to the conclusion that we HAD to leave with something, otherwise it’d look like we stole something. So we all -INDIVIDUALLY- buy a giant bag of gummy lifesavers. In retrospect, it probably looked weirder for us to all buy that than if we left with nothing at all, but that's beside the point. When we made it back outside it had started to lightly rain, so we ran across the parking lot to get to the car. Once the last door slammed, I remember a deafening silence rang in my ears. After a minute, we all burst out laughing. “Did we just fucking do that?” “What the fuck?” “That was so dumb!” We were saying to each other.
	
And that was just the come up.

	
We continued to drive around for a little, enjoying the come up, listening to music, watching the rain fall, and just hanging out. It was nice. Then we decided we had killed enough time, and it was time for the main event - Laser Tag. This was not our smartest decision, but our reasoning was “but man. How awesome would it be to say that we went laser tagging on acid?” As flawed as that reasoning may be, i’d say it was worth it, because hey - I went laser tagging on acid.


We pulled into the parking lot, and the jaunty happiness that was inside the car quickly dissipated as Logan parked. He turned off the car, and an audible collective breath could be heard. I don’t know who said it, but someone asked “so are we good?” After a few more breaths, we came to the conclusion that yes, we were good. We hopped out of the car and headed for the door, and immediately passed it and went into the alley behind it because we all got incredibly nervous. Writing this, it seems hilarious that a group of 18 year old dudes had to collect themselves in the back alley outside of a shitty laser tag arena. 



Eventually, we got our act together and headed inside, and this is where I have to give a major shout out to Logan. As you’ll see, Logan (with his Logan MagicTM) somehow got us through everything, and we hailed him as a prophet. He told us to chill out on the benches as he went to talk to the lady at the desk. He came back to find us staring at the tile floor, complete with trippy designs as well as LED lights running across the ground in every direction, as per laser tag standards. This is when I started to hallucinate. The ground itself looked like it was warping as the lights danced over and under different parts of the floor. Logan pulled us out of the trance telling us the next game was in 15 minutes. 


Of course, 15 minutes in Lucy time is an incredible patch of time, and in that time we just sat there, tripping, in a Laser Tag lobby area. My mom texted me and I was able to reply like a normal human being astonishingly, and with Logan double checking my texts, I was able to navigate through the conversation scot free. At one point, we had to go up to the lady at the front desk and tell her what we wanted our names to be for the game. I chose “Sly” and felt so out of place standing on the little block to reach the desk saying Sly in a serious voice to the lady. Finally, our time came and we were directed into the pre-game room. It was covered in dark lights, completely fucking with my vision, and as the underpaid game supervisor went over the rules, Logan just kept making me crack up. When it came time to take the “oath” that you would play fair, Logan would repeat the opposite of what she said back to her, which was a fairly mundane joke, but I was losing my shit. 


I had one more encounter with staff as I had put the vest on backwards, but then we were thrown into the jungle. Lasers flew everywhere, and after a brief “Uh, what now?” moment, we headed off into the unknown. I immediately lost almost everyone besides Logan, and he guided me through, telling me we were on a secret mission in ‘Nam. I really started to get into it, it was really fun and took a lot of anxiety away to play pretend. We’d run from cover to cover, shooting anything that moved. We’d fall over when we got shot and the other would have to help him up. We eventually found Peter and John, who were just slowly walking around staring at the walls, and it was at this point that i remembered that I was on an insane amount of drugs. 


I remembered that I wanted to try something, and I put my earbuds in and just hit play. “Let It Happen” by Tame Impala came on, and it took me over. I ran away from my friends, letting the music take me wherever it wanted to. I shot, ducked, and dove through the dark smoke until I ran into Logan again. Taking out an earbud, I simply said “leave me!” and ran the other direction. I felt consumed, like I was in Apocalypse Now and the forest was taking me. I set up shop in a tower, shooting anyone that tried to come up and raining hell on everyone below. Eventually I realized that my gun wasn’t firing anymore, and then Logan tapped me on the shoulder and told me the game was over. He hadn’t even left my side, I don’t think.


After a lengthy battle of getting my earbuds untangled from the other wires on the gun and vest, we headed out. As we came back outside, we all remarked about how nice it was to be back outside and its so amazing outside. Except it wasn’t. It was freezing, raining, and overcast. Again, we ran to the car and as the last door slammed closed, a moment of silence was followed by a well deserved laugh. “We fucking laser tagged on acid!!” “WHY?!” “BECAUSE WE CAN” I remember people saying, and one of them might have been me. With spirits higher than ever, we started up the car and headed out, recounting our war stories. Rob hadn’t been sighted the entire match and didn’t divulge much, and he told me later his trip was not a great one, which sucks. As we were driving, the raindrops slowly rolled along the windows as the setting sun hit them, providing us with an amazing view as my trip continued to intensify.


I can actually pinpoint the moment that my trip jumped up another final notch. I was talking to John and Rob, and John pointed to my hat. I looked at it, and my eyes widened in disbelief. The patterns, depiction of moose, and colors, they were all moving independently of the hat they were sewed onto, and their colors were amazing to say the least. We were losing it about how magical that was for us and how all it was was us brushing up against sweaty puerto ricans with pokemon hats, and how when we crossed the bridge back into park ridge it was like a bridge from average middle class minorities to upper middle class whites and just how hilarious that fact was. I hung my head out of the car as the rain slowed, letting the cool wind wash over me. It really was an incredible time.


We pulled up to John's house and as I got out I was talking to Logan and Peter about how what I was experiencing right now was quintessential LSD. I remember saying “One tab is fun. Two tabs is amazing. Three tabs? This shit is ACID.” We were able to finally relax when we came back in, and this is when my mind opened wide fucking open. I was in full on “revelation” mode, convinced everyone in the house were prophets and that I had figured “it” all out. I disavowed capitalism and the two party system, and realized I wanted to create something for a living. That is actually true, and I still believe I was meant to create to this day. 


Though this is where the majority of the trip took place, nothing really of importance took place. We talked. And talked. And talked. We were talking about life, how to be happy, what it means to be successful, and stuff like that. Eventually, we ordered a pizza, and by that I mean Logan ordered us a pizza. When it came, we barely ate any of it and realized we all just really liked the idea of pizza but none of us were really hungry. As the sun set, I felt my anxiety start to rise, and Rob and I took a walk to clear our minds. We were both getting some bad vibes for some reason, and we went to a park and did a couple laps around it and that really helped me. At about 10, a few other people came over (who I was not terribly familiar with at the time) and wasn’t really digging it. Rob left shortly after, followed by Logan, Peter and I. I got back around 10:45, definitely still tripping. I talked to both of my parents about it, and my brother came into the computer room where I was at asking me what the hell I was doing home (he knew I had taken the acid). He also said my pupils were still insanely huge. I chuckled to myself for a while after that. I couldn’t believe I did all that. It was incredible, and here I was, winding down the day with a nice Matimi0 stream, watching him play Rainbow 6. Whenever he held still in game though, I would still see doorframes wobbling, sights not lining up, and other little things to remind me that yes, I was still tripping. I went to “bed” around one, because I had work the next day, but I couldn’t sleep. I was still getting close eyed hallucinations, and I just tossed and turned my way to morning and headed into work. I told Germaine how crazy of a day I had (he’s my shift leader, but we talk about drugs a lot) so he told me I could take it easy today. I spent my time at work just reliving my recent, ever fading memory of yesterday. 12/10 Would do again. And I will.

"1000 mcg trip report
## 1000 mcg trip?  What could possibly go wrong?

([Original appears here](https://www.trippingly.net/lsd/2018/6/5/1000-mcg-lsd-trip)) \<\- includes some images, etc.

**The Come Up**

My friends had varying experience with LSD:  1 friend (who will be called John) had tripped a total of seven or so times, another (Dave) a single time (actually 2 days before this trip), and the other (Kelly) was dropping for the first time for her birthday.

The day seemed all too perfect for anything to mess up, despite the fact that during this time in my life, I had had a myriad of personal issues and insecurities that could possibly lead to bad experiences.  


I'm starting to get slightly uneasy even thinking about the experience I am about to describe.  


Around 3:30 P.M., my friend Kelly picked me up from my house. Dave was also in the car. We drove to another friend's house, where my personal stash of acid was sitting in the freezer. The LSD was dropped onto sugar cubes. Our plan was to drive to our friend yet another friend's house and enjoy the ride in a safe setting.

I walked into his house and saw a couple of my friends there. We briefly conversed and smoked a bowl of top\-quality CBD\-rich Sativa marijuana (an anti\-psychotic chemical in marijuana that reduces anxiety) for a few minutes as a ""way to ease me into my trip"".

I pulled a whopping seven sugar cubes out of the freezer and shoved them in my mouth, then licked a bunch of sugar crumbles off the foil which came from the edges of the 15 sugar cubes I had in my stash. This was a total of around 1000 micrograms.

My friends were a bit shocked I was willing to go that far, but they already were aware of my tendency to consume large quantities of psychedelic drugs. I talked with them for another 10 minutes or so, then I went back to the car. On my way to the car, I noticed I was starting to feel increasingly disoriented. It wasn't that euphoric, confusing sort of disorientation, it was more of a ""I'm losing fucking my mind"" sort of thing. I felt slightly anxious, but I assumed the negative feelings would pass as soon as the acid took full effect. A couple minutes after I got in the car, Dave ate 2 sugar cubes, and Kelly ate 1.  


The experience was about to get very, very ugly.  


To give you guys a little perspective on the unfathomable effects of 1000 mic doses, here is a quote from the nobel prize winning chemist Kary Mullis that ingested 1000 micrograms for his first dose:   


*""When you take 1000 micrograms of LSD, you don't know you've taken anything. It just feels like that's the way it is. You might suddenly find yourself sitting on a building in Egypt three thousand years ago, watching boats on the Nile.""*  


Yes, it is THAT FUCKING CRAZY.  


Ten minutes into the car ride and twenty minutes after eating the sugar cubes, I was rapidly losing all touch with reality. I started wondering what the fuck was going on around me, and why I was feeling so uncomfortable. I started telling my friends I was really scared, and the intense anxiety was gripping every single fiber of my body. I thought I was going die and that this trip was going to last until the end of eternity. By the minute, I was starting to panic more. This was only the beginning of an unimaginable nightmare that would show me the ""dark"" side of LSD and completely change my opinion about the drug in general.

📷

**It Hits Hard**   


25 minutes after taking the sugar cubes, we arrived at JAC's house. By that time, I was stumbling all over the place and I was already having severe visual distortion. All movements were followed by strobing trails composed of detailed patterns, kaleidoscopes, and rainbows. These visuals that I would have usually considered beautiful were now viewed as a reminder that I was in the middle of a trip that I so desperately wanted to end.   


When I got inside his house, I saw a few more of my friends sitting on the couch. My body temperature had elevated to the point I thought I was burning alive. I was completely out of my body and almost felt like I was on a high dose of ketamine. I felt embarrassed because I obviously looked like I couldn't handle my shit; maybe this was just an extreme amplification of my general self\-esteem issues. Their faces were assuming demonic forms. I fled to JAC's room. I was already starting to experience ego loss. I was going in and out of consciousness.  


This is the point where I lost track of time, so there is no point of trying to estimate anything....  


JAC followed me to his room and did his best to comfort me and talk me out of my bad trip. It was a completely ineffective attempt. A couple minutes later, I started crying hysterically. Everything was getting darker. I fell into the most depressive state of my life, combined with the most acute sense of panic I've ever experienced. The floor was covered in spiraling kaleidoscopes that were rapidly shifting colors. I heard thousands of voices call me names like ""pussy"" and ""bitch"". The room wreaked of sewage and feces. This was the most negative emotion a human being could ever fathom. I so desperately wanted to stop the trip but I was immobilized and unable to move.

📷

I realized that the voices were of all of the people I resented in my life the most. Cartoon blood was all over the ceiling and the walls. My vision seemed to stretch off into infinity. I was hallucinating so much I couldn't fucking believe it. I could see many different events of my life playing out as if it was waking reality. Try and imagine being inside of a Saw movie first hand, but a thousand times more horrifying and traumatic. There was a moment in which my mind would shoot out of my body two feet in front of me and then return into my body, and this looped over and over again for what felt like FOREVER at an impossible speed. Time was non\-existent, and a second felt like FOREVER. Not hours, not days, but an infinite amount of time.   


I kept hearing this bizarre futuristic noise that sounded like a computer glitching. The whole room was flashing as if something was flicking the on switch for a lamp up and down repeatedly. My jaw was rapidly vibrating like I had taken 300 mg of MDMA (I always get major jaw clenching from acid). I had full\-blown synaethsia. Everything was one, everything was infinitely interconnected. I would look at the walls and become the walls. I would look at the floor and then become the floor, looking back at my body in a dissociative fashion. I was unable to differentiate any part of the outside world from my own physical body. The concept of ""I"" was now a mere construct of my mind, and ""I"" was nothing more than a complex bundle of atoms and molecules.   


Somehow, just a little while after this part of the trip, I regained some degree of consciousness. I stumbled to his backyard, where a group of 8 or so people were sitting and I was watching the sky and everything in my external environment turning black and red. I could barely see anything, my vision was almost completely shot. I forget that I even had a body at this point and I had absolutely no control over my muscular movements. I was in this ""survival mode"" where my mind was on autopilot and and I had no idea that I was on drugs. I lost balance and fell backward onto the ground. I continued to see more incredible vortexes of matrix\- style numbers and letters spurt out from every direction.   


During my friends' attempts to help restore me to sanity, they asked if I knew what time it was. I responded with ""8:00 A.M."" when it was late in the afternoon. That was quite enough of a response to prove I was completely and utterly going nuts and there was no real way to help me.   


Once night fell, I was full\-on peaking in JAC's room. I began to literally have no idea who I was, where I was, or what drug I was on (or what drugs were in the first place). I knew that I was going to die and nothing could be done to stop it. At some point at the beginning of the peak, I realized that I could not recognize the room I was in. Suddenly, I started seeing several cop cars pull into the room and put their sirens on. Yellow caution tape magically appeared around them as well. This was one of my worst nightmares coming to life before my very eyes. There was a line of already\-arrested criminals in handcuffs next to the cop cars, and they were all complaining that I had snitched on them for some unspecified reason. I knew I was in for absolute hell. Before I could see what was going to happen next, everything started fading to white. I could see nothing but burning white light, like I was looking directly at the sun from 100 feet away. What I saw was.....the ultimate truth. The answer to every question. The reason reality is the way that it is. I existed within the past, present, and future simultaneously. I couldn't see my own hand in front of my face. I dissolved into infinity. I was existing in an infinite number of dimensions, living an infinite number of lives simultaneously for an infinite amount time. Though my memory of this is hazy, I believe I re\-lived every event of my entire life during the peak. I could fit our entire universe into a period at the end of a sentence. Time was a point of nothingness. I was everything, yet I was nothing. I was in pure ecstasy. I felt the unconditional love of the universe penetrating every pore of my body. If only this could have lasted forever. I suppose this was a taste of the beautiful part of ego death, but my stay in this ineffable place was cut short when I was suddenly catapulted into hyperspace, where I experienced every ounce of pain any human being could ever possibly experience at one time. The love rapidly shifted to evil in its purest definition. I saw many miserable people I had seen throughout my life, including the homeless and starving. My brain's sensory filter was gone; every last bit of information that could physically be processed at once was flowing through my head at light speed.   


I was dropped out of hyperspace directly into a hallucinatory prison facility. I saw hundreds of pitbulls, white supremacists, and naked black men running around. It was a state of sheer pandemonium. I have never been so unbelievably horrified in my entire life. I was now sure that this is where I would die. I was taken to the showers where I was bitten repeatedly by pitbulls and raped by the white supremacists and black men simultaneously. I was sobbing hysterically screaming for it stop. It was physical and emotional torture beyond your wildest dreams. I felt every single sensation, including their penises in my anus and the razor\-sharp teeth of the vicious dogs.   


Who knows how long this actually went on for, but eventually this torture ended and I was back in JAC's room. I saw all of my friend's faces covered in knife wounds and deep, bleeding cuts. Puddles of blood were all over the room. My joints were still in severe pain from the physical torture I had just experienced.  


I looked at the clock, and it read 9:00 P.M. (or something along those lines).   


Minutes after I came back to earth, I realized that the purpose for human existence was to love. Love is our higher purpose. I now understood that the ego I had developed my entire life was an illusion all along. Our egos push us away from our ability to feel compassion towards others. As your ego fades away, you slowly dissolve into pure unadulterated LOVE. The illusion of separation created by our egos has been the root cause of suffering all across our planet, and sadly this is the reason the majority of the world kills each other for absurd purposes like religion and resources. Religions like Christianity hide behind the idea that there is an afterlife because they are afraid of death. There is nothing to fear, because when you die there is no “you” to fear anything. THE ONLY THING THAT SEPARATES US FROM OTHER FORMS OF LIFE IS OUR ABILITY TO THINK. Our ego is composed of our thoughts. When we stop relying on our ego, we cannot experience negative emotions. When we stop thinking, our ego ceases to exist, and then we can live a life of pure love, peace, and prosperity. The more we rely on our ego, the more we push ourselves away from the moment which is all. Nothing outside the moment we are in right now will ever exist. Yesterday never is, and tomorrow will never be. Time is infinite. The past, present, and future are all occurring simultaneously. We are merely observers. Free will is an illusion.   


This was by far the most profound experience of my entire life.  


I quickly forgot all of these things within 15 minutes of the peak ending. I didn't fully understand the lessons I learned for until months had passed after the trip.  


**The Next Day**

The next day was easily the worst day of my life (excluding the trip). I felt so self\-conscious about myself that suicide was all I could think about. I was thoroughly convinced that I had ruined my life permanently. During ego death, I became aware of the severity of my many mental disorders. I realized that throughout my entire life, I had been looked down upon as the ""special kid"". I had not been aware of this until that moment. I felt like the most inferior form of life on the face of the earth.   


After I got home I burst into tears. I even thought my family felt sorry for me and had pitied me my whole life because they thought I was a moron.   


I had a psychotic break for weeks afterward. This was easily the most traumatic thing I have ever gone through in my entire life and has left a lasting mark on me that I carry to this day. It's been over 6 months now and I think about this trip every day of my life. It's nothing any human being ever deserves to go through and I would never wish it on my worst enemy.   


Over time this trip has had a profound impact on all areas of my life, in both positive and negative ways.  


**Positive**: I have very close friends now and rather than the ""special kid"", many people now view me as a very insightful and intelligent person. Before this experience, I had very, very few friends. I wasn't close friends with the ones mentioned in this report, but we chilled every once in a while. I now know what true friendship is. I meet new people all the time. I suspect I used to have a mild form of autism and this trip literally eradicated it. My entire family has mentioned multiple times that I'm a transformed person. I have fully developed social skills. I truly believe LSD is able to cure mental disorders and the scientific community needs to conduct research on this. I act normally now. I view everyone I meet as a part of my own consciousness, which lets me act much more empathetically. I've earned excellent grades at my community college and have grown tremendously \- multiple people have commented that I'm an entirely different person. I've taken up buddhism and adopted a very spiritual lifestyle.   


**Negative**: Several months ago, I was diagnosed with bi\-polar disorder. I suspect I was already pre\-disposed to this condition and the trip brought it out. I still have mental flashbacks nearly every day and have been scarred by experience. I frequently have nightmares about this trip. My thoughts can be very scattered and clouded at times. My thinking is very impaired on some days, but it's very sporadic. I've learned how fucked up our world is, and sometimes I feel that ignorance is bliss. Our society disgusts me. I think that the human race is a joke.  


I am going say one thing: DO NOT take a high dose of acid unless you have a proper set and setting or it can turn into the worst nightmare of your entire life. 300 micrograms is more than enough to have a spiritual experience. 1000\+ micrograms does not provide a near\-death experience, it provides a BEYOND\-death experience.   


Heed my warning. Don’t make the mistakes I did. YOU ARE NOT INVINCIBLE. LSD is a seriously powerful drug and it has the ability to FUCK you like nothing you could ever conceive of. In fact, after this experience I firmly believe it is the most powerful drug known to the human race. I've smoked 150 mg\~(approx) of DMT at once (7 consecutive enormous hits) and the intensity could not come close to what I described in this trip report.

"Sex on Shrooms
I have tripped a lot in my life, generally with a romantic partner, and have often contemplated having sex during the trips, but until recently have been unsuccessful - it is as though arousal is a strange and inaccessible state when so much else is going on in our minds, not to mention that sex often seems like it would take a lot of effort and coordination that we don't quite possess while having our minds blown by the psychedelics.

Recently though, my boyfriend and I took approximately 3g each of shrooms. For about the first couple of hours of our trip we enjoyed drawing, watching music videos, and laughing with abandon as we usually do. Then we decided it was time for a change of scenery and went to the bedroom. Unlike a previous occasion on which we decided to have sex during a trip, it happened completely naturally without conscious prompting; somehow our shared trip culminated into a beautiful, blossoming, new state of arousal.

While we had sex, my closed eye visuals were of amazing colours and patterns that morphed and grew and expanded and deepened, it was as if I could feel the way the oxytocin and dopamine of the sex affected the psilocybin, how they danced together in my brain - much more intense than the closed eye visuals I had before we started having sex. At one point, a recurring image of two snakes wrapped tightly around eachother played in my mind, I felt as if we were those snakes, and it was beautiful. I felt so completely connected, so primal. I felt like we were animals perfectly expressing the natural order of the universe and ecosystem, that this was LOVE and the purest most beautiful, intense, blissful expression of it. Somehow I was introspecting about sex and our love and fully immersed in the moment simultaneously. It felt like it was beyond ""sex"" or even ""lovemaking"", it felt practically spiritual. It was truly amazing and absolutely unforgettable. If you find yourself in the right state of mind with the right person during a mushroom trip, I would definitely say that having sex in the midst of it is an awesome experience.",Addicted
"My 10 day benzo binge
Normally I would call myself a responsible drug user. I smoked cannabis habitually for a while and took other stuff maybe once or twice a month, particularly psychedelics. I love pharmacology and biochemistry, and study it in my free time. Sometimes I like to try new substances - some I like, some I don't, but I never got into a habit of doing stuff every day. I had received random BTC and shopped around, I had tried most classes of substances already, except opiates and benzos. Opiates I have too much respect for right now, psychedelics are starting to get a bit boring, so I went ahead and got 20x2mg Clonazepam from a really nice vendor. I received 30, gotta love the people out there.

I feel like a warning is in order, because this whole story shows a lot of reckless and stupid behavior. Do not do this under any circumstance, it was stupid and a huge waste... I fully expect haters to hate, people to laugh at me, and that's okay. I regret it for health reasons, but it was a fuckload of fun, yet not something I repeat on doing ever again. I don't believe I was in any physical danger during any of this and I never felt any bad physical side symptoms, but feel free to correct me on that.

It's a long text, so bear with me. Most of this was written on the go while under the influence but edited multiple times for spelling and clarity. I would enjoy if you read the entirety of it, there's some passages that show interesting psychological tendencies in my opinion, and it's a pretty raw report without much fluff. 

For the TL;DR people I recommend Day 1, 8,9 and 10.

**THE GRAND TOTAL**

* 60mg Clonazepam (1 kpin = 2mg Clonazepam)
* 110mg of 2C-C (about half oral/half nasal - ouch)
* 200-300ug LSD (4x 60-80ug blotter)
* ~1700mg of about 60-70% pure MDMA (70% of that insufflated because I'm a fucking fiend when it comes to snorting stuff, the rest eaten)
* Spilled 1.5g of that MDMA somewhere or whatever I don't know???
* Maybe 8g of varying quality weed, who the fuck weights weed?
* 2 bottles of Wine
* Around 30 Cups of Coffee
* 10g of Vitamin C
* Over a gram of 5-HTP
* 60g of tobacco (that's 1.5 packs or I don't know... 120 cigs)

**Day 1** - Thursday - *8mg Clonazepam, 1g of Cannabis, 20mg of 2C-C, 120mg MDMA*

18:30 I had no idea of the potency of the kpins, so I took 1mg. I felt this was a reasonable dose to test the strength of the material. 

19:30 Not feeling much, I probably underestimated how long they take to kick in, so I took another 1mg.

19:45 Feeling pretty good, a bit woobly, I decide to say fuck it and go out and to buy some weed. The dealer gave me a funny look, like are you okay? I felt pretty sober, so we parted ways.

20:40 I got back home, smoked a joint and took annother 1mg. In retrospect, this is about the point where things were starting to get a bit out of control.

21:20 I proceeded to dance for a bit, still feeling very good, and smoked another joint.

22:20 After partying for a while, I really liked the headspace and body high, but it somehow lacked some psychedelia for my taste. I dunno what I thought but I proceeded to insufflate 10mg of 2C-C and took another 2mg Clonazepam.

23:20 An hour later I threw up from the 2C-C drip, I had minor hallucinations but the 2C-C wasn't all that great (duh, you took benzos you idiot) I somehow managed to take videos of me during this, I was dancing for half a minute then chilled out on the floor for a while then repeated this course of action endlessly.

1:50 No memory of what I did the past 2 hours, but my notes say I insuflatted another 10mg of 2C-C without additional effects. I guess a mix of dancing and chilling out. I smoke a joint and take another 2mg Clonazepam.

2:30 Somehow, and this is really the point that presents my abolute stupidity during this whole binge, I decide to insufflate 120mg of MDMA. This is also the point I might have accidently spilled about a gram of MDMA somewhere. I only recovered little pieces of it - sadface.jpg I fell asleep about 10 minutes later. No MDMA effects were noted at all and I didn't feel residual MDMA aftereffects the following days. I know 5-HT release is stopped during REM, and Clonazepam affects sleeping patterns, so maybe there's that.

**Day 2** - Friday - *6mg Clonazepam, 20mg 2C-C, more weed*

11:30 I think I woke up in some weird haze, and make some coffee. I took a 5-HTP and some Vitamins. 

12:20 I make the clever choice to take another 2mg Clonazepam. I also decided insuflatting another 20mg of 2C-C would help clear my mind right now and keep the party vibe going. I actually made a video of me doing this but I have no recollection of what happened after that.

16:20 No clue what happened here, I don't think the 2C-C did much however more Clonazepam seemed like a splendid idea. I smoked a joint and passed out half an hour later on the floor.

**Day 3** - Saturday - *6mg Clonazepam, a little spliff*

11:00 I woke up and made some Coffee. Physically I felt pretty ok, I took more Vitamins and 5-HTP. I might have have taken more Clonazepam, there are some missing pills in my bag that I didn't write down. Around 4mg maybe.

12:45 I still wanted to party, but I felt pretty sedated so I opted for another 180mg MDMA. Something was really wrong with me by this point. Again, I passed out 15 minutes later. Fortunetely I learnt the next day that I didn't actually take the MDMA because it was still there on my table. Good on me, I must have passed out before. By now time is irrelevant, the last 48h are a haze with no memories.

**Day 4** - Sunday - *6mg Clonazepam, another g of weed, glass of wine*

8:30 Woke up feeling really good, had some Coffee again. I cleaned the huge mess I made the days before, there was drugs and shit all over the place and I forgot where I put everything - but it was the first time I actually felt lucid again. I don't remember anything but small fragments from the last 3 days - I couldn't believe it was Sunday already. Benzos make time go so fast, it's almost scary. Took a shower, called my mum and had something to eat. Much love to the people in the /r/drugs irc, you guys are awesome <3 I have no idea what conversations I had during those days but I have very positive, albeit extremly foggy memories.

11:30 Yeah yeah.. another 2mg Clonazepam.

13:00 I smoke a joint. Seriously I should have ended it here. Normally I would drop a couple tabs of acid, smoke some weed on the comedown and be fine, but this is starting to escalate. 

15:00 Another 2mg Clonazepam

16:50 Another Joint, I was starting to enjoy this again. The combo is very chill and pleasurable.

18:00 Another 2mg Clonezpam, I'm starting to notice a pattern here. I smoke another joint and drink a small glass of wine. I pass out soon later feeling quite fuzzy and good.

**Day 5** - Monday - *3mg Clonazepam, a g of weed, a glass of wine*

10:00 I had to get up early because I had to go to work. I still felt pretty benzo'd but it was managable. It was more of a weed haze than benzo hangover. I don't think anybody noticed. My work performance sucked but I didn't give a shit.

14:00 I was stopped by a girl working for animal charity while in a subway station. I normally don't like talking to these people, but we had a really nice conversation, I missed 3 trains because of her, I think if I talked longer with her I would have invited her to dinner or something. I'm feeling quite loved up and open to people, which is on the unusual side for me and another thing why I enjoy the kpins so much. I went to buy more weed on the way home.

14:30 I got home from work, promplty decide to take another 2mg Clonazepam and smoke another Joint. I decide I should take it easy on the Kpins tonight, probably the first clever decision in 4 days.

18:00 I drink 2 cups of coffee to not pass out, decide to take another 1mg and say farewall to the Kpins for now.

20:00 Chilling out to some Late Night Alumni and Ishq, really nice. More weed was smoked.

0:00 More weed and I pass out.

**Day 6** - Tuesday - *3mg Clonazepam, 40mg 2C-C, no weed today but another glass of wine*

9:00 I woke up feeling quite hungover. I already missed a dentist appointment, but fuck the dentist anyway, my teeth are fine. It was suggested to not go cold turkey on the kpins, so I opted for 0.5mg, 2 cups of coffee, a bunch of vitamins, a snack, a 5-HTP and went off to work

15:00 I felt good the entire day, Work was a breeze, time passed so fast I couldn't believe it. I took another 0.5mg on my way home.

16:00 2 Cups of Coffee because why not? I don't even normally drink more than a cup a day, I'm seriously starting to think all these kpins are messing with me. I start sipping on a glass of wine.

18:00 I finish more work related stuff, which was greatly facilitated by the kpins. Again I could have ended it right here, and by the time of writing this, there were multiple occurences when this would have been the clever choice, but my judgement of what was right and wrong was so far off - I just didn't give a shit.

20:00 Alas, I look for more drugs, and I went with the 2C-C again. I know a lot of people kinda dislike 2C-C because it's very bland, but I really dig this drug as a whole package, duration and effects wise. The first 10mg burnt like a motherfucker, the 2nd 20mg were taken orally, and of course I haven't learnt from my first mistake and insuflatted another 10mg. All of this within an hour or two. I wish I had some weed today but I hadn't even planed on taking any more drugs when I woke up this morning. By now I was just looking to get high in whatever way possible.

23:00 Feeling quite good on the 2C-C despite previous tolerance and kpins. very chill and relaxing, enjoying this a lot. Some CEV, that weren't all that interesting. I have a strong feeling I need to end this binge. I didn't have work tomorrow so I stayed up until 2am. Gifted some BTC to a random dude on irc, took 2mg Clonazepam and went to sleep.",Addicted
"Doing MDMA for my first time, alone.
I posted to [/r/Drugs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ux179/im_doing_mdma_for_my_first_time_by_myself_tonight/) last night asking for advise on rolling by myself. Everyone told me not to, but I did it anyway. And this is what it is was like.

I'm 18, 157.5 lb, and took a capsule of 150mg of pure MDMA.

00:00 - It's 11:15pm and I just dosed. Looking forward to what's to come.

00:30 - 30 minutes in, staring to get a buzz. My computer chair was becoming increasingly more comfortable and I was starting to feel really content.

00:50 - Music is really starting to sound good. I remember trying to browse Reddit, but getting too distracted by the music (Crystal Castles, by the way). So far, I'm feeling great. 

01:00 - Took a shower. I felt like I could have stayed in there all night. It was amazing.

01:30 - It's been 90 minutes since I dosed and I think I'm starting to feel the full effects. I'm in a really good mood, I feel incredibly content, and I'm just enjoying everything. I gotta say though, around this point I started thinking, this is it? This is the highly acclaimed MDMA? Don't get me wrong, I was enjoying it; but I thought there would be more. At this point I just kinda felt like I took adderall or something like that. 

02:30 - Still just kind of sitting around my room. I was waiting for my mom to go to bed so I could go outside and smoke a bowl, and she was taking her sweet time. I've just been lying on my bed watching Netflix while playing guitar, still having a good time though.

03:15 - My mom finally went to sleep so I went outside. I smoked two bowls back to back and was feeling great. I went on a walk around the block and that's when the effects of the MDMA became a little more noticeable. I remember feeling up, but at the same time I was really relaxed. When I was walking, it kind of felt like I was floating or riding on a cloud [like this](http://images.wikia.com/dragonball/images/2/25/GokuFlyingNimbusDBEMS.png). When I got back, I smoked another bowl and went inside.

04:00 - Still feel like staying up but the weed has got me feeling more lazy. I decide to just watch ODDSAC, smoke another bowl, and watch Forest Gump until I pass out. 

05:00 - Finished watching ODDSAC, smoked another bowl, ate something, and crashed. I really liked how it easy it was falling to sleep as opposed to the 2c products I've done. 

Overall, I enjoyed it. Sure, it probably would've been better if I did it with some friends while being out and about, but it was still enjoyable by myself. I have to say though, it was a little underwhelming. I might of just had my expectations too high, but I definitely thought it was gonna be more extravagant than it turned out to be. I probably could have even driven if I had to (don't worry I don't ever plan on driving while on MDMA). 

This is totally something I want to do again. I love the stimulated but relaxed feeling it gives you. Next time I do it I plan on doing 200mg and going out and doing something with some friends. I'm glad I finally got to try MDMA. It may have been a little less than what I though it would be, but it was still fun. ",Addicted
"Meeting entity from past dmt trip while candyflipping
This is my first trip report so bare with me. 

BACKSTORY
A few weeks ago me and my friend ""A"" were smoking changa for the first time ever. So I take 3 pretty small hits from a homemade bong, I start to feel dizzy so I put down the bong, still filled with smoke. My friend told me to empty the bong but when i was about to I got really intense hallucinations and decided to lie down instead. 

DMT TRIP
When I closed my eyes I saw all these geometrical shapes moving in a certain way and felt the presence of atleast 2 counsiounesses. One felt like ""male"" and as he had an attitude of ""look at this fool who think he can try to comprehend our world"" and one ""female"" who didnt really make a strong impression but felt very nurturing. 

The male entity felt a bit hostile so I tried to remind myself that these trips are very short and I will soon be back to reality. BAM, as soon as I had that thought he stopped time, so I instead tried to accept everything that happened and it immediately got alot more fun. The female was playing with the geometrical shapes creating spirals and such. Soon the trip started to fade and I felt her putting me down in my human body sort of like you would a baby in a crib. 


CANDYFLIP - 200 ug lsd, ~0.16g mdma total

We(me and friend B and C) were canoing to an island. Had a wonderful and bonding experience! A while after the peak we decided to smoke weed and that's when none of us could keep the train of thought anymore, we were talking alot but constantly forgot about what. We brought a pretty large speaker with us and after a while i could see the music in the clouds. I can best describe it as big geometrical shapes in the same colour as the clouds moving in rythm with the music. Then it changed to the wierdest short cartoon snippets, alot of them were sucking each others dicks for reasons unknown to me. At one point I picked up a small stick/branch and when I looked at it a mix between a puppet show and a flip note comic started playing. Looked back to the sky and saw a ""portal"" of shapes, kind of those you see in animated dmt trips on Youtube. No more music in the sky, just this portal so I decide i wanna walk around and look at stuff just to see what happens. Walk around for a while and look at all the funny shit happening. Eventually everything turns to a portal so I decide to keep looking at it, even though it makes me dizzy. 

After looking at the portal for a while it turns into the geometrical shapes/patterns I recognize from my previous dmt trip. It moves around in the sky for a while and touches a tree and the whole tree lights up with these shapes/patterns in different colours. I approach the tree and when I touch it I immediately realise it's ""her"", the entity who was so kind to me during my dmt trip. I put my arm around the tree and lean on it. She misses me and want me to come visit her, I think... I stand there for a while but since the drugs are starting to ware off the logical part of my brain says ""hey! You're standing here hugging a tree, what are you doing?"" I decide to say goodbye and not to mention this to my friends so they dont think I've lost it(they took a little less than me and were not too far from sober at this point). 

So after this I decided Im gonna smoke more changa and attempt a breakthrough. But Im going to wait a few days/weeks to let my mind rest.  

Can anyone relate to any of this entity on lsd shit? ",Addicted
"The Best Day of my life
The best day of my life. 

10/28/17. Halloween Weekend. Toronto, Canada. Three people, myself included. LSD. 100ug. 

Wild. Electric. Surreal. 

I have all the words to describe the visuals that I saw, the sounds that I heard, the orgasmic sensations that I felt reverberate from limb to limb. But the experience is still so… beyond words. Adjectives do it no justice and even now, I struggle to find the relevant logical and semantic interconnections of written language to even begin to describe what I believe with a passion to be the best day of my life. 

It is nearly impossible to translate the psychedelic experience into biography. My storytelling capacity is nowhere near commensurate to the adventures we had, the emotions we felt, the insights we garnered, and the confounding yet simultaneously illuminating experience that a single tab of paper was able to precipitate in each of us. But yet, I remain incapable of ignoring the fact that what I experienced in that one night is in dire need of being shared, so I’ll compromise. Enter the 28th of October, 2017. 

* Buffalo, New York. It was the weekend after all my midterms and all my projects. I’ve been planning this day for weeks with my friends. The plan was to go to Toronto with two friends, D and J, and have each of us take one tab of acid when we arrived. We had a loosely-planned itinerary, mainly some places and locations we wanted to visit. But we wanted flexibility, knowing full well that ultimately, it was up to our visceral responses to dictate where we would eventually end up going anyways. I mean I’ve taken acid before. And I’ve tripped on shrooms with others. But tripping on acid with others? That was something completely new. And little did I know that one night was going to be a whole lot of “new”.

* 4:00 PM D was our driver. I sat shotgun. J was in the back. We were all huddled together in the center of the car on the drive to the hotel we booked in Toronto. We each took 1800mg of Phenibut an hour before we left to help attenuate the come-up anxiety and override any feelings of negativity that might take over during the trip. D was already down to trip – he’s done it with me before. But J never tripped before. He was interested in the idea of tripping but wasn’t fully certain. Yet. I had two hours to convince him that the experience would be completely worth it. I explained all the subjective effects on behavior, visuals, and headspace. I gave him scientific evidence regarding the safety potential of LSD as well as harm reduction techniques (set and setting, post-trip supplementation, proper hydration, etc). I gave him quotes spoken from great philosophers like Alan Watts to modern revolutionaries like Steve Jobs commending and advocating the LSD experience. And after much of my impressive persuasion techniques… he still wasn’t convinced.

* 6:00PM – Probably the only other reference time I can confidently share because things were about to get wild. We arrived at the hotel, unpacked, and got comfortable. None of our data plans were active except for D’s, the driver – he paid for roaming and was essentially our only source of navigation and control. I was the psychedelic mentor, the trip-sitter, but we still had to follow him – otherwise, we’d be completely lost without any way or connection to get back home. I took out a strip of 5 tabs on one of the beds. D and I looked at each other. We grinned – we knew exactly what was about to go down. We both popped a tab into our mouths, chewed, and then swallowed. I tried once more to convince J that it was worth it. The window of opportunity was running out. I had to convince him. If he took it too late, our trips wouldn’t be in sync meaning that we wouldn’t be able to connect and help each other through the duration of our trips. If he didn’t take it at all, the group dynamic would’ve been awkward and uncomfortable, sort of like when everyone in the room is high except for you and you feel alienated as a distant outgroup to everyone else. I did a bit more of those seductive persuasion techniques I was talking about. It worked. 5 minutes later, he took his tab. I put the other 2 tabs away. We were ready.

* We left the hotel, which was on the outskirts of the city, and started driving towards the center of Toronto… the Entertainment District. It was about an hour drive to our first destination: Sansotei Ramen. It had great Yelp reviews and I mean, who doesn’t love ramen? Exactly. We were already playing music over the speakers at the time. The Phenibut was maximizing and sensitizing our music appreciation. We were bumping to every song and definitely “felt” the individual aural details. “Save Dat One For Me” by The White Panda was the song where we really felt the acid start to “click” into place. You know that sensation you get when you try to swallow while tripping? That dry, insatiable, foreign throat sensation you get? We called it “cottonthroat”. It was the marker that signified the steady transition from our sober (Phenibut-infused) state into the psychedelic state. We stepped from one realm to another. Foreign, yet familiar. One plane to another. A smooth gradation, yet identifiably strange. And that was when we REALLY started feeling the music. Volumes maxed out. Windows pulled down. Icy gales rushing into the heated interior of the car from all sides but no, we didn’t care. We felt invincible. Arms waving in undulating gestures that harmonized perfectly with the oscillating frequencies of the playlist. I never felt such a profound connection to the EDM rave genre. Dancing was automatic – the music would rush into my body and externalize itself energetically in the form of tantric motions and head-nodding. Lights became brighter – each streetlight we sped past was surrounded with a rainbow-tinted halo aura. The external outlines of trees and structures were swelling and minimizing in the brisk wind. We yelled exuberantly. We couldn’t stop smiling. Nothing held us back. The visuals complemented the audio which complemented the vibrations running up and down our bodies from our head to our toes. Everything complemented each other. Nothing needed to be changed. Everything was perfect.

* Eventually, we arrived at the parking lot. We stumbled out of the car, still laughing and smiling. Walking seemed like such a foreign skill. Everything was hilarious. We knew how difficult it would be to act normal in a public setting but even still, we laughed at our plight. None of it mattered. We didn’t care about what others thought – this was OUR time. We walked up the steps from the parking lot and came out of the ground to 7 glaring letters, in colored sequence. Toronto. Immediately, we asked some strangers to take photos of us next to the letters. We felt like complete tourists but it was so perfect – our facial expressions, the lighting, the proportions…. It was our first memoir of the trip. 

* We started walking (or trying to walk) towards the ramen shop location and it was then that our headspace really started to change. It was inevitable that we began to think about the deeper dynamics of social structure and interactions. It was inevitable that we began to examine ourselves and develop insights about the way we acted and more so, why. We saw that the way we were walking was a lot more aggressive than the other people passing by. It was when things clicked – there were intricacies in the dynamic differences between Canadians and Americans, especially with us hailing from New York. Our walking stance and gait seemed unnecessarily belligerent – it was like we were going to war. It seemed to point towards the stereotype that Canadians were nice and New Yorkers… well, weren’t. A couple times we had to remind ourselves to slow down our walking and “adjust” to the ambience we were now in. Another subtle reminder that Canadians were much more relaxed and laid-back and New Yorkers tended to exude a much more hostile, self-centered, and combative presence commonly associated with and engendered from the heavily calloused and unsympathetic atmosphere of the city.

* We finally arrived at Sansotei Ramen. We were on line for several minutes before we were finally seated. All of us were deeply disconcerted with the vast options on the menu – there was so much that we wanted that we couldn’t formulate a decision. Eventually, we all decided on what we wanted to order. Somehow and oddly enough, we all ended up ordering the same thing – Tonkotsu Black. Coincidence or not, it was quite a phenomenon to behold – the sensation was akin to feeling like we were all connected in one way or another, in a tangible or cerebral context. Or both. While waiting for the food, we all spoke extremely loudly, decibels above our normal speaking volumes. What was interesting was that we weren’t actually speaking coherent sentences. It was fragments of deconstructed sentences or random verbs and adjectives strung together but somehow... just somehow, we all spoke that same language.

* Our psychedelia-infused language. We began to conjure up our own terms. 

* The “surface world” referred to all the sober people around us or people who have never tripped on psychedelics before – they were wholly incapable of comprehending the sensations we felt, the (incomprehensible) language we uttered, and the concepts we shared. But us three all understood each other. We were all on the same plane. 

* The concept of a “bubble”. Our group was akin to a bubble – we were all surrounded by an invisible semipermeable membrane. Our creative instincts and ideas would drift in between this bubble and combine and pervade the interior of the bubble. Everyone else had their own bubbles too. When we felt like we were being too loud or annoying to other bubbles to the point where it could be deemed “disruptive”, that’s when we knew we were projecting too much of our creative energy outwards and we needed to contain ourselves. At the same time, we needed to ensure that we didn’t completely contain and “silence” our own bubble – we didn’t want to repress all of our combined energy, spontaneity, and personality. We understood the necessity of establishing an equilibrium. And when two parties engaged in conversation, that’s when they would mutually allow their permeable membranes to fuse, albeit temporarily, for an exchange of ideas, opinions, and personal impressions. 

* An “encounter” was when denizens of the surface world would try to cross the sober-psychedelic plane to interact with us (or vice versa). Both parties would meet halfway, compromise, and try to communicate in a semi-intelligible hybrid language. It was difficult for both sides – the English dialect was disparate from the psychedelic dialect and our conceptions of ideas were dimensions apart. Our first encounter was with one stranger in the ramen shop. We found out he was a nighttime photographer, university instructor, and also had the connections to all the raving and clubbing events in Toronto. J and I had so much difficulty communicating with the waiter and the stranger that we resigned to simply looking at each other and quietly smiling. We knew what was up. We had to rely on D’s conversational skills to get us through that encounter as he was the most functional member out of all of us at that moment, and we did end up getting the stranger’s contact information. At the end of that encounter, we all commended each other for a job well done. Functioning while tripping was… something else. The meaning and structure of language seemed to fall apart. Social interactions were considerably more difficult. Concepts would break and restructure themselves within the recesses of our minds. It wasn’t until later into the night that we were able to more fully re-grasp our faculties. 

* We visited Graffiti Alley, an alleyway riddled with colorful spray-paint art. The colors all worked so well with each other and the elements of the graffiti all came to life. Afterwards, we decided to walk to Peace and Love, a marijuana dispensary that sold weed without a medical prescription. On the way there, we had our first encounter with drama. We felt two individuals following us. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw them looking at each other and pointing at us. They were definitely following us. After a couple blocks, I decided to pull us all over to the side and wait it out. They kept walking and eventually just passed us by. D, J, and I all discussed what just transpired when we ended up arriving at the dispensary afterwards. We weren’t being paranoid. The people following us most likely overheard our loud conversations about psychedelics and Canadian culture as opposed to American culture – they saw three vulnerable teenagers that could have easily been taken advantage of, robbed, beaten, or even worse. I kept replaying that episode in my head – I was terrified but I had to regain my senses.

* The dispensary was magical. They checked our IDs at the front to verify our ages and then motioned for us to enter a guarded entrance into a room filled with people and the aromas of well-cured bud. Never did I imagine myself visiting an underground dispensary to procure my own weed – it was always through friends, dealers, or other connections. My friend D was on the line ordering and when he realized he didn’t know what to order, confessed to the cashier that we were all tripping balls and needed a recommendation. The cashier chuckled and knew exactly what our headspace demanded – he gave us 2.6 grams of the award-winning Super Silver Haze. Our second encounter.

* It wasn’t until we left the shop that we realized we walked 40 minutes away from the parking spot. On the walk back to the parking lot, one store with vibrant candy colors and big couches and VR setups caught our eyes. We entered to find a VR arcade where groups could rent out their own areas to play VR games with each other. The experience was amazing. Being able to immerse myself into a visual reality environment while simultaneously tripping was an experience unlike any other – I felt like a kid again. It was pure entertainment. The instructor had to repeatedly teach us the controls – we were already struggling with functioning in true reality, so augmented reality was just adding a layer of difficulty. But even still, we had so much fun. Even the instructor had fun conversing and joking around with us. It was surreal. We decided to leave after an hour of play and walked all the way back to the car. 

* Afterwards, we did more driving and vibing. The music was too good. The audiovisual orgasms were constant and persistent. We drove to a supermarket to pick up an apple and then drove to Riverdale Park – it had a nice grass lawn with a view overlooking the city structures of Toronto. We sat down on a tree trunk, dug out the channels in the apple to make a bong, and smoked the Super Silver Haze that we bought earlier. It was amazing. Smooth and delectable. An organic high. With a view of the entire Toronto city and the LSD still coursing through our body, we all felt completely satisfied. Perfection.

* It was like we conquered the city. We laughed and imagined our experience to be similar to that of Christopher Columbus or any other conqueror. We literally left behind everything back in our hometown and embarked on a journey that was directed purely by our own instincts. No one to guide us. Just us and our imaginations. In our conquest of Toronto, we amassed jewels and gems. We were wealthy, but not by any material sense. We were armed with powerful insights, stories to tell, and an experience that would forever be ingrained into our minds. It was, quite honestly, the best day of all of our lives. 

* When we awoke the next day, we smiled to ourselves. We weren’t smiling because we were still high. We smiled because we remembered. And we would never not remember. It was like waking up from a really good dream. The difference is that we didn’t dream it. No, the difference is that we lived it.

"!!! DMT HOLY FUCKING SHIT BALLS DMT !!!
HOLY FUCKING SHIT BALLS!!!!!!! That is exactly what I said once I came back to my body from my DMT break through!

The day before took 2 hits of Acid I believe that is what helped me break through since the first time smoked I didn't accomplish. (did a lot of research!)

Had 3 friends in the room with me.

Took one hit laid down on my bed closed my eyes..................

Entered a dark black/gray tunnel then a door opens all kinds of fractals and mandala flower type shapes with bright lights all colors so bright hard to describe almost LED and glowing running through each pattern of symmetry. The most beautiful colors and shapes I have ever seen! Some points so vivid and bright to hard too look at.

Then I enter what felt like a room all green in color with vivid yellow running through it. Saw about 10-15 elves with their backs to me working very hard and fast on something I was unsure of.

Felt a sense of uneasiness when that happened the green/yellow wall came down in a sliding motion an entity/humanoid appeared before me looked like a black man but he was black and gray almost like an old black and white photo he had on sun glasses, he looked like a mixture of Will Smith and LeLar Burton Jr. (strange I am a small white girl) Was this my spirit guide?

When ""he"" appeared I heard music like none other almost a continuous ringing in a sense, but sounded very comforting. I felt warm, then what was next infinite love? My whole body felt an orgasmic feeling like none other. We were communicating not with words but with thoughts/minds and he was telling me everything is OK just enjoy being there and he enjoyed my presence and he was happy to be with me!

The wall came back up music stopped and the elves were working hard still I felt my head turn to the right then the left trying to see what they were working on. They were far away from me in the room. Then all moved to the left hand corner of the room.

Once again a sense of uneasiness came on, wall came down my entity/humanoid appeared he communicated with me asking how I was doing basically and I told him through my mind it was time for me to go I had my children and family to get back to. He let me know he understood. I thanked him several times for letting me join them and welcoming me with open arms. He told me anytime and he was going to let me go to back to my family and to embrace my time with them.

Door opens colorful mandala flower shapes with bright LED type lights occur, I feel as if I'm floating, then I feel myself start to wiggle my foot/feet fingers, I'm going back to my body. Open my eyes my boyfriend is standing in front of me he asks how I am. I'm laying there at this point I look at the ceiling and it is moving so many fractals and walls are moving as if i took 4 hits of acid...I sit up and say HOLY FUCKING SHIT BALLS that was the most amazing thing I've ever experienced, I'm still tripping hard as fuck I have to lay back down, lay down for about 5 more mins waiting for the room to calm down. Sit back up and then I am able to get up and walk and tell my boyfriend/friends about my experience.

I was out of body for about 12 mins they told me :-) I felt like I was out of body for half my life ♥

The Feeling of accomplishment of getting back to my body was awesome and I felt as if I were walking on a cloud!!!!!!!

 I kept saying Holy Fuck and doing WHOOs :-)

I asked my friends that were in the room with me if they did see me turn my head as I laid there and they did!

Everyone has their views as to where we go on DMT my boyfriend thinks we are in a simulation and we are the entities test subjects to learn how to love/hate while they are in other dimensions or planets.

I believe in God but dont label as a catholic/christian I have my own views as to what purgatory is and I believe it is just a place you go to before you go to heaven or hell......Thats where I believe I was, because your dont die on DMT but you are re birthed......

And I do agree with my boyfriend to an extent we just use different words we are Gods test subjects to learn how to love/hate.

So happy DMT found me it was so invigorating, enlightening, and spiritual and cant even put into words!

Should hang up the phone as they say but I might try it again one last time outside with nature.

"30x Salvia
This was the first time I had the chance to experiment with Salvia. At midnight, the day of my 17th birthday, I packed a .2 bowl, asked my friends to light my brains out and I inhaled. I was in a garage, sitting in one incomfortable beach chairs (THEY ARE THE DEVIL). I start coughing my hit so I exhale, I feel half of my face being pushed in, I thought that was a shitty substance. That's when my back melted through the chair, becoming one with the wall behind me. I knew something was wrong but becoming a wall was the least of my priorities. My upper body was leaning on the left side, putting alot of pressure on my ribcage. It took all my concentration to move out of that metal bar, only to fall on the other one. My *VeRy HiGh* sitter just realized what tortured me and put me in a correct stance. It was hard to look at him and thank him for two reasons. 1 : I couldn't talk for shit. 2 : His face was detached from his body (that I couldn't see) and drifted through the 4rth dimension (I saw him as a *serpentlike* trail) All of my friends around me looked like weird-ass serpents, the garage faded and I could see the universe, I saw stars and geometrical, colored shapes all behaving like ondulating waves, not necessarily in a patern but all around my field of view. Throughout the trip I did nothing but say this *chronological order* : I don't feel it. Wooooooowwww Fuuuuck. Babbled a few incoherent onomatopeias and laughed for 4 minutes, I enjoyed it.",Addicted
"DMT - My First ""real"" experience
Hello, let me start off by saying I have had extensive amounts of psychoactive substances and I would like to caution people to first explore substances like LSD, Mushrooms, Mescaline, ect. before they embark on the substance that is DMT(N,N-Dimethyltryptamine). 

This experience was so amazingly powerful, and was life changing in every way possible. 

Before I went for a high dose experience I wanted to see how my body and mind reacted to this substance. I took a couple hits through a vaporizer and here is what I experienced. 

1 Hit: An instant wave of euphoria all thoughout my body 

2 Hits: Everything is in a geometric pattern, mostly diamonds and pulsing

3 Hits: Everything crashes to the floor and almost melts away and I close my eyes to see the most beautiful colors and patterns. Indescribable. 

___________________________________________________________________________

Now for the ""real"" experience. 

Set/Setting
  At around 1:00 AM I went outside and sat down on a chair with a pillow behind my head. The temperature was around 60 degrees(my favorite temp.) the sky was beautiful I had an early day at work. Everything was just going good. I had this lure to do DMT again, like something was calling my soul. 

Trip
1:30 PM - I remember this time in specific because I had my phone and I wanted to meditate to get rid of my ""pre-flight jitters"" by this time my heart was pounding but my breathing was at a good rate. 

Around 1:40 PM - I proceed to set up my vaporizer and take my first hit... here is what follows: 

1st Hit: My nervousness melts away, I get an instant feeling of euphoria like the first time 

2nd Hit: This one is where everything really changed... my surroundings became completely unrecognizable. Everything looked like as if I took LSD x 1,000,000

3rd Hit: Visuals become extensively more intense but I have to ask myself ""Do I need more?"" I remembered reading that if you need to ask yourself that... then you need more. 

4th Hit: This, this was the breaking point for me. I took the biggest possible hit I could and held it in until I was forced to cough. The exhale after this was so revealing in a weird way. Everything starts to look alien to me. I hear a very distinct ""buzzing"" sound... this slowly melts into a absolute silence; it is so blissful. 

The world starts rushing at me, I am forced to close my eyes. The first thing I encounter is a door, but not like a door here; it was in the shape of a triangle. A ""thing"" opens the door and waves me to come in... for whatever reason I feel threatened by this and I try to run the other direction. 

This is the part that really made everything make sense to me: 

A snake, I vividly remember what this snake looked like. It was made of square/geometric patterns and it was a FULL rainbow of colors; by this I mean colors that do not exist in this place(""earth""). It wrapped itself around me and pulled me into a room that was all black with geometric patterns as the floor and as the walls. I remember this is no light source but everything glows to provide reference to where it is. The snake bites me; but instead of it hurting it feels(for lack of a better word) ""Orgasmic"" and I can see it is sucking a blue-ish fluid out of me into its body. It gives me a menacing look and rips a hole in this room and reveals earth to me. It seems like it wants me to ask something... before I even ask a question is almost laughs at me and tells me(without speaking) ""That place is all fake, simply an experiment maybe what you would call there a simulation"" It proceeds to laugh tell me ""That's the truth, what will you make of it?"" It proceeds to release me from it's grasp and I fall through the floor I try to grasp onto the nothingness of this place but it isn't possible. 

I wake up with almost a startled reaction as I felt like I was falling. I felt like everything was not real. 

For the past few days up until now, I have the lingering feeling like everything is staged. This world I am viewing doesn't seem real to me anymore... Not in a bad way but also not in a positive way.

I honestly see the world differently and it disgusts me; the way our society is running is not real. This is all fake and we have been programmed to be ""fake."" 

I see High potential with this substance but warn anyone to try it. You might not like what is behind the veil. ",Addicted

TRIP REPORT

Upon waking up I cooked an egg and had it for breakfast. Without hesitation, I had decided to smoke a large dose of Changa after finish my egg. Previously, my Changa experiments had all been fairly low dosed or I had only had the determination to smoke half of the bowl. But this time was definitely going to be different.

I filled my bowl with Changa and went outside to bask in a chair placed directly under the burning sun. I felt very comfortable, but had no expectation of what I was going to be welcomed by on the journey. Overall, a very mellow and relaxed state of mind.
I also listened to the album by Shpongle – Museum of Consciousness while I was having the experience. It really helped me distance myself from my surroundings and focus more on the experience itself. In all my previous Changa/DMT experiences, I've always been distracted by people talking, TV or unfitting music.

I was taking the first hit off of the bong but after inhaling a fair amount I found myself on the brink of coughing, so I cleared the bong from smoke and held in the smoke for as long as I could. Upon exhalation I instantly recognized the characteristic effects of the Changa. I went into a very relaxed daze and quickly pulled myself together to smoke the remaining of the bowl.

After exhaling the second and last hit, my friend helped me but the bong down on the ground and I was out of this reality in a matter of seconds. I almost forgot to exhale the second hit, as I was instantly mesmerized by the instantaneously appearing fractal visuals and unbelievably quick onset.
Unlike all my previous experiences with Changa/DMT, this experience was EXTREMELY fast paced and not as relaxed as they usually are. I felt like I was being bombarded with information at a speed that my brain simply couldn't keep up with. It was the most intense feeling I've ever had. I also noticed that the time completely vanished quickly after having exhaled all the remaining smoke. The lack of time brought me into the moment of now unlike any other psychedelic experience has been able to. There simply didn't exist anything outside of what I was experiencing.
Touching on the subject of time, I can say with assurance that the trip itself lasted 12 minutes, by looking at the duration of which the Shpongle album had been playing. However, from my perspective after coming down, it felt like I was away for 40-60 minutes.

Returning to the experience itself; Just moment after being bombarded by information through the visual and audio input that I was receiving, I entered an infinitely large place. None of the walls surrounding the room/place were visible to me, seeing as they were so far away. At the same time, I also started seeing entities with human-like limbs dance forth from the background. They were dancing all the way up into my face and then faded back into wherever they came from. I couldn't really count how many there were, but I’d say there was at least a dozen entities dancing around me. It was as if the music I was listening to was being controlled by these entities and that everything they did was in some way synchronized to what I was hearing.
After just a few seconds of this going on, the entities started creating things right in front of me, using the dance and music that they themselves seemed to be creating. The things themselves danced around just as much as the entities and were transforming to new objects very very rapidly. They were of a very fractalish structure. The entities seemed to sort of hide behind the objects, or maybe they were just shoving them up into my face so that I could see them clearly. Although the objects were crystal clear like nothing I've ever seen, the entities seemed to be quite a bit harder to get a grasp on.

I could tell that they had definite human characteristics in the form of arms and legs, but they were entirely made up of the most vividly colourful and changing lights my eyes have ever witnessed. So I could definitely sense the outline of these entities, but could in no way actually get a good look at their other characteristics, due to their transforming nature.

At some point during the trip, the music in my ears vanished completely and I could only hear the sound of the entities and the room around me. I'm having a very difficult time remembering the sounds I heard however, but I felt very relaxed during this time, as I was no longer being bombarded by the information contained within the song. Moments late the music returned, but my visual experience remained fairly constant.

I slowly regained some of my bodily presence and noticed that my breathing was very deep and relaxed. It felt like the most profound meditation session I've ever had. I also found myself to by lying in the grass, covered in sweat and rolling around in my own saliva. I really didn't care though, I felt absolutely perfect in the moment. The experience itself was just as powerful and personal as just a minutes prior to this, but I felt much more relaxed and at home, which slowed everything down by a notch.

At this point I also entered a yawning phase which even outlasted the trip by 2 hours or so. I was yawning several times a minute and each time I exhaled, I also let out a very deep and relaxed sigh. What really astonished me was that I realized when this happened, that I could transform the objects, which the entities had brought forth, by myself. It was beyond amazing to witness my voice synchronizing to every movement that was taking place behind my closed eyelids.

After lying in the grass for a few minutes waiting for the trip to subside I unplugged my earbuds and I noticed that my mouth was full of grass. I was very disorientated and was to my own surprise, lying a fair distance away from the chair where the experience had begun. My closed eye visuals also slowly subsided and the entities returned to the background scene where they came from.
When I opened my eyes, I was blown by the fractal structure of all the trees, plants and grass around me. Everything was also fairly bright.

What I wondered a lot about after the experience was the fact that the entities seemed to already be around me from the beginning of the experience. In other words, it felt as if they coexisted with everything in another dimension which became visible to me through the ingestion of DMT. So, they never really ”appeared” to me in that sense, they were always with me.

After the 12 minute experience was over, I had the most WONDERFUL after effects. I have never felt so relaxed in my entire life and was literally in a meditative experience for up to 2 hours afterwards. My breathing was very deep and I yawned countless times, while being very content and happy about what I had just gone through and witnessed. My ”hunger for DMT” had definitely been satisfied and I had finally been shown the sheer intensity and power contained within this chemical.
After all my low dose experiences, I was beginning to think that DMT wasn't really as powerful as people made it out to be on the internet, as it seemed like something you could do several times a day and just have a good time. This experience however truly established a deep respect for DMT and I no longer feel the constant need to search for when I can have my next trip.

All in all, this was the most BEAUTIFUL and INTENSE psychedelic experience I have ever gone through. I am definitely in love with DMT.",Addicted
"2.5 tabs Ecstasy
Last year I started experimenting with MDMA, this was my fourth time taking it, I took 2 and a half tabs of my 3 total. My memory of the night is was shattered into many pieces so I cannot do a proper T + Xmin report but the trip fades in comparison to the comedown. Here it goes.

I had to walk a mile because I had helped a friend get home and took his bus instead of mine, it did not matter to me, I plugged my headphones into my ipod and started walking, grinning at first. Soon after leaving my friend, about an eighth of the mile, I started realizing there was something wrong with my field of view, as I walked forward, things-people would dissapear. I saw families around their car, packing their things in complete silence. I stopped briefly to see if they would stop. Seeing them move, I start walking towards them when they dissapeared suddenly. I looked around and it was like I was in one of those games with Fog of War around you at a certain radius, except that the fog in this case were humanoid shaped hallucinations. I was absolutely fascinated by them but the MDMA in me wanted me to walk. I walked almost the whole thing, never encountering any sign of real life. Near my house, in a parking lot I looked up in the sky, there was an orb of light (it's a parking light) that was really shiny and pure white, I was looking at it and I could see it pulse with energy, it talked to me. I telepathically had a deep conversation with a street light. I didn't realize at the time it was a street light and I talked to it for about 30 minutes before snapping out of it. I looked at the windows of the house right in front of the orb of light to see if any1 saw me, I looked around and there was nobody, I took out my ipod and just couldn't believe how the fuck time just fastfowarded 30 minutes... Went to bed after a whole evening of walking, to get warmed up by diamond shitting sunshine riding unicorns in my bed (this I made up but the rest is true... my bed was just REALLY comfortable)",Addicted
"Ego Death on an eighth of shrooms and a hit of shatter at the peak.
Another redditor asked me yesterday if I could explain ego death and I decided the nearly 6000 characters I wrote finally deserved it's own post.
***
When I had my ego death, I didn't even know what it meant until it happened. I was on shrooms. I'd only been doing them a little while and I still wasn't sure what I was looking for. I'm in my mid-thirties and had never taken a psychedelic (that I remember, I now question whether I might have done them years ago and blocked the experience). I wanted to hallucinate above all. I'd been taking smaller doses because I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. I had no idea what the onset would be like, if I would vomit, if I would go crazy, etc.

Finally I got brave and my best friend and I decided to do them together. I brought over my home grown shrooms and I took a little over an eighth. (In my research I had found that the fact that I was taking a rather large dose of Cymbalta greatly diminishes the effects of shrooms.) He took about 2g dry. After about an hour, we felt good and had light OEVs. He was definitely seeing more than I was. I was seeing a shimmer and depth to things, but no talking cat, no twisting or bending of reality.
To understand the setting I have to explain that my buddy is my drug buddy, but also my best friend. He has cerebral palsy and is a paraplegic. He has been in a wheelchair since about 3-4 years old and we have known each other since we were both 18 or 19 years old. We have seen each others girlfriends come and go over the years and we've smoked a LOT of pot together. We both work in the computer field and learn and problem solve together.

Right after we'd eaten the shrooms he asked if I wanted to vape some Shatter. I said no, we'd better wait and see how strongly this affected us. So the first hour was okay, and we hit the peak at 90 minutes. He was feeling really good as a lot of his pain dissipated, but we hit 2 hours and weren't ""tripping balls"" yet. Two to 2.5 hours is usually where I peak, but since nothing special was happening I said to him ""Let's vape that weed now."" I took the first hit, a big one. I think I let out a little cough (it's vapor, after all) and as I exhaled I started to feel it. I handed him the vaporizer as it quickly took hold and said ""I'll see you later, buddy.""

The OEVs were getting intense. Everything got quite a bit more vibrant. I sat in his wife's glider-rocker and the cat jumped on my lap. My body was vibrating (not shaking). Suddenly, any and all pain I had was gone. I started petting the cat and saw that he had a gold aura surrounding his entire body. When I pet him, my hand could feel the aura. It was warm and pulled at the atoms of my hand. I noticed when I blinked that my view didn't change. I closed my eyes and saw the most beautiful thing. I was a hypercube and it was turning inside out. But unlike looking at a 3d computer model of a 4d concept, this made complete sense.

I glanced over at my best friend, who was now staring at the ceiling, jaw agape. I asked how he was feeling. He said ""I don't feel any pain for the first time I can remember."" He was crying, but smiling. When he spoke, I could feel his emotions as my own. Then I said to him ""Suddenly I understand Event Horizon. I don't need eyes where I'm going."" I closed my eyes and it felt as if my shoulders and hips didn't exist. I could feel my hands and legs, but they were detached. They felt as if they were floating away. Then they were gone. I was only my head and my mind.
All these experiences kept washing over me. I could go backward in time and recall all my personal experiences with perfect clarity. Each time I stopped on a memory, it was as I was reliving it. It was seeing memory as it was formed.

Now this is where it gets really difficult to explain. I saw gold and red and all the patterns were vertical. (Like [this](http://alexgrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Alex_Grey_BardoBeing.jpg) with red instead of blue and no skulls and more vivid.) I was at the center of all these patterns. My ""view"" widened past what the human viewing angle of approximately 95 degrees. I could ""see"" 360 degrees. But at this point it wasn't ""I"" anymore. Well, I was, but ""I"" was everything, everyone who ever existed. I had no sense of ""self."" I could no longer feel any of my body even when I think I opened my eyes. I was no longer human. I distinctly remember that realization. I just was.

The love I felt was like nothing else I've ever experienced. Most people understand being in love with someone, but you can't feel other people loving you. When I had ego death, I felt all the love in the universe accepting me. In fact, as the intensity build on the come-up, I kept repeating ""love and acceptance"" to myself to calm my anxieties. This is the best I can explain it. Ego death is where you cease to exist as an individual, as a human being. You received verification that exactly as Bill Hicks said, ""that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.""

I've never really been afraid of death. I recognized my own mortality at a young age. But now I look forward to death, knowing what is there, what has also been verified by a very recent DMT breakthrough. I'm not looking for death, but I will welcome it when it comes. No pain, no suffering, no bullshit. Only love and light and peace.
***
I hope that helps the rest of you along with the redditor that requested it. It's very important to remember that this is my subjective experience and that mindset and setting going into a trip can produce a very different ego death experience. Some people have the same loss of self but during a frightening experience. I believe though, as many do, that there is no such thing as a bad trip if your purpose for the trip is to find answers. There may be frightening or negative things presented to you, but there are always insights to be found in any introspective trip.",Addicted
"Impromptu DMT Trip [DMT]
**Some background info:** I was back at my parent's home for winter break, and one of my friends from high school invited me over to his house, I'll call him B. I drove over and he was there with another friend of ours, who I'll call C. B and C were smoking weed and offered me some, but I've got a drug test coming up so I declined. We talked for a while, and then we decided to go play some video games. After a few minutes, B asks me if I would like to smoke some DMT since he has a little bit. I'd been wanting to try DMT for a few months now, but I wasn't sure if I was in the right frame of mind to do it at this moment. I decided that I might not find any DMT for a long time, so I told B that I wanted to do it. 

We moved to a room with a bed for me to lie down on so that I'd be comfortable during the trip. B and C start loading the DMT into a vaporizer and I go to get a drink of water because I was pretty nervous at this point and I was shaking a little bit. I ask B if he has any advice and he tells me to take a few deep breaths to calm my body. B asks if I want any music playing, but nothing comes to mind. I'm still shaking pretty badly from the nerves, but I grab the whip and start inhaling.

**The Trip:** I inhale for about 30 seconds and don't really feel anything. I think the temperature on the vape was off or maybe there wasn't that much DMT, but I'm not feeling the effects I had read about. I try taking another hit. I look around the room and see fractals overlaying everything I look at. I get a rush through my body and the shaking disappears. My mind is in a tripping state now, and I start doubting whether I can handle the trip, but only for a fraction of a second. Immediately after I become very calm and a great happiness overtakes me. I look around a bit more at my hands and everything in the room, then I take one more hit, and I hold in for as long as I can. I start feeling very disconnected from my body, and start to think how much longer I should hold in my breath. When I finally exhale after about 20 seconds, the sound of my breath leaving my body sounds very animalistic and I'm reminded that humans are in fact animals and not a different class of being as we often perceive ourselves. I look at the carpet and it is separated into hexagons like a honeycomb, and a small column of carpet is poking out from the middle of each. There's no more DMT in the vape, and I didn't manage to break through like I hoped, but I am completely content with what I'm experiencing. I tell B to put on some Bach, and I lie down on the bed. 

I close my eyes but the light above me is too bright, so I ask B to turn the light off. B turns the light off and starts playing Bach's Violin Concerto in A Minor. I start feeling as though I'm moving forward through darkness, but when I look closer there are pulsating fractals in my entire field of vision. They aren't very obvious but once I notice them they are impossible to miss. In my mind, I start moving forward to the flow of the music, zooming in from fractal to fractal. As the music continues, I become more and more elated with the pure beauty of it. I hear a note in the concerto that I hadn't paid attention to before, and I let out one exclamation from surprise. I hear myself, and that single sound re-affirms my love of myself and my assurance that I am living my life in the way that makes me happiest. The laugh resonates *me*. I start to notice something to my left sliding in and out of the fractals as I move forward, and after looking closer I notice that it's a cat of some sort. It has neon colors for a face that keep changing back and forth, and it moves through the fractals at the tempo of the music. There's another cat to my right and they are both moving with me while we bathe our minds in the perfection that is Bach. The cats look at me every once in a while but otherwise they don't interact with me. 

The first movement ends, and I stop moving forward. I wait for the second movement to start, but B had used Youtube to find the first movement. I try to tell B to put on the next movement, but he start the 3rd movement of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto instead. While I do love Mendelssohn, I don't have as much of an emotional connection with his music as I do to Bach's. When the music starts I start moving forward again and the fractals start to alternate faster to the faster tempo. I can feel the effects of the DMT fading as the piece progresses, but not before seeing hundreds of lizards sliding past each other. I think that Bach's music must be feline in nature and Mendelssohn's is lacertine. As the effects fade more and more my first thought is that I want more. I also wonder whether I should lay down in bed for longer because B really wanted me to have a break through trip. As all the fractals start to fade away, I realize that the experience I had was wonderful and that I didn't want any more DMT, and that pretending to be tripping would be silly and unnecessary. 

**After the trip:** I sat up and B asked me how my trip was. I start by telling him that he knows how hard it is to describe a DMT trip (I've barely done the whole experience justice here). Then I tell him that it wasn't a breakthrough trip, and he says 'oh' in a disappointed way. Right away I say, not 'oh' in a disappointed way, but 'OOOHHH' in an amazed way. I tell him about my trip as best I can, and I give him a hug and thank him for the experience. I felt very refreshed after the trip and my mind was extremely clear. 

The experience made me re-visit my thoughts about god. I most certainly don't believe in a god like most religions pray too. I think that if there is a god, it isn't some sentient being that can think or help an individual. If there is a god, it's some force that is the driving force of the universe. I'm still not able to phrase my feelings on this subject well, but I'll keep exploring and hopefully I'll be able to before my life is over. ",Addicted
"An interesting weed exp (blunt)
Extra info: I smoke small bowls daily and the occasional 1/2 blunt when I’m out hiking or biking. Enjoy 

The story:
I’m smoking in a one room cabin next to the woods. I roll up a blunt of some weed. I’ve been smoking this weed for the last few weeks. I decide to light it and take a walk through the woods. 

I begin the walk with a focus on being present and aware of the nature around me. Running my hands through the leaves and really observing the world around me. All the while I’m taking moderate pills from the blunt about every min or so. 

I come to an open area and decide to sit and watch the woods. Just to see what is going on around me. I spot a small spider on my leg, harmless. The spider continued across my leg to the edge and they shot its web to a blade of grass, and walked across. 

I was amazed by this spider. The wind was actually pretty fast I’m spider terms, but this small creature aimed and timed its shots perfectly. It continued on and I slowly followed it. It was during my focus on the spider that a thought appeared. 

Humanity is intelligent self-aware beings of a level not experienced elsewhere in nature. 

Humanity and their ability to think in such complex and unique ways has giving us a huge step up in this world. The gravity of that really hit me. Without the existence of life outside our Earth proven, then we are it.

We are the culmination of millennia of events. The intelligence and ability of humanity is staggering, and come with a burden. A burden to protect those that haven’t achieved. 

It was a profound realization. I wouldn’t call myself an environmentalist, but the more I’m in nature the more I want to preserve it. There’s a serenity about being around so much life and being able to idly sit by and watch it. 

Below the TL;DR is what I wrote immediately after the moment. 

TL;DR Had an amazing nature walk and recognized the significance of human intelligence and how it stands apart from other known life. 

“
Our existence in this universe as self-aware life, humanity is a miracle of creation. Acceptance of developing life and encountering other life is also available, however until they are discovered I retain my initial statement. Our existence in this universe as self-aware life, humanity is a miracle of creation. 


Our miracle does not devalue other creations, instead it gives upon us the responsibility to protect and nurture them. If we don’t, without other self-aware life to exist we will be taking a HUGE step backward in evolution. 
“

I traded the word self-aware for intelligence in my post since I felt self-aware is recognized in some animals. Not quite sure. Also smoked a whole blunt alone in like 15-20min, It was burning really quick. Did not mean to smoke that much 😅

"Lemon tech 🍋
Before I begin; I think it’s important to say I’ve taken mushrooms and acid many times and always have had good intense experiences. But this experience was the most intense of all my trips to date, and the most beautiful.

I had this experience today. I decided to try the lemon tech, so I took around 2.5 grams of mushrooms, ground them up and put them into some lemon juice. I let the mushrooms sit in the lemon juice for about an hour and then slammed it, and chased it with some water. I hadn’t eaten anything so my stomach was empty. 

The high came on in about ten minutes and immediately I started to see fractals and feel my energy lift. I decided I was going to meditate so I sat and listened to some meditation music, and that intensified everything. The fractals became full geometric patterns that danced in every color you can imagine and some you can’t. I had energy vibrating throughout my entire body, and at one point the vibrations got so intense, i felt it completely lift me out of my body. Before I knew it, I was in another dimension, face to face with this beautiful celestial being. 

She was a tall, green being, with beautiful features. She had this fleshy hair that was done into two braids that hung down to her waist, beautiful bright eyes that seemed like they had galaxies inside of them, and she spoke in sounds. Pleasant tones and nodes played when she opened her mouth and somehow I could understand her perfectly. I asked her what her name was, and she got giggly and shy, but she told me. She took my in her arms and hugged me, as she whispered secrets in my ear. She told me the universe is one giant embryo and the earth was at the center of this embryo and everything is one gigantic being and we are part of it. We come from the earth and because of this we have a sacred bond with it, and that the earth will help us attain our new level of consciousness if we listen. She also said we have lost touch with how to communicate with the earth and we need to remember how.

Then another being walked in, this one a man, or a masculine version of their species. He was a tall being with blue skin, a long wirey beard that was made into a perfect point, and he had this stern look on his face, almost angered, and I just looked at him and smiled  and his expression changed to a very soft, loving energy. They told me that they are the “mother and father” of this universe and that I am one of their children, and as one of their children I need to learn their ways. Learn how to get in touch with myself, light my chakras and reach nirvana. Then and only then, will I be mature and capable enough to live in this dimension with them. I sat with them for a while, asked them questions and we laughed and cried together. This part of the trip was really special because it seemed like I had some kind of connection with these beings. 

After the conversation they hugged me again and told me that I had to leave until I was ready. They then introduced me to another being.

This is where it gets a little more strange. They said that the being they introduced me to was a “spiritual teacher”. This teacher was one of the more frightening looking beings, but had a beautiful energy around it. This teacher took me to a desolate galaxy, with no other beings, and showed me a “band of the universe”. This “band” looked like millions of light years worth of strands of dna. The teacher then began to manipulate the energy and create a planet. The planet had rings, like Saturn, but still looked like the strands of dna. We walked on these rings, and then sat and meditated. This teacher taught me how to “learn my light” and how to light my chakras. We sat there for years meditating, before the teacher finally told me that our time was coming to a close, and to practice and never forget what I have learned. I told it that I would never forget, embraced it and floated back into my body. 

I’m still trying to make sense of it all but I feel like a lot of questions have been answered. All in all; my trip was life changing. I learned so many things, and I also learned that for myself personally, I can get higher with the naturals in our world than with man made drugs like acid, and I enjoy it more. 

This is definitely a turning point in my psychedelic journey. If you made it this far, thank you for reading.",Addicted
"LSD, new years in a casino
Ok, so I had been holding onto a tab of some strong lsd for about a month now waiting for the perfect time to dose. I used to dose all the time about twice a week but it became less special because I did that. I feel its something you need to treat with respect and save for special occasions. Anyway I dosed and 30 minutes later I felt an inner calling telling me to go to the local casino. This is where it really starts to hit me. T 30 minutes in the trip. I walk through the doors and I feel the machines calling. I walk up stairs and I feel a machine calling me, it was crazy.... I sit down at the machine and on the second spin I win 300 dollars.... I put in a 20.... I cash out after a few bunk spins and go down stairs and get a double of some good whisky. I gave her a 20 dollar tip as I always do. Because I feel spreading positivity is the best feeling you can ever get. I don't remember what kind it was, I was starting to feel trippy so I asked the bar tender to hook me up with her recommendation. I finish my drink and go back upstairs. At this point I feel as if I am communicating with the machines. I pick another one.... I put in another 20 and put my hands on the machine. My friend said I looked like a retarded wizard casting spells. Any way the money keeps racking up, I hit 190 and after a few bunk spins I cash out at 140. It was so weird contemplating what just happened to me. Winning all that money, tripping. I felt as though I had a connection with the machines and they liked me. Anyways, I leave in almost disbelief. When stuff like this happens on LSD its fells so much more intense than it would if you were in you're natural mind state. Anyways a very interesting time. What a way to start the New Years? How was everyone else's New Years? Anyone else ever felt a communication between a machine or animal on LSD? I do all the time with animals, first time I felt I had a communication with a machine. Feed back appreciated.

"trip report first time LSD
Hey all i took LSD for the first time yesterday and this is how it went down.
7:30AM-ate my sugar cube on an empty stomach and played battlefield 2 and Arcade Fire's funeral album waiting for the come up.
7:45-7:50ish- i noticed something was different but couldnt figure it out. colors were a bit enhanced and felt a bit nauseous.

around 8:15- the game was getting harder to play and the music was becoming incredible.
8:30ish- i played with my dog outside and had tracers. when i threw the tennis ball, i saw a trail of neon yellow through the air. my back yard had a bunch of colorful roses and flowers and was amazing. also the sky was like a blue and violet mix.

i lost track of time here, but remember what happened. things started to pick up pretty quickly. the cement in the brick walls started to flow in the bricks and everything looked super 3d. walls were breathing inside. i laid down on the ground and my dog came up and licked my face and i started cracking up. his face was hilarious. my friend and i always joke about how he kinda looks human, well on acid, he looks human x10. i watched his curly tail get curlier.

i kept getting into thought loops and everything seemed to happen frame by frame. thankfully, i wrote, ""youre okay :)"" on my hand and it helped me a ton. as i looked at it though, the ink would stretch on my hand and my fingers looked crazy.

I then walk down my street to my friends house because i was taking care of his dogs for the weekend. The walk down was magnificent. i watched people's driveways flow and form waves like at the end of the acid scene in that woodstock movie. flowers seemed to explode and i couldnt stop smiling.

once i get in his house, he had a trippy ass table cloth. i watched the patterns raise off of it then go back on to it. i zoned out into it and forgot what i was thinking about. then my trip sitter knocked on the door and freaked me out. this is where things got even more amped up.

He was going to smoke weed and i really missed when i was able to but cant due to drug testing. so i was clean for 2.5 months. i realized i had a four day weekend and could most likely get clean by the end of it so i said why not.

I take a 1 mid sized rip, and thats all i needed. I held it in, looked up in the sky and it just exploded and was amazing. the clouds seemed to get lower and lower until the point where i sank into my chair to not be taken into it. when i exhaled, everything melting together. it was mind blowing. his house melted into the trees and had the branches curl into it.

i wanted to go inside but stay outside, so i sat in the middle of the doorway. that was so crazy. if you havent done it, i recommend it. you can feel the different atmospheres. the inside and outside felt like they were pushing together. the inside seemed peaceful and introspective while the outside was lively and adventurous. we went inside for a while.

from here, im positive im at my peak. everything seemed really candylike. his outside brim of hiis closet looked like the airhead xtreme candy strips flowing around. all his furniture was bright and looked kinda like carmel, but melted into the ceiling. i saw patterns on the ceiling. i cannot describe those.

i went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. that was incredible and is where i learned about alot about myself. you can take 2 paths going in there. the happy path, where you learn the positives about yourself, and the bad path, where you learn flaws about yourself. i took both at different times and found lessons that i wanna keep private. also watching your face morph and change was sick. we watched a bunch of cartoons like danny phantom, adventure time, sesame street etc and that all seems to be made for acid. it was perfect.
i went home around 2pm and put my music on shuffle while i watched tv. i didnt know how to change the channel and that show general hospital was on. the lyrics in the music fit perfect with the mouths moving and was hilarious.

after that, i was coming down and played xbox. i still felt energized and colors were still vibrant but no more flowing patterns melting visuals.

i still have the color enhancement which i think is sick and 10 out of 10 would do again.

"My first mushroom trip (7G)
This is my first trip report so any advice would be greatly appreciated for future trip reports. This is not a recent trip report as I have had atleast 80+ trips since then. This was a very challenging experience. I was 21 at the time.

It's March break of 2016 and I want to try my first psychedelic experience, a week before this I tried 2 grams of cubes but I only got the giggles with no visuals or sensations in my body so I thought I needed more the next time. (I was ignorant, didn't research and I deserved what I got). I go out of town to pick up an ounce of shrooms and i didnt know what type of magic mushroom I had purchased, which I now know were blue meanies. 

After a 3 hour drive I head home, I was staying with my sister and her boyfriend at the time because my girlfriend had kicked me out of the house. My mindset was to trip out and take my mind off of my breakup and my son who I now wasn't allowed to see until I went to court. I was such an IDIOT, how could I not do research beforehand, I had no respect for psychedelics back then.

I walked into the door and asked my sister and her boyfriend if they wanted to do shrooms, they said no. I sat on the couch and pulled out my scale, and weighed out 7 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms. I grabbed them all and just chewed them up in my mouth until it was gunk and swallowed, took about 10 minutes just to get it all down. It's about 2 pm in the afternoon.

T 0:00 - finally they are all down the hatch, I'm sitting on the couch talking to my sister and her boyfriend about doing mushrooms and they are gaining interest. We have a couple smokes together and pass the time, they head into their bedroom.

T 0:20 - im still on the couch, I'm starting to feel funny. My throat is feeling tight and my tongue feels like I have cat hair on it.

T: 0:30 - I'm looking at the hardwood floor, it's starting to flow around and I don't know where the actual grain itself is suppose to be. I look up towards the bathroom and the light is orange, it's giving a weird vibe. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed already, what have I done!?

T: 0:45 - I'm feeling suffocated, I'm starting to freak out a little bit. I need water, I haven't been drinking water! I get up and fill a glass of water and go back to the couch. I sit down and instantly start feeling waves of euphoria, nothing like I have ever felt before. It feels like I am making love to myself, the more I stay still the more the euphoria is coming on. I start feeling orgasmic rushes throughout my body, I'm really enjoying this! Right as I'm at the peak of this wonderful sensation my sisters boyfriend comes out of the bedroom. I feel awkward, almost as if I'm naked, I told him how I'm feeling and he thought it was hilarious. He sat at the kitchen table and smoked a cigarette and I joined him.

T 1:00 - We are talking and I'm explaining everything that's happening, I walked into my sisters room quickly to see how i felt in there, i seen the carpet. It had a few stains on it, the stains started to bleed and go all over the carpet and up the baseboards and I instantly started to freak out. My sisters boyfriend looked at me and said ""it's not that bad man"". I knew I couldn't handle this anymore, I decide to go sit outside and enjoy a smoke by myself to calm down. I open the door and make a loud singing noise and it pierces my ears like a voice from an angel. I'm confused and scared, why did I do that? Why did it sound like that?

T 1:15 - I walk out the door and sit on the front steps, I feel amazing but full of anxiety. The trees are waving at me, everything is so vibrant. The sky looks so beautiful! Wait, where's my water?! 

T 1:25 - I go back inside and I can't find my cup of water. My sister and her boyfriend are in their room blasting music, my water is on their end table and I totally forgot it in there! (Not realizing there is a tap in the kitchen or bathroom) my throat dries up, I can barely swallow, I start kicking the door, ""PLEASE, HELP!"" 10 minutes pass before they open the door, I run in to grab my water. I quench my awful thirst, I feel a little better.

T 1:40 - I am starting to yawn alot, I lay down on the couch because my eyes are heavy, shit is about to get real.. looking up at the ceiling it looks like rippling water, my eyes are slowly closing. I yawn one last time, wait a second, I have been yawning for like 30 seconds. I'm not yawning, I think I'm gasping for air! I'm dieing, this is it. I'm freaking out and screaming, I open up my phone and go on tripsit.me.

T - 1:45 - The people on tripsit told me to calm down, I can't die on mushrooms. Just breath, I will be okay. They are really distracting me from my anxiety, they ask me if I felt like I had to cry and if I was holding back any emotions, I said yes. They tell me to get off the phone and let all my emotions out, they all kept saying my ego was going to die. I said bye and got off my phone.

T - 2:00 - (after this i lost track of time) - my feelings feel hurt, my face scrunches up and I start to cry, I start to wheep.  I'm now sobbing, ouch. Why does this hurt so bad? I am screaming in pain. My son pops up in my head, but I forget what he looks like. I keep repeating ""I just want my babyboy"", Is this real? Why am I saying this, why can't I see his face I don't understand. ""This isn't real, stop this"", my sister comes out of her bedroom to calm me down. They have never done shrooms before and they don't understand what's going on. Neither do I, I pull out my phone and call my dad, no answer.

I call my ex (I forgot we had broken up, I just needed her to tell me everything was okay). She answered the phone and I started babbling, nobody could understand what I was saying anymore, she told me to fuck off and hung up the phone. I started screaming and crying even more. My sister is trying to calm me down but she keeps telling me I am not making sense. ""I'm going to jump in front of a bus"" I jump up and make a run for the door, my sister locks the door. I was a broken record and I couldn't stop it, ""I'm going to kill myself, I'm going to jump in front of a bus"".

I feel pain in my arm and I start to have pain in my chest, I feel my heart and it's speeding up and stopping and starting again. Oh my god, I'm dieing of a heart attack, I go to the bathroom and start throwing up, I fall onto my side and I start to die. I pull out my phone to call 911 but I don't know how to. My sisters boyfriend comes in the bathroom and holds my hand, I'm curled in a ball on the floor. I tell him to call 911, he does. He passes me the phone, I put it on speaker and place it on the tile floor. It went to voice mail,  no fucking way, I'm dead, I'm dead.

Nobody can save me. I can't see anymore, I start seeing visions of my life, all bad memories. Everybody I hurt, all the bad things I did, I realized that I didn't do any drugs and I was just having memory problems, I am an 85 year old man dieing of a heart attack. I think I have memory problems and I convinced myself I wasn't on drugs. I regret everything, the way I treated my ex, not spending enough time with my child. All the hard drugs I have done and the life I had loathed in carelessly. I hear laughter, the whole world is laughing at me, I deserve this. This is all my fault, I am a horrible person, this pain is what I deserve.

I feel as though my soul is being harvested by the devil, I want more pain. This is what I deserve. My sisters boyfriend manages to get 911 on the phone finally and puts it on speaker. Fire, police or ambulance? ""I'm dieing, I deserve to die, I'm having a heart attack"". My sisters boyfriend explains what's going on and then passes the phone back, I feel like the world is laughing at me. The operator asks me what I'm feeling but I keep reliving my horrible memories and all of my regrets. 

I tell the operator that if I die to tell everyone I'm sorry. he said the ambulance was on the way but I knew, I knew deep down he wanted me to die because he seen all of the wrong I have done. He wasn't sending an ambulance. Why am I still dieing, is this what death is? I'm stuck in time forever, to see and feel the pain I caused others in this world. I have no good memories, this is what hell is. I'm going to feel the pain I caused for eternity. I got a sudden burst of energy and jumped up and ran towards the couch, I pulled my pants down and ran around screaming (So fucking embarrassing).

The paramedics walk in the door and immediately start to aid me, they are going to kidnap me and kill me, I know it. ""Please don't kill me"". My sister pulls one of the paramedics aside and tells them I'm trying to kill myself. They grab me by the arms and start to walk me out the door. They force me onto a stretcher and start to strap me in, ""please don't kill me, STOP!"" they put me in the back of the ambulance. I finally focus on the paramedics face (he has a burn scar across his whole face) he wasn't real, He is an alien with someone's face on his own, they are abducting me.

 I was strapped down, I couldn't move, he pulled out a temperature gun (you aim it at the head to take someone's temperature quickly) I thought it was some type of alien weaponry. He aims it in my face, it beeps. I feel pain in my head, I think my brain is melting! ""Please no"". I started calming down, I'm sleepy, I close my eyes and went unconcious.

I wake up in the hospital in a hallway. I look around and I'm no longer tripping, what the fuck just happened to me?!
They psych evaluated me and released me. I walk home and go to bed.

It took me this long to fully understand what happened to me that day, it changed my life. I moved on from my previous relationship and I am now engaged. I quit smoking Crack and I no longer drink alchohol, I have a newborn daughter with my fiance and I couldn't be more proud to be where I am today. I am thankful I was as irresponsible as I was to do what I did. It changed my life.

This is my first report, I did my best, I hope you all enjoyed reading!

"Today shrooms changed my life
Today was a day that has changed my life. I have recently been experimenting with shrooms after doing lots of research and contemplating it this last year. I decided to grow them myself as I didn’t know where to get them locally. I found some spores on line and some all in one grow bags on amazon. The first couple times I took 1.5g and only ever noticed some more vibrant contrasted visuals but nothing much more than that.

Trip 1 (1 week ago)
Last week I decided to take 2.5g in some mint tea. I had a great come up and was dancing around at my desk playing overwatch. During the peak I felt like I needed to shower so I hopped in and turned on some meditation music. I had never meditated before but figured i would give it a whirl. I sat down criss cross apple sauce on the shower floor hands rested on my knees and water pouring over my body. The room was dark with a couple LED night lights giving a very relaxing vibe. The music was perfect, slow gentle and eased me into thought. I focused on breathing and attempted to lower my heart rate. I would glance at my Apple Watch every now and again to see. Starting off around 86bpm and worked my way down to 55bpm. I got lost in thought. Thinking a little about everything.  This lasted about an hour and I got up and was fine. Now this was all still in a level 1 category hardly any visuals just some contrasted colors and slight distortion. It was a great experience and left me wanting to do it again.

Trip 2 ( today): level 2-3
I stayed up all night worrying and sipping on a few beers. My little brother(27) was recently diagnosed with aplastic anemia and does not have insurance. We are waiting for his red and white blood cells to drop in order to get considered for a free clinical trial with a 90% success rate using horse antibodies to destroy and target his cells that are attacking his bone marrow. The stress on myself and my parents/family have been pretty hard lately as he his constantly getting platelet transfusions every other week. I woke up the next morning exhausted and called in sick for work. Slept a few more hours and got up around 11am. My buddy messaged me he was passing by my area and I invited him over. My house was a mess and we began cleaning as I promised my wife I would clean up since I stayed home from work. I had thought about making some more tea prior to my buddy coming over to help lightin my depressed and sluggish mood so when he arrived I asked if he cared to join me. He agreed and I measured out 4.5g intending to double out my dose from last week in order to split between us. I crushed them up and made some more mint tea this time with 4 cups of water. We split it and decided to turn on some of his groove disco music and relax on the couch. About 30 minutes later I had a rush of vibrant contrasted-colors suddenly appear like normal along with some heavy distortion on the brick fire place. I felt ok and we laughed a bit. He was feeling great and getting his jam on. Another 20 minutes go by and I started to feel uneasy. I began worrying that my wife was about to come home to us tripping balls as the visuals increased to a point of making me dizzy. My phone screen was feeling “3D” with double images and I had a hard time focusing. I stood up and walked around a minute and sat back down. I was dizzy and sick to my stomach and realized I had taken more than I was expecting. I don’t usually have much anxiety and up until this point I never really new what it felt like. I was having an anxiety attack. I felt as if my buddy and his music was pushing me from the room. Every ounce of my body screaming to get out of there. I quickly scrambled for a phone charger as my phone was about to die and went to take a shower excusing myself. I attempted the meditation music and tried lowering my heart rate to no avail. I felt as if I was my mind was fighting to stay in reality. I came out of the shower and went back out. My buddy said I looked like shit and asked if I was ok. I let him know I wasn’t feeling good and needed to sleep. He was having a great trip riding his “rainbow commit” to his disco groove music. At this moment my wife called and let me know she was on the way home. She could hear the uneasiness in my voice and I told her I may have accidentally taken to much shrooms and needed her to come home quick. I hung up and got in bed I put on my head phones returned to the mediation music and covered my face under the covers. I noticed the weight of the comforter started to calm me slightly along with the heat and sweat around my body.It took me a bit but I finally started to feel a bit of relief and my mind started wondering. I began thinking about my brother and my parents and how much they are all hurting right now. As my mind started wondering around I all of a sudden had a vivid mental image of my wife’s face pop into my head. I had an overwhelming epiphany. I did not have to share this burden alone. My newly wedded wife of 1.5 years would be there by my side and be my rock. I realized that deep down inside a part of me must of questioned our relationship. Questioned whether or not she was meant for me and if I found “my person” in life. I realized at this moment that I 100% knew she was my one and only. I had thought this to be true prior obviously which is why we got married, but I guess deep down inside there was doubt. Instantly after coming to this realization I felt an overwhelming relief of all that anxiety and stress. I felt this warm welcoming embrace come over my body. It was the most blissful indescribable feeling I had ever felt. I needed my wife with me at this very moment. I Longed for her to experience this feeling with me yet I realized that something amazing just happened and was continuing to happen and I needed to go through this by myself. Some time went by as I continue ride this wave of bliss and emotion. I realized how intimate and personal these feelings were and at least for me, shrooms in general. I realized that my buddy downstairs was in his world and I was in mine and our energies were on different paths. I did some serious soul searching and was briefly tapped on the shoulder. I opened my eyes to the most beautiful thing I had ever laid eyes on. My wife was glowing! She had a golden hugh around here. As if she was my angel sent down from heaven just for me. She was the only one at the moment that got me and would get me even as I attempted to describe to her this life changing experience. She left me alone and I continued to ride the wave out for another hour or so until I came back to reality. My wife thinks I’m a little crazy now and thinks I should lay off the shrooms, but I would give anything for her to witness my experience. I wish there was a way for her to listen to my thoughts as I went through this. A lot of specific thoughts has already started to fade from my memory from earlier today as if awakening from a dream. I feel immense clarity now however. I left a small note on her car steering wheel tonight before I started writing this just letting her know how amazing she is and wishing her a good day as I will be sleeping in when she heads off to work.

This has been a remarkable experience that these words don’t do justice. I realize I was not ready for this trip starting out but luckily I was able to change my element and finally relax myself in order to have this revelation. I hope you all experience the love and bliss that I had a chance to today. I’m still scared to increase my dose and attempt the next level but I believe if I continue to take 2-3g over the next year and practice getting in the mindset I may be ready to take the leap.",Addicted
"LSD - ~1800ug | A totally new experience
Let me start off with saying, I have done a vast amount of LSD in my short lifetime and have done varying doses of this incredible substance. Anywhere from 100ug now all the way up to 1800ug. Before this my highest experience was 1000ug about a year ago. 

Alright let us begin.... (Time stamps are averaged out) 

8:00 AM - I have the 20(I average down to ~1800ug because I am assuming not every tab is 100ug exactly) tabs all ready to consume, I take them and let them sit in my mouth for 30 minutes. 

8:45 AM - I have swallowed the tabs and am eating a nice breakfast, I figure I won't be hungry later on and my body will need the ""fuel.""

9:30 AM - I am starting to feel a ""rush"" of energy that is quite familiar with my higher doses. I am feeling anxiety but I find that almost calming knowing that this is really about to happen. 

10:00 AM - First sign of visuals, my ceiling looks like a river flowing from on side to the other. 

12:00 PM - Last two hours have been ramping up visuals; I would say the effects have really kicked in now. Starting to get that ""fading"" effect where everything seems to fade almost like someone is painting everything as it happens... incredible. 

12:30 PM - I have a fan on and I close my eyes and the wind the fan is producing makes it feel like I am in a frozen tundra laying in the snow.... I get lost in the CEV not even listening to music. 

1:10 PM - I throw on my headset and by now my whole visual spectrum is filled with distortions. I swear even the AIR seems like it has patterns in my peripheral vision. I look out at the bright blue sky and the clouds are swirling into different figures and sky looks like an ocean with tides and the clouds are the sandy white beach. Music feels like it is ""pulsing"" through me; honestly the most incredible feeling I have experienced. I can see the colors on the song around my vision and I can taste the heavy beats; they are thick and delicious. 

2:00 PM - Oh geez, people are here... more specifically my girlfriend. She convinces me to go on a walk and I thank her for this. I can feel the sunlight shine throughout my soul and it warms my entire being. The road is simply flowing down into an endless stream of beauty. 

2:30 PM - The peak is begging and I am starting to encounter some major ego death. Reality is fading away from me and becoming a facade of patterns and pulsing feeling. I can feel the earth ""hug"" me when I lay down on the grass. 

2:45 PM - At this point I am LOST, I don't know if me eating a big meal right after the tabs prolonged the ""real"" kick in but the world is so bright and colorful; I can taste the colors, and feel sight.... I have never experienced anything so beautiful. I listen to ""Bring Me To Life - Evanescence "" and it sends shivers down my spine; Amy Lee's voice sounds so beautiful and comforting that I start to cry. I have such an overwhelming sense of joy I realized that I could die right in this moment and I would be okay with it. 

3:00 PM - My girlfriend is hungry and so am I(She knows I am on Lucy but she has only done it once with me and does not really understand how substantial of a dose this is).. anyways we go to a little Mexican place and immediately she is giving me major anxiety; she wants me to order and pay.... YEAH RIGHT. I can barely read the menu it looks like it is jumping around the sign. I somehow manage to order nachos and some memorizing green soda... damn it is the most beautiful color I have ever seen. 

3:30 PM - I have never really gotten much ""flavor enhancement"" from Lucy but this... this is unreal. It taste like little carbonated creatures are swimming all over my tongue and filling my heart with happiness. 

4:00 PM - There is a baby crying and people are yelling at each other in Spanish; total BAD VIBES are hitting me.. i'm sweating and I just really need to get out of here but I don't want to make a scene. I feel like everyone knows i'm just totally blitz out of my mind. I manage to leave, fuck the food, I am never going back in there again. 

4:35 PM - Movie time!, was not planning on this but aye why not? We were going to see the new Pirates of the Caribbean. The seats in the theater reclined and the instant satisfaction I found myself sitting in this ""heavenly"" chair was so wonderful. 

4:50 PM - I go to the bathroom and the black door with white dots looks like a black hole... it looks 4-dimensional and I know that is impossible but somehow I just know it was 4-dimensional. For whatever reason whenever I take lovely lucy I get pretty bad gas after I drink or eat... so there I am sitting there on the toilet; at first I had anxiety from all the sounds of piss and people walking around but then I just closed my eyes and had ego death, again but in a different way. I keep trying to think of a way to explain my realization but it is impossible to type; you would need to experience it just how I did and that is most likely impossible. 

5:15 PM - What? It is only 5:15? I thought I had been in the bathroom for ATLEAST 1 and a half hours. 

~ 7:00 PM? : The movie ended sometime around 7:00, at this point time was not a thing to me. Usually by now I would be coming down but really it feels the same from the beginnings of the peak... no complaints here. 

7:30 PM - I am back at my girlfriends house and yes it's about that time. Sex. I have never had sex on any drug but weed before and I was ready for this. I don't want to get into too much detail as I know that will just bother some of you but the just of the sexual act was, my girlfriend gave me head. The orgasm I had was like a fucking revelation I felt like all the joy in the world was bottled up inside me and it went pop and rained all over me. It was by far the best feeling in my entire life so far. 

10:00 PM - I had spent the last 2 1/2 hours having sex and listening to music and it was magical. Now I am starting to come down so I walk home. 

2:00 AM - All that remains is a clear head feeling and a complete sensation of well-being. I smoke some weed and end up falling asleep at some point. 

Conclusion: This was by far the biggest and most important psychedelic experience of my lifetime. I experienced two very unique instances of ego-death and had many revelations during them. I can now say I am not afraid of dying. The whole reason I wanted to document this experience is to give a slightly detailed experience of a ""heroic"" dose of LSD. 

I would STRONGLY recommend you progress a ""ladder"" of dosses like I have. Before I did this; I did 100ug, 200ug, 400ug, 600ug, 800ug, 1000ug and finally I felt comfortable enough for this. I would also strongly recommend having someone who you TRUST and LOVE around you. I felt safe the whole time knowing my girlfriend without a doubt loves and trusts me and if shit hit the fan she could take care of me and I think that without her; going outside and interacting with people would of been a complete no-no and might of dulled down the overall experience just sitting at the computer the whole time. 

I really hope this either encourages a fellow experienced psychonaut to leap into ""the rabbit hole"" this type of dose is or to help a less-experienced tripper realize they may need to work their way up. 

One last disclaimer(Yes I know this is already long enough): If you are going to attempt this high of a dose TEST YOUR LUCY. I don't care if your fucking mom sold this to you; taking 20 tabs of a research chemical is most likely going to be fatal or is going to seriously fuck you up. Be careful, trip safely friends!

"First time F*cking with LSD Xtal
This is a long (love) story about my experiences with LSD. About a year ago, I finally got my hands on what I considered to be the real deal. For background purposes, Ive done a lot of substances. It would be faster to name the ones I havent done. My taste in drugs lies mostly in psychedelics, massive doses of psychedelics.


My fascination began after reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Hunter Thompson. I had to know what it was like to try some of the real deal psychedelics from the sixties. Prior to my first acid trips, I had experimented with mushrooms, several 2c-x compounds, dmt, some rcs as well as some 25x compounds. Not a fan of the latter. Anyways, to say the least, I never trusted anything called acid. I would try to hunt down blotters but they were never LSD. They were always 25x bs.


So I stopped looking to the streets for something that practically doesnt exist on the streets anymore. I dont want to get into where I sourced it from, but I had found a powerful new resource for sourcing most any drug know to man kind. For the first time in my life, I had come face to face with this elegant, powerful, fascinating, mind bending molecule, fit on a little piece of colored paper, sitting in the palm of my hand.


The first hits I bought were advertised at 100ug hits. I had purchased a 10 strip. I sold half of it to my friend who was one of my close tripping buddies, as we had both been dying to try this holly grail of the psychedelic kingdom. The first night I had a chance, I cleared everything out of my life for the next day and ate two of the blotters. I got a pretty nice trip. Music induced the most amazing euphoria I had ever experienced. i got some nice tracers, melting walls, brightened visual patters. Pretty easy going standard trip.


Flash forward a few months. My stock ran out. I had tripped twice on cid. I bought another teen strip from a different suppler, advertised at 200ug per hit. These where certainly much stronger that the first batch. The first time I tried the batch, I took 2 hits (400ug). I basically got all the effects as the first couple of trips, just amplified. Along with the tracers, I got some fuzzy visual patterns. My vision became more distorted. But still, no fractals, no intense introspection. There was a very pronounced body load indicitive of a presence of ISO-LSD. ISO-LSD means the chemist who made the acid got lazy, and didnt do a chiral chromatographic separation or two, to isolate the pure dextro-LSD. but you take what you can get. I didnt have $20,000 to start my own small scale production lsd lab.


I spent the next year and a half trying different blotters. I have no doubt that all the stuff was actual lsd. It was all tasteless, active thru straight ingestion (not sublingually like the 25x), and produced effects consistent with what LSD has been described as.


I had a couple of grievances though. I compared the doses of the LSD (as advertised) with dosage scales on erowid as well as anecdotal reports (like reports of potency of acid from the counter culture revolution). The doses of Lsd I was taking should have been producing much richer, more powerful effects. Stan Owsley, sound engineer and acid chemist of the Grateful Dead, use to produce 270ug hits of lsd that were sheering peoples faces clean off, opening their minds to perceptions and realities never conceived by the human mind. I was taking 400ug of modern acid, and getting quite high, having a good time, but it wasn't what I thought it should be for 400ug.


Finally, I scored. I scored big time. For a jaw droppingly low price, I was able to buy crystaline Lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate. 10.2mg I bought. I received it in a uv proof static proof sealed envelope usually used for storing highly sensitive microprocessors. Inside was the crystal, carefully wrapped with love in a small piece of weigh paper (like wax paper for lab use). It was a perfect medium because non of the crystal stuck to the paper. I bought some 15ml dropper bottles, and a fifth of everclear. Using the dropper, I carefully measured 400 drops of everclear into the dropper bottle.


Finally, the last step. I opened the little wax paper packet of LSD crystal. This stuff was so beautiful. I almost blew a nut in my pants when I laid eyes on it. It was the consistency of light tinny crystals. It wasnt really powdery. just really small, pure white crystals. Almost like snowflakes, so white and pure. After drooling over the beauty of the crystals for an hour or so, I made the vial. I dumped the crystals into the vial of everclear. They dissolved instantly on contact with the liquor. . I sealed the vial, gave it a shake, and it was ready.


I couldn't wait to try it. I had made the vial at my friends house. We both dosed pretty much instantly after it was preped. I gave him 8 drops, 200ug. I was a little selfish and took 600ug, hoping desperately to finally reach the peak I had been longing to find for so long. Well hot diggity damn did I find it. We just took the LSD as liquid, right on the tongue as is.


You can feel the stuff sliding down the back of your throat. It has a very distinct feeling. I rinsed it down with some water or soda. I dont remember to be honest. And wow.


This shit hit me almost instantly. From the second it hit my tongue, something felt different. I couldnt quite tell you how. This was about a year ago so I am recalling the best I can. After about 5 minutes, I could fell the come up. I felt a little floaty. A little bit of uncertainty brewing. Did I take too much? Not enough? 10 minutes in and my periferal vision was lighting up like a mother fucker. I was seeing the walls behind me change color. No shit. Like I could see the walls behind me changing spectacular colors, but I wasnt looking at the walls. This applied to whatever was behind me. There was an ora of color behind me that I could somehow see.


20 minutes in and Im bracing myself on my friends couch. There has been no body load but I am coming on hard. This shit hit me almost as hard as taking a hit of DMT. It seriously rocketed me into another realm. Slang shot me off the face of the planet. I realy began to lose track of time here.

I spent the next 20 minutes smoking cigarettes and drinking water. I think I had two sips of a beer. But alcohol seemed like such a primitive, pathetic drug compared to what I was about to experience.

The Peak

I sat down on the couch and loaded up the bong. It was about 35 minutes since dosing. I think my friend had put on some little feat or peter Gabriel or some sort of dank music. I proceed to take two hits from the bong, and things really got sideways from there.

I laid back on the couch, rubbed my eyes. I was getting overwhelming visual changes. I was seeing tracers, color shifts. Any sort of intricate patterns seemed to begin dancing around. The carpet began to creep up the wall. The stairs begin to rotate sideways as if in a funny house at a carnival. All I could remember thinking is, ""I hope I dont have to piss anytime soon because the bathroom is upstairs and I dont know how the fuck I could tackle those fucked up sideways stairs in this condition"".

I lost all touch with reality more or less. I could remain lucid for a second or two, but the trip would suck me back into the oblivion it was creating in my mind.

My friend and I went outside. We wanted a change of scenery. We rolled up some cigarettes, and went for a walk.
It was a beautiful, clear summer night. The light pollution was relatively low. As we walk thru the parking lot, I couldn't help but notice how distorted my vision was. My vision was almost folding in on itself when looking off into the starry sky. But when looking at the nearby parked cars, it seemed to be be like looking thru a wide angle lens or fish eye lens. We walked up to the street.

I sat down on the curb, and lit my smoke. My friend walked half way across the road and became distracted looking up into the sky. We exchanged somewhat sarcastic words to each other, untill I noticed some oncoming traffic in the distance. Hes just standing there in the middle of the road gazing into the night sky with a huge grin on his face and pupils the size of fucking quarters. I shout ""get out of the fucking road before you get run over"". He realizes whats going on and scampers to the other side of the road. We had a good laugh, and walked back to the apartment.

We excepted that we would be up all night. We look at the clock. Its 11pm. We had dosed at 10pm. We both look at each other and simultaneously say, oh fuck. One minute was an eternity. I sit on the couch, foolishly thinking I needed one more bong rip.

I took that rip. Before we began our trip that night, I had prepared a small amount of ghb in a cup of cola. About 2 grams, in case I needed a downer to take the edge off the trip. I drank about half the cola. I lay down on the couch. I feel an energy running from my brain down my spinal chord. I felt like my mind was fucked. I was frying. I literally was frying. I began to get these bizarre audio hallucinations. It was kind of a higher pitched echoy frequency that would descend in pitch until I could no longer hear it. The walls were fluidly waving and morphing.

I closed my eyes. I didnt want to see how distorted everything was. I was peaking hard. I went deep within myself, within humanity. I thought about the anatomy of the human body, how complex we are, how amazing it is that our bodies function automatically. I went deeper. How did we come to be. God didnt fucking put us here. We are the product of shit happens. There is no way that I am.... I, what is I.... I lost my train of thought. I lost my self awareness. There was no way I could possibly exist. No god put me here. So that leaves evolution? So I am the glorified product of some amino acids joining forces into the first proteins, that assembled the first cell, all the fucking way down the line thru trials and tribulations. Millions of years of evolution couldnt possibly yield something as complex as myself, could it... No there is no way that I could possibly exist. And even if I did exist, thru all the biochemical evolution that took place over the last couple million years, there is absolutely no way I could become this intoxicated, and still be alive. I wasnt even intoxicated. I was some different level. Comatose? Catatonic? Maybe. Alive? I couldnt possible be in this state and still be alive. I could feel what I thought to be my brain shutting down. Those poor abused neurons shutting down and shriveling up at the hands of this masterful, powerful chemical. Wow, what a critical analysis of reality...

I opened my eyes and I couldnt see. Everything was white. I could only see white. After about 15 seconds, my vision gradually came back. I was gone. Helpless. I literally thought I wasnt alive. I got up, and moved to a chair. Ok I was alive, but how much longer till I slip away? Lsd has never killed anyone before, will I be the first? I felt like I was dying temporarily. My friend asks if I am alright. He knew I had taken more than him. He was tripping balls, but he was still lucid. He did not realize I took 3 times the dose he did.

He says I dont look so good. I keep telling him I think I am alright. I think I mentioned to him to keep an eye on me tho, like in case I pass out or go unconscious.

I keep thinking that this will be the end of my life. My mom would have to live knowing her son died of a drug overdose. I had to change things. I grab a cigarette, and go outside.

Oh my fuck, fresh air, night sky, cigarette! I start smoking and my trip settles down a little bit. It is still overpowering, but in a more bearable way now. I am about 2 hours in. I think I have an alright handle on it at this point. I spend about 10 minutes just smoking cigarettes, watching the starts dance, watching the fir trees on the horizon sway gently in the summer breeze. The tree's branches were waving, swirling, sparkling, lit.
I go back inside, amazing body high. Floating, FLOATING. No body tension or load to speak of. I lay down on the couch, my friend throws on some Floyd. I throw a zebra print fleece blanket over me. The acid really shifted gears on me at this point. Familiar music, comfort, body energy. I look down, and the black lines in the zebra print blanket were turning into snakes that were slithering up my body and over my shoulders. I was totally at comfort. I saw what appeared to be a dragon come slowly swirling out of the ceiling. It looked Chinese. It slowly swirled around the room in a pleasing manor. I have never actually seen a dragon while tripping until now. I realized I was having my first breakthrough acid trip.

I lay, contemplating life, watching the walls breath, dance, simmer like a mirage for a while as the acid once again shifts gears. I entered the fractal/geometric visuals. I watch as the most amazing, molecular looking geometric pattern began to emerge from the ceiling. It was backgrounded with shades of sunset purple, redish pink and blue.
These abstract and genuinely amazing unworldly visuals persisted for hours from this point. We layed on the couches in his livingroom, listening to music, tripping out, savoring the experience. We would get up from time to time to take a wiz, or have a smoke break. Around 6am we went out and smoked cigarettes as we watched the sun rise on acid. 

It was truly an amazing night. We had some amazing conversations, talking about some of the most random and bizarre shit you could ever imagine. Some of the conversations were deep and philosophical.

I was final satisfied. I had finally had truly pure amazing LSD. I hear people all the time, on the internet and in real life saying ""I did 300 micrograms and it didnt do much"", or ""Yeah i like to take 1500ug and trip ballz"". Well buddy, 1500ug of this shit would land your ass in a psych ward.

I finally knew what Timothy Leary was preaching about. I finally understood why William Lenard Pickard gave up his life to the law to make something that was illegal. I finally understood why this stuff fueled a revolution of liberated thinking and free spiritedness. I finally understood what LSD was all about, finally...

My trip didnt end until about 18 or so hours after dosing. It just slowly tapered off. It was an utter cluster fuck of mind and senses. It really took weeks of processing. What I am writing here is about half of it. Theres a lot more detail I could go into but I am getting tiered of typing. I hope you got some incite about what real LSD is like. I will never fuck with blotters again. Only crystal straight from the chemist. Made with love and care, LSD is an amazing substance with vast potential to change our world. To fucking bad it got labeled as a drug. I still have a big chunk of that vial, sitting, waiting for just the right time to let it unleash its awesome potential...

"[LSD] Half a tab, mild but beautiful experience
10:25 PM  Took 1/2 of one tab - just dissolved, no effects yet.  
  
10:48 PM  Slight dizzy feeling which quickly passed, can taste the alcohol in my beer well. Considering taking 2nd half.  
  
11:07 PM  Just took a hit of weed and effects are feeling slightly more intense. starting to feel slightly anxious, but still coherent. glad i didn't take the second half.  
  
11:18 PM feeling euphoric. listening to avey tare and kria brekken, sounding very good. Thoughts are racing, feeling jittery and wonderful.  
  
It's amazing I feel like I can hear my neurons firing in moments between songs. I feel energetic, but disoriented. I can feel the electricity running through me. I can feel the friction of my blood running. I can hear the high-frequency drone of my ""energy"". My jaw is tense, I have a slight headache. my vision is slightly impaired, sort of like seeing sparkles around everything. Very rapid and frequent thought-traffic. seeing tremendous beauty in mundane things.  Not sure if the drug is affecting me spiritually, but I feel much more ""opened up"".  
musings:
does music have any influence or effectiveness in the spiritual realm, or is the significance purely personal/emotional? That is, does music effect anything in the outside world, aside from our own perception, and how powerful is our own perception? Does music take on a life of it's own after being released? it seems as though all or most music goes beyond what is expected by it's author in ways that can not, most of the time, be understood by the author him or herself, because of the personal experience that listening is.  
  
11:47 PM  Feeling slightly more stable, thought-traffic has slowed a little bit. definitely feeling euphoric, though it is not a ""perfect"" feeling. As expected, music is sounding so intricate, can hear every detail. Physically, not feeling 100%, definitely the worst part of the trip for me. back is sore, headachy, sort of stiff. the nice mental aspects are far outweighing the negative physical aspects, but would love to forgo the physical discomfort. when the visual effects start to get intense i feel anxious, comes in waves. slightly ""seasick"" sort of feeling. feels good to type this though,  there is a certain comfort of expressing my thoughts, even if it is just to myself. definitely remembering the importance of feeling safe while tripping, and understanding why new york can be an overwhelming place to trip, seeing as one is never truly ""safe"" or ""alone"" (which can be comforting in itself somehow).  
  
12:01 AM  feeling pretty stable. definitely high as helllllll though. listening to coyote clean up.   
  
12:30 AM  feeling good, but the physical effects continue to worsen my overall very good experience. listening to deerhunter. definitely not as intimate as the music before, but still working for me. psychedelic effects, and still a ""rough"" rock and roll edge. really fucking good production. lyrics to ""basement scene"" really hitting home for me right now.   
  
""Dream  
A little dream  
All about the basement scene.

"First time trying drugs, 1g edibles and 46ug lsd (bad trip)
First off I just want to say that this is the first time me and my friends tried any real drug, we had only tried nicotine and alcohol and since we thought that alcohol and marijuana had the same effects we were not scared. 
We were only 16y old
The second thing is that where I live marijuana and lsd is illegal.
Sorry for my bad english.
In this story im going to replace my friends names with ""Tom"" and ""Jerry"" 

So me and my friends decided that we should get into some soft drugs so we bought 1g hash each and some lsd and went to Tom's house, it was pretty late in the evening so the first thing we did was splitting the lsd in three and then putting it in our mouths. After 20mins we decided to go to the store and buy some snacks so we started walking and when we got there the lsd still had not dissolved so I started to rub it against the top of my mouth with my tounge and after a while it dissolved completely. We drinks and some chips and then went home. Thats when Tom said that we should make muffins out of the hash instead of smoking it but I said no since his parents would smell it but he just said that his mom is at work and his dad is asleep so I agreed and we started  following a recipe we found online. While it was cooking Jerry suddenly said ""OMG"" and told me to lay down on the floor and look at the carpet so I laid down and saw that the stripes was moving a little and I yelled ""Holy shit!"" We calmed down after a while and started boiling the butter with the newly decarbed hash in it. While it was cooking I hear Jerry say ""Someones pulling up in your driveway"" and I started laughing and said nice joke but thats when Tom responded with ""Oh fuck, its my mom"" and I just freaked the fuck out and ran upstairs to Tom's room. I heard talking downstairs and after a while I try to sneak  downstairs and peak into the kitchen but she sees me and says hi and I almost had a hearth attack but I responded and walked into the kitchen where I just sat down and shut up. She tells Tom that she is tired and walks upstairs. I calm down and suddenly Jerry walks out of the bathroom where he had hid. Tom walks into his backyard and picks up the pot with the hash and butter in it and we keep cooking. After a while we start realising that we are forgetting everything we think about so we start writing it all down. When the muffins are done we split them and get 4 each and that means there is 0.25g hash in each muffin. We start with eating one each and wait an hour and since we dont feel anything we start eating another one and as soon as we finish it the first one kicks in and I freak out. I look at Tom and jerry and they ask me what's wrong but I was to confused to answer and I knew this was just the first one and that the second one will hit soon. Now this is where the fun begins, I dont remember eating the last two muffins but I could definetly feel them, I remember sitting in the sofa next to Jerry while Tom was at the other side of the sofa yelling and freaking out, he started saying stuff that didnt make any sense but that I could still understand somehow and then he started looping which really turned this trip into a bad trip, he started repeating himself over and over and when he realised he was looping back he would scream really loud and then continue looping. After a while he came to the conclusion that it was the drugs fault and he started yelling something like this ""I need to get the drugs out of my system, how do I do that, I go to sleep, how do I go to sleep, a hard hit to the head, i need to put myself to sleep"" and he started repeating that which made me sxared for his life and I tried to calm the situation but I was to fucked. After a while he walked into the bathroom and started puking and thats when my body started looping, my body started walking from the living room past Tom in the bathroom where he would yell at me to get his parents and I would just say yes yes yes, then it would go to the kitchen where it would take a sip of water and then go into the backyard where Jerry was, he was just standing completely quiet while looking at the stars and I would say ""hey"" and bob my head and he would do the same thing to me. This was happening automatically and I had no control over it and it happend like 10 times. The last time I went on the loop I walked to the bathroom where Tom yelled at me to get his parents while at the same time stickinga a wodden stick down his throat to puke but this time he didnt trust me to get his parents so he started walking up the stairs while yelling ""MOM, MOM!"". When he got up the stairs his mom walked out toms parents room and whispered what is it since his dad was asleep, Tom stared her in the eyes for a solid 5 sec before suddenly sticking the stick down his throat and throwing up all over the floor between them and thats when I knew we where fucked. I went back outside and told Jerry that Toms parents know and he just kinda smiled and said mhm and then continoud looking at the stars so I walked back in and when I got upstairs his mom was asking him what we took but he was completely freaking out so I told her ""fortysix ug lsd four six lsd and a litlle weed"" and then Tom says to his mom ""please tell me it is over soon"" while totally freaking out and she says ""it says it lasts for six hours so you better buckle up"" which made him freak out even more and I started saying ""No, only happy thoughts"" to his mom and she was really confused, she took Tom downstairs to the sofa and calmed him down and Tom told me to put something on but I was struggling alot but eventually I managed to put on some anti drug video and I didnt realize what I had done until both me and Tom was freaking out again so I turned it off and walked out of the room while toms mom was trying to calm him down and I got stuck in the loop again, after about 7 laps around the living room, kitchen and backyard his mom told me to go get Jerry so I went to the backyard and told him to come inside and she got us all blankets. Finally we were all in the sofa watching a music video and calming down, thats when I realized the colours and visuals going on all over my fov and it was crazy beatiful. Thats when I closed my eyes and when on a crazy adventure inside my mind that I cant explain. And thats the end of this trip report.
Alot of more weird stuff happend but I dont know how to explain it all.

"Sober psychedelic experience: First ""isolation tank"", 60minutes.
I know this is atypical for the sub so I'll explain what I did and (to my best knowledge) why I experienced what I experienced.

So what did I do? 

Full stomach, bit of coffee an hour previous but otherwise sober. For 60 minutes I stayed in a pitch black room filled to my knees with a highly dense, body temperature water. It's possible to lay on your back and effortlessly float in order to experience (almost full) sensory deprivation. If you haven't heard about this before, what this resulted in was visual hallucinations while I meditated with my eyes open (to make sure that I didn't fall asleep).

So what happened?

At first I saw patterns, dark colors, and nonsensical shapes but as time went on these shapes became more real. I was startled by a messy-haired woman who kept looming over me. She seemed accusatory and my thoughts turned to what I was doing wrong in my life. As my guilt was rising I sat up to dispel that woman. When I did, the ceiling opened to an intensely bright blue sky that caused the darkness that it touched to swirl and undulate. Giant faceless figures of light stood ""outside"", calling to me, encouraging me with outstretched hands. It wasn't that I heard their voices--I've experienced auditory hallucinations before--instead, I knew their thoughts. It was a peaceful and extremely vivid experience.

As the light faded I returned to my dark surroundings and stepped out of the tank five minutes before my time was up. It makes me wonder what will happen when I do it with some pot next time.",Addicted
"My Sub-Conscience and my Ego Meet
Anybody that has not tripped before may have trouble understanding what I’m about to discuss. Fellow trippers can vouch for the fact that, once LSD comes into your life, a key turns in your brain and the world looks forever, if, subtly different. This is my experience of unknowingly taking a journey deep within myself, forgetting that I was still “me”, and meeting who my ego is at my core. While it was difficult to understand initially, my life changed forever in a positive direction. 

There was a time in my life that I would live day by day pondering my reason for existence. Life was good, but felt empty. Life experience in the past made it often difficult for me to like myself and be content, but I had every reason in the world to live in the positivity. I never really allowed myself to think about these things that I’d let weigh me down for so many years. I was existing and doing “well”, but still felt so complacent and lost. There were so many questions that I had, yet I didn’t quite know how to ask them. 

A friend who had recently met Lucy asked if I’d also like to meet her. I’d smoked weed before, but never quite was brave enough (or nearby enough to them for that matter) to try psychedelics. “Sure,” I said. “Let’s give it a shot.”

400ug and about 1.5 hours later and... Lift off. 

The come up was interesting, but then again so was everything else. I was so moved and couldn’t understand why. I started seeing beauty, though I couldn’t explain how. Language started feeling so empty because it couldn’t come close to describing this sense of infinite connection that I was having with the universe and my fellow trippers. I was with my two closest friends and the girlfriend I would end up marrying (she served as trip sitter). We stood on my balcony in the evening and watched the forest in front of us evolve into this fractal part of eternity. Rays of light were transforming into sacred geometry and music was absolutely just owning me. As a musician, I’d been aware of the psychedelic relation to music, but never truly EXPERIENCED it. The music became me and I became the music. 

I remember one moment listening to Death Cab for Cutie’s song Transatlanticism and being so overwhelmingly moved when I looked at my girlfriend and I knew at that moment she would be with me forever (I’d been planning my proposal at the time). At that thought, a lyric in the song said, “I need you so much closer” as though my spirit had spoken that to her. My universe was piecing together and showing me a new reality. 

My friends and I all sat on my floor in the living room and had this immensely deep conversation where there was a palpable sense of friendship vibrating through the room as if all of history was dependent upon us three being friends at this moment. As if the universe itself ordained this moment for us to feel so connected as friends. We could physically feel the warmth of friendship radiating in this conversation. Even our reflections in the sliding glass doors agreed that we needed to all be there at that moment. 

As the peak ended, I foolishly thought my trip was over after about 3-4 hours. Having no experience with Lucy before, my girlfriend and I decided to take a shower and hit the bed. I don’t recall any visuals or out of the ordinary experiences and was pretty well convinced that this trip was over. My lady and I had sex which completely shattered my world, but I just told myself it must just be the endorphins from coming down. After what would end up being one of the most passionate experiences in my whole life, we kissed and laid on our sides of the bed to sleep. 

This is where it gets crazy:

I am a belly sleeper. I closed my eyes, hugged my pillow and laid still. All of the sudden my soul feels like it’s falling. There was no distinct moment or change that indicated this was to come, but I was no longer a version of myself that remembers his life. I was definitely me, but had no memories. I don’t know any other way to say it than to say, “I was... Just.” I existed, but no longer in what I interpret to be the conventional sense. I end up in this dark abyss. Nothing but blackness. No floor, no sky, no body. 

My spirit starts heading toward something it notices in the distance, millions of miles away. I willed myself closer to it and I eventually come upon my body standing up, waiting for me. The only way I can describe this part is using a Fight Club analogy. It was like being Edward Norton’s character without having a body and meeting Brad Pitt’s character, Tyler Durden. I saw this person that was me. He sounded exactly like my own voice when listened through a recording device. I saw myself the way a person having a conversation with me sees me. This guy knew EVERYTHING about me. He held the knowledge to every single insecurity and memory I had. He seemed evil, but familiar. 

He is talking to me but I don’t have a body. He would speak, I would respond telepathically. He began to tell me everything I hated about myself. It was like speaking exclusively to the devil on your shoulder. He’d say what a pathetic person I was, rub my guiltiness earned from a life of being a human being with mistakes in my face, and projected my worries about living on me. He discredited my close friends and the way they see me. He told me constantly that my girlfriend would leave me when she saw who I truly was. He told me that no matter how much I begged God for forgiveness, I was deserving of suffering, torture and hell. 

My spirit began to feel frustrated, angry, and helpless. It was able to respond to everything my ego said, but his argument was always better than my spirit’s was. Eventually, after what felt like hours, my ego started goading me. “You finally see how useless you are.” “Everybody else sees you this way; it’s about time you figured it out.” “You deserved all of your suffering.” Finally, he said this, “You want to die, don’t you?”

My spirit had enough. It screamed with human language at my Ego and said, “No, I don’t want to die!” The blackness snapped down the middle of my spirit’s vision. My ego vanished into patterns that were now breaking the blackness and engulfing everything. As the black abyss was vanishing, it began to vanish inwards toward what felt to be my chest and body, as if they’d joined again. I felt something try to grab me by the ribcage and pull me back into the abyss through my bed. It was like giant hand claws. The adrenaline in my human body shot through my whole being and I woke up on my knees having pushed my hands so hard into the mattress from trying so hard to get away from the claws. My girlfriend looked at my very puzzled, and I’d felt like I saw her in a different, more unified light. 

As I woke up, I had this huge realization. My spirit and ego were in a conflict that I didn’t even know was there. This argument of self seemed to build a bridge that made me feel like a more complete human. I understood myself. I’d realized that I plunged the depths of me and confronted my issues, every single one. I wanted to live. 

I never sought out to have an experience like that, but any time Lucy and I have met since then, she has reminded me of the resolve I made that evening and to continue forward in some way, shape, or form. That experience literally taught me how to better understand myself and made me realize that I can’t take life at face value. Self-examination is SO important for a person and their health. Lucy taught me how to better understand that part of myself and I’ve since been a more unified Me. ",Addicted
"Meditation & Mushrooms
Hello, everyone. I just wanted to throw this here and tell you guys what’s been working great for me. Every time I take shrooms, even with lemon tech, I make it a point to sit and meditate for at least a third of my trip. I have many wonderful experiences like this. Including meeting entities. 

This last shroom trip I took 2.5 g if cubensies and went right to a tree in my front yard, and started meditation, and waited for them to hit. I sat for about 25 minutes before I started really feeling it. 

This trip took me into a deep hole. It was dark and I was looking for light anywhere and then I saw it. From miles above there was one single spot of light, with a rope hanging from the heavens leading into it to the ground. I started to climb the rope, and this was a very tiring experience. My mind and body started to feel strained but I proceeded until I made it to the top. 

When I finally made it out of the hole, I was face to “face” with this being. This being had an inverted triangular head and on each side of its head, it had three eyes; nine in total. This being was beautifully lit up with a gold and platinum light emanating from deep within it and shining so brightly it was almost unbearable. This being came to me(at this point I was very aware of my third eye) and took its fingers and opened my third eye. After opening my third eye, it spat inside of it and told me “though your eye is open, you must still learn to see through it”. After this I floated back down into my body. 

This was by far the most enlightening part of my trip. After I awakened from my meditation I went outside and laid under the stars for hours. Laying under the stars I remembered that mushrooms help us become one with the earth and it’s always awesome to experience that unity, even if it’s only for a moment. ",Addicted
"Found the report of my first trip on a notebook I found looking throught stuff in my closet. Here it is:
Some background information: This happened a few years ago, when I was 18. I took some really strong acid with my cousin (two hits each), and my other cousin (which was sober) would periodically write down what I said into my notebook. I should note that althought I had read up on LSD and its risks I had no idea what to expect from the experience itself, so I was pretty much blown away by it (in an awesome way). Anyway, here it is:

Acid was taken at 1th may, 22:00 pm


23:00 pm- People keep changing colors, but the dark colors dont change, I can still talk properly.


00:00 am- Colors are changing in a brutal fashion and I dont feel my body, everything seems to be fleeting and transparent sometimes, as if I can see through it (including people). I can still talk properly.


00:23 am- Time is flowing really slowly, I feel as if I am outside of my body and into another dimension, as if my mind and my body are separated. I cannot distinguish colors and when I close my eyes I see shapes and patterns.


00:31 am- I closed my eyes and I saw something really weird: there was a piramid witrh an eye on it resembling the one on the dollar bill, suddently the pyramid dissapeared and the eye became the eye of Horus, then the pyramid appeared again and the eye became part of it again (it wasnt the eye of horus anymore).


01:24 am - Time is flowing really slowly and I still cannot distinguish colors, I can still talk normally to people, but I am having trouble in communicating my experience, I will go out of my cousin's house and into the streets later. I dont feel my body at all.


6:25 am - The sun is gonna come out soon, I dont feel like I am outside of my body anymore, and I realize I am hungry, so I am going on the streets to get some food, but first I will watch the sunrise and smoke a joint.


7:04 am - I just came back, when I was watching the sun rising I suddently recovered my perception of colors, and so did my cousin at the same time. When that happened every color seemed really intense and the day seemed beautiful. I never appreciated the beauty of the world like I did in this moment.


9:38 am - I don't feel tired at all, altought my vision is distorted and my pupils are really dilated I seem to be otherwise sober. I wonder if I will get really tired once the effect wears out",Addicted
"Meeting my self': 5 dried grams of Magic Mushrooms While Meditating in silent darkness
Meeting my self'—3 dried grams of Psilocybe Subaeruginosa (equivalent to 5 grams of Psilocybe Cubensis) while meditating in silent darkness. 

Last night I decided to finally attempt the famous Terrence Mckenna '5 grams in silent darkness' trip for the first time. It would end up being by far the most intense trip of my life. Here is my story. 

My previous trip (about a month ago) was the first time I had ever tripped alone, and I spent the bulk of the trip in my silent bedroom with my eyes covered lying in bed, although this dosage was just 2.1 grams (equivalent to 3.3 grams of P. Cubensis). I also spent most of that trip writhing and wriggling in my bed, and getting up to go to the toilet three or so times. I found that trip to be a success, given I was able to get through it without any fear or anxiety—a feat which I had only been able to achieve for the first time earlier this year on an even lower dose. My goal for my next trip was to do the full 3 grams, and also, to see if I could keep my body perfectly still and relaxed throughout the trip. I got this idea from listening to interviews with Martin Ball, who in his experience in administering and guiding 5meo-dmt trips, says he has observed trippers twisting their bodies into asymmetrical positions when their ego is clinging on and resisting the break-through, and encouraged his clients to try to maintain a relaxed, symmetrical body position through the trip—a kind of physical way to surrender to the experience, in addition to the mental surrendering which is so crucial. So, I had a goal to spend the entire trip lying on my back in my bed with my arms lying relaxed to the sides of my torso (I also got the idea from Martin Ball that having your arms covering your chest is a defensive, protective position, and so having the chest open and exposed is further conducive to the physical surrender). 

So, I gulped down my shroom tea in about 30 seconds, got into this relaxed position in bed, covered my eyes, and began to try to get into a meditative state—noticing my thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations and observing them as they arrived and left in waves (I believe this meditation technique is called Vipassana, and I have been practicing it infrequently for 3-4 months). The crucial part of this kind of meditation is to be committed to staying still—to resist the urges to move or get up that the mind constantly generates. I was able to maintain this still position for the first 2 and a half hours of the trip. 

The come-up was fast and extremely intense. The first feelings I noticed, about 10 minutes after drinking the tea, were waves of energy and pressure that suddenly swept through my body. The sensations were kind of like heat, or a physical pushing, and they quickly started to come more frequently and more intensely. Soon after this, my first visual perceptions began, accompanied by much stronger waves of the physical energy sweeping more and more rapidly and forcefully through my body. My visuals consisted of a range of solidly-coloured (subdued fluorescent pink, green, yellow, solid black and white), tessellated, geometric shapes, rotating, stretching and contorting amongst themselves, and corresponding with the waves of physical pressure and energy sweeping through my body. As this intensified, I had the sensation that these shapes were squashing, stretching, and twisting my body and head like a baker kneading dough. I also had the sense that I was lying on a kind of operating table, looking up at these kind of alien-esque shape-entities that were crushing my body and head, then passing me onto the next set of alien-esque shape-entities to do more contorting. Although this was a very intense experience, I knew I was safe, and so I surrendered to these shape-entities and let them do whatever they wanted to me. 

This period of the trip seemed to last about 30 minutes, and eventually the intense physical waves of energy seemed to subside and the speed and ferocity of my visuals subdued. This marked the start of the main body of the trip, which was marked by a range of feelings, revelations and experiences, the order of which is difficult to recall. The first main feeling I can recall was this sense that objectivity and subjectivity were not distinct anymore. I could not really identify as an entity or a being that was separate from anything external to me. It felt as if 'being' was just this one phenomenon which encapsulated the entire gamut of possible experience—that there was no difference between 'me' and 'not me', between what 'I did', and what 'happened to me'. My sense of agency was completely gone. The only thing I could be sure about was that something was happening. It was also quite extraordinary to comprehend that even in this incredible state, the 'volume' or 'intensity' of awareness or consciousness seemed the same as a regular sober state or the state on any kind of other drug I have experienced. There was basically the present moment—which I was aware of—the contents of which would evolve moment to moment, but which could never become 'more full' or 'more empty'. Even the lack of a feeling or sensation in a given moment was offset by space, which itself had the same 'volume' as any sensation or feeling that might have been there. I interpret this now as the idea that consciousness is always complete. It never needs anything more, and never has too much. It is steady and eternal. Each moment is perfect and whole regardless of its contents. 

This experience led me to begin to question—what am I? My ideas that I have previously always had about who I am pretty much all depended on the idea that I was distinct from the external world—that I was an entity that interacted with things that weren't me (other people, objects etc.). Now, with the idea of my separateness from the world inaccessible, non-sensical, and incomprehensible, I had almost nothing to go off to answer my question. Who the hell am I!? 

All I could be sure of in this state, was that SOMETHING was happening. I was having thoughts, feelings, sensations, and visual and auditory perceptions. There was not 'nothing'. Quite the opposite. There was 'everything', and I started to realise that there ALWAYS HAS BEEN everything. Every single experience, thought, emotion and feeling I have ever had, which now are only accessible to me in the form of memories, 'I' had. That is to say, the only thing I can possibly be sure about is that they happened, and 'I' experienced them. What a revelation! What 'I' am, must be the very awareness or consciousness that has experienced and been witness to every single thing that has ever happened to me. I am not the 'idea' I have about who I am (one might call this the ego). That 'idea' is simply a pattern of thought that has been repeating for my entire life, and fooling me into believing in its existence and reality. What 'I' ACTUALLY am, is an awareness, a consciousness, that has existed for eternity (as far as I can perceive, given I don’t remember the start of my existence), which has been the witness to my thoughts, feelings, and sense-perceptions for my entire life. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my 'idea' of who I am, doesn’t really exist. I found out who I truly am, for the first time in my life. 

After this incredible realisation, a lot of tension became released from my body that I didn't notice I was holding. I had just come face to face with my actual, true self—my pure consciousness. I had finally broken through my mind, which had been preventing me from encountering my pure essence for my whole life. Suddenly, my experience became very soft and delicate. I had let down every single guard from my pure being and exposed my self to itself for the first time ever. It was so fragile and vulnerable. It was very cautious of letting me get close to it—afraid of what might happen to it now that it had no protection whatsoever. My body had become extremely relaxed and utterly limp, perhaps it had lost tension that it had been holding onto for years, even decades. I saw my pure, vulnerable, exposed self—so shy and nervous. I realised what a profound moment this was. I was meeting my true self for the first time. I felt an immense care and love for my shy, vulnerable self. All it wanted was to love, and to be loved, and I loved it. I approached it very slowly so I could get closer to it without scaring it. I began to touch it, lovingly, caringly, slowly, making sure that it was feeling safe and comfortable with the amount of contact, which was more than had ever been made. It was a very similar experience to the most loving and caring kind of love-making, where two people are completely engaged and completely present with each other, and every move each one makes is determined by how the other receives and accepts it. My pure self was letting me meet it, letting me into its most vulnerable space, and accepting me! It embraced me. I had earned its trust, and I was able to get closer to it than anyone had ever gotten. I effectively met my self, and made love with it. It was possibly the most beautiful and powerful experience of life. 

I opened my eyes and wriggled my fingers and toes around this point, and took in some deep, euphoric breaths as I reconnected to my surroundings. This was probably about 2 and half hours after consumption, and I was seeing a quadrupled kaleidoscope of my ceiling—some of the heaviest open-eye visuals I have ever had, which seemed to be a predictable level considering the profundity of what I had just experienced. I lay for a while watching the ceiling with my arms out like a starfish, breathing deeply, basking in the beauty and glory of my existence and what had just happened to me. A phrase came to my mind and I couldn't stop repeating it. ""You are your home"". What this meant to me was that no matter where you are physically, and whomever you are with, you are ALWAYS with your self. Your self is your home. You should love your self, you should get to know your self, because it is the only thing that has always been with you and always will be. To not know your self is to live a life of distraction and illusion, and to not care for and love your self is to harm your self—to disrespect your only home, your eternal home. I got out of bed and wrote on a piece of paper so I wouldn't forget these messages—""You are your home"", and beneath, ""YOU have been here through everything that has ever happened to you."" The second phrase I very carefully crafted to try to embody the insight I had about what my true self is in a way that I could interpret in a sober state. I intended it to cut through the 'idea of my self' (the ego) which my mind continually perpetuates, which changes and evolves in content and quality over time, in contrast to my true self (my pure consciousness/awareness), which is always steady and whole, and always has been, despite my inability to recognize it for my whole life. With the bulk of the trip over, I rode out the final couple of hours of the come-down listening to music with my housemate. 

This experience has been an enormous milestone in my personal journey, and has lent credence to many inklings I have been having since I began paying closer attention to the contents of my mind about a year ago. I never really understood how one can have a relationship with oneself so viscerally until now, and I have a renewed sense of awe for my life.

"Junkie in Wonderland
Dosage: 1300 - 1400 micrograms of LSD in liquid form, ~300mg of heroin prior to dropping
Route: Sublingually
Duration: 18 hours
Test Subject: 150lbs, male, 19 years old

This story starts when I was 19 years old, was fairly experienced with LSD and a few other psychedelics. Me and my best friend at the time, we'll call him Chris, had been tripping quite a bit on the weekends. This weekend we were informed that his parents would be gone the whole week, leaving us a mansion to trip in with an infinite amount of possibility. I was addicted to opiates at the time, and was using around a half gram a day, snorted of heroin. After dosing, and taking the boy around the same time I had no desire to redose which is very unlike me. 

We discussed inviting over our girlfriends, tho decided that because we wanted to go as far down the rabbit hole as mentally possible it would be for the best if they didn't come. 

Fast forward to Friday after school, were flying down the highway to acquire the doses. We get there, expecting him to have tabs, instead he has two different vials. One for me, one for my buddy with around 1400 micrograms in each vial. Originally my plan was only to take around 400ug. So that's what I did. I took what I eyeballed (very risky and stupid decision here) to be around 4 doses. I used an eye dropper and put the tasteless liquid under my tongue. It felt like a drop of water but I knew what I was in store for. 

My tongue started tingling. This is where it really begins. 

T - 0:15: I'm starting to feel something, though it could simply be placebo. My hands are getting cold, and a tingling sensation is surging through my body like tiny little lightning bolts. 

T - 0:30: Were almost home, tho I'm tripping balls. My friend wanted to wait till he got home to trip, though i didn't want to wait. So I took part of my dose right away before driving back home. I remember feeling like I was playing a car driving simulator on the old school gameboy. Everything had a very electric vibe to it, I could hear a car horn from a mile away, I swear. 

T - 1:00: I'm tripping a little too hard at this point. My friend even can tell I'm having a rough time. I'm not really communicating well at all and have retreated to an empty room to try to figure out why I'm feeling how I'm feeling. I convince myself that what I was doing was wrong, and that my girlfriend would inevitably break up with me if she knew. This sent me down a weird path. I caught myself before going too deep, grabbed an orange, walked into the kitchen, threw it at my friend and exclaimed, ""I'm all better now"". Don't ask me why I threw the orange, throwing fruit around seems to be a habit of mine and my friends on acid. I'm smiling just recalling this. 

T - 1:30: We are now doing what we normally do while on doses, listening to infected mushroom, converting vegetarians. It's sending me to a different place, a much more visually distorting place. Me and my friend giggle like two school girls for what seems like hours. We decide to go on a walk in the woods outside his house. The trees seem to breath with us. For a moment we feel almost telepathically connected to nature. It was a surreal and beautiful feeling. 

T - 2:00: We head back inside to smoke a joint, this is when my peak had just started. The visuals at this point were all moving with each other, the rooms of he house all seemed to be morphing together to create just one giant room. I remember all of a sudden my phone ringing (which is odd, generally I turn it on airplane mode when taking acid). It's my girlfriend. I answer the phone, and to my surprise after admitting I was tripping balls in my underwear at chris' house, she laughed, and told me to have a great night and to text her letting her know I'm doing alright later that night. I was completely dumbfounded. She never responds this way to my drug use. Something came over me, a feeling that is hard to describe where I felt invincible and wanted to take things as far as possible. 

T - 3:00: At this point the time of events is a guessing game. I took what was left of my vial in the refrigerator and put it all in my mouth. I don't know if I was feeling suicidal, in the sense that I had nothing to live for, or invincible, where I felt nothing could touch me. Maybe a bit of both.

T - 3:30: This is really bad. I'm starting to lose track of who I am and where I am. Me and my friend are mindlessly wandering around, only to find each other and be super happy that the other person was there. Time distortion is becoming more and more apparent. I can't seem to keep track of anything anymore. I give into it. I take a deep breath and accept the death of my ego. All of a sudden, a new wave of electric tactile sensations surges through my body. 

T - 4:30: I am a glass of orange juice. So far that's the only thing I'm really sure of. Acidic, orange, juicy, and I come from a fruit. Idk man, i think orange juice isn't the worst thing a boy could be, tho it seems I'm okay with that. I throw another orange at my friend. He giggles, then returns fire. We both laugh, then cry, then laugh more wondering why we're crying. We both talk about how LSD is by far the best chemical we've ever put into our bodies, then go to different rooms again to explore further. 

T - 5:00: There is no me anymore until later into the story. No longer an ""I"" component. All of me has melted into a puddle and has been swept away. I am everything and everything is me. I feel an interconnectedness to everything and everyone around me. A level of empathy I wasn't ready for. I felt their pain. I felt nature's pain. I felt my own. My visuals were insane at this point. Almost too much. The house was collapsing all around me and then being rebuilt. I took a bath for some reason and ended up thinking I was lost in an ocean. My mind was creating these wild scenarios and it would then fill in the blanks. Crazy. 

T - 10:00: A good amount of time has gone by and I'm still tripping balls. Wonder if it'll ever end. It's getting to the point where I'm tired, and want to sleep, but know sleep is no where near achievable in my current state. Maybe later. 

T- 17:00: Still tripping. Starting to worry about HPPD. My teenage mind is going in a million different directions. Finally I ask my friend for a benzo. He gives me .5 xanax. I fall asleep about an hour later, tho the benzo didn't do much. 

This is a story about 6 years ago about a boy who didn't understand what LSD had to offer, was incredibly careless, and could give a shit whether he lived or died. I wasn't even completely depressed, it was more of a, ""I don't care"" type feel. I have found ways to feel more empathy towards other after this trip, and started taking care of myself more. 

I wish I could tell you it gave me this pronounced inside of myself at 19, but the only thing I know for sure is that I'm a glass of orange juice. 

Love and peace everyone

"Had the best trip of my life yesterday
So yesterday morning my partner and I each dropped 150ug and went on a hike in the rocky mountains, which led us to a beautiful clearing surrounded by miles of forest in any direction and an absolutely gorgeous unobstructed view of the peaks at Breckenridge. We spent about four hours in a 20x20 ft square within the field, wandering around some before finally laying down on the ground, using our backpacks as pillows. Aside from a brief moment of panic and unease when I realized that one of the beer cans in my backpack had burst (crushed between the weight of my head and the rock underneath it), this was an absolutely incredible and insane experience. I am not one to typically experience intense visuals on psychedelics (although I definitely have a more pronounced visual trip on psilocybin), but this was unlike anything I have ever experienced. I felt as though my body was being absorbed into the earth below me, and the clouds which initially looked like neurons that were morphing and multiplying before my eyes eventually took on a kaleidoscopic pattern containing all-seeing eyes and visions of Hindu goddesses. This was by far the most intense peak I've ever experienced, and I'm a bit disappointed that I pulled myself out of it as it was getting really all-encompassing, because I think I was on the verge of ego death, which I have only experienced once before on a very difficult and unpleasant trip. This time, however, the gradual dissolution of my sense of self was deeply comforting, rather than disconcerting. Shortly after this, we headed back to where we were staying, and I put on the first John Prine record and related to every lyric so heavily that I sat and cried for at least an hour, because I was finally able to work through a lot of unresolved grief that I never allowed myself to fully process following the overdose death of a childhood friend back in December. I felt such profound acceptance and peace despite the fact that I was crying tears of sadness. The bulk of the trip only lasted about 7 hours, though the afterglow persisted for at least another five. We spent the afterglow at an incredible Mexican restaurant within walking distance of our place, talking about the sense of beauty and acceptance that we had both rediscovered during the trip, overlooking a pristine mountain stream with kids playing and people fishing. It was so incredible and I'm still at a loss for words. I really think it might have been the best day of my entire life. I feel kinda corny saying this but I truly love LSD.",Addicted
"LSD trip and Spiritual Awakening
Hello everyone, before i get started i would like to share a little backstory about myself. Im a college student and for about 6 months now ive been experimenting with psychedelics and have done everything from Shrooms, LSD, 25i-NBOME, Ketamine, MXE, DXM, MDMA, Salvia, and smoke pot everyday. So i wasn't that unaccustomed to psychedelics and after having many ego destroying moments over the course of those months, and i was becoming more comfortable with myself and more confident as a person. I also opened my third eye following an OBE i had on DXM and i started to pursue full self enlightenment, and thats when my life pretty much changed forever... 

So one day following 3rd plateau DXM trip, me and my friend who i will refer to as X, picked up 2 sheets of high quality LSD. When got back to the room we decided to smoke a few bowls of salvia 25x, and wait for my other friends to come so we could sell them 2 strips of LSD. Eventually the two kids showed up for the strips and my friend X who was still a little wonked out by the salvia misunderstood them and cut out two huge ass tabs for them instead of strips. These things mustve been the size of 4 to 5 normal sized tabs. After a good laugh X cut them their strips and they left, but we were both stuck with these oversized tabs of lsd. 

Both me and X had a bit of experience in the past with lsd so we thought it was a good opportunity to test the quality so we both stuck the tab on our tongues and braced for impact. Before when i did LSD i remember my come up being pretty slow and not feeling anything for a good 45 mins to an hour of taking the tabs. NOPE, a few mins after dropping i could feel the energy from the tab flowing through my body. Now, I was a little worried i mightve taken a bit too much LSD but i was in good company, there was X and X's roommate (who well call D), and i know that there was the kids that we sold the lsd to already dropped an hour or so ago, so i was pretty much ready for what was in store, or so i thought. So in the mean time we played super smash as me and X waited for it to fully take effect.

The LSD was gradually taking effect as i was getting fantastic tracers, and the familiar fractalizing visuals i was accustomed to with LSD, but it had only been 30 minutes and im tripping as hard as i was 2 hrs into my previous LSD escapades. As i was sitting playing super smash when all of a sudden i felt it really start to hit me as i pretty much cant play video games anymore and throw the controller away and run over to the computer to look up some music to play to keep myself centered as i can feel myself becoming more and more out of touch with reality. I put on some crystal castles and a few minutes later i completely lose touch with reality and everything associated with it. It feels as though my body was completely destroyed as disassembled like every atom of my body separated from one another. I had no concept of the self. I was just an entity, a being just a drop in the swimming pool we call our consciousness. I felt reunited like i belonged here and I was convinced that i had died. I was sad i was leaving my family behind but i was happy when i realized that we would all be reunited one day and to wait out their deaths so we could be one forever. I was free. Free from the burden of humanity i felt all my past memories melt away and i wasn't any one thing, i was everything. I became a fractal ever expanding and all encompassing and all knowing. I realized that this fractal is pure consciousness which is also what i interpret as being GOD and I am part of him as is everyone else on earth and we are one and we are all being. 

I then saw my body from the outside and what looked like an Alex Grey painting and i constantly went from looking at my body from the outside and then rejoining my body as i weaved throughout myself as i surfed the very fabric of time as it repieced the memories associated with the trip into my psyche. I relived these events but through the lens of an observer that was not the person living the events. I felt like i was on autopilot as my body was doing things but my mind was trying to make sense of what i was doing. Everyone was looking at me strangely as i basically made a fool of myself acting like an idiot but i didn't care and neither did X who i feel like we have a connection and would consider one of my only true friends. I felt as though i knew everyones thoughts and that the people laughing at my expense dont understand the true beauty of LSD and that they use it to just get fucked up and care so much about how they act on it and people are so caught up in how others think of them that they dont take time to care about what you think about yourself. 

During the trip as I would return back into my body I tried to leave messages to my friends to tell them what is going on and the profound messages i was receiving from the other realm! I run to the computer and type **""We are all part of a universal consciousness that is pure love, but no matter what or how you convey that to other people they will never know""**. Thats all i could type as i then was ripped again out of my body and thrown into many other scenarios where i feel as though im trying to convey this all to X, as we are lost in the woods in the dark and theres a 10 inches of snow on the ground and trying to find our way home as were laughing and having the best time of my life. I cant stop laughing! Im laughing at the sheer absurdity of life, and how life here is a just a joke! After the trip when i finally completely regained consciousness and tried to piece this all together it was so profound that i was anything at all and so humbled that i was, and that i ignored this and my own divinity all my life it was enough to make me cry for hours, but not tears of sadness it was tears of joy that **I simply am**! Much like in the old testament when Yahweh says ""I Am that I Am"". I also realized that LSD and other psychedelics are on this earth as a tool for humans to realize their true divine nature.

"monthly solo trip
Its been 3 months since I started an experiment. I've been tripping in nature, by myself, about once a month. I live in Marquette Michigan US and the nature around here is pristine. Its a time for me to re-evaluate myself and the reality around me. I started doing this purely out of curiosity. My life is generally pretty good and I'm happy, but I'm always looking for a deeper understanding of life, and who I really am. Nature photography is an important hobby of mine and I love to document my journeys through the woods in that way. I also bring a trip journal out and record any important thoughts.

Yesterday was my third solo trip I arrived in the morning around 10am. A beautiful place called Harlow lake. My plan was to walk around the lake for a while then go up a ridge line and chill on a mountain peak I knew of up there. I eat one big ass shroom weighing 2.4g and began my journey. After that I put my phone away so all the time from here on are approximate. I made my way to a rocky little peninsula on the lake and sat down to wait for the effects to kick in. I pass the time taking pictures of whatever interests me, some fish along the shore, a heron by the swamp. After more than an hour I still wasn't feeling much, just the usually kind of shaky/stoned feeling but not tripping. I knew then and there that this would be a gentle ride but there was still more to come. 

I decided a change of scenery was in order and made my way for the mountain peak. About halfway to the top it was getting pretty hot and I sought shelter in a shaded area to record some thoughts in my trip log. By now the shrooms had pretty much kicked in, no crazy visuals but I was in an entirely different head space. I felt entirely alone, its hard to explain but I couldn't even feel my own presence. I was just an observer free to explore anywhere. As I wrote in my journal I didn't see my hands writing, the words were just being written on the page. I heard some shuffling in the leaves next to me, and I looked up to see a pine martin checking me out. I watched him approach me, I could feel his curiosity as he slunk silently under the leafy plants on the ground. I've never seen one of these up close and it was hard to contain my excitement. Of course my camera was just out of reach and I got up as slowly and quietly as possible. To my surprise he didn't seem to care when I got up. He just casually hobbled along in the other direction. I followed him for a while, and got at least one decent picture. 

Now it was time to make my way to the top. I didn't turn around to look at the view until I made it to the highest point. When I did it was absolutely humbling. It's a wide panoramic view of the rugged landscape as it meets lake Superior. I had been up on this hill at least 10 times before but it felt like I was seeing this view for the first time, with infinitely more detail than I had remembered. I just stood there for a good 15 minutes analyzing the massive landscape in front of me. Each hill, tree, rock outcrop, body of water was entirely unique. I wrote down ""If i'm able to bring back 10% of what I felt today it will be a success"" Eventually I found a nice shady spot to set up my hammock and chill out during a very comfortable come down. 

Today I'm totally back to normal physically and much more grounded mentally. there's something about nature that is incredibly healthy for our psyche and we could all benefit just by spending more time outside.

If anyone is interested some of those pictures can be seen here. The pictures from this trip are the 9 most recent ones on my profile. Thanks for reading! http://500px.com/fiveaces",Addicted
"200 mg ketamine, 450 µg LSD, 2400 µg 25i-NBOME trip report (x-post r/drugs)
I will preface this by saying that I have had numerous experiences, with psychedelics and dissociatives, this was, however, my first experience with LSD.


I had, had numerous experiences tripping with other people, and although the social loops where often entertaining, I found myself unable to complete delve into the trip. I wanted to have one last trip, the one trip to rule them all.


I finished my paper, and took two tabs of acid. I bumped the ketamine in careful doses over the course of the trip. And took the NBOME when i wanted to completely melt into the blackness. This was to be an extraordinary journey, from which I would not be able to escape (primarily because my friend had taken my keys without me noticing, and I didnt want to call people at 3 AM with a head full of acid, having lost my keys).


I closed the lights and put a mattress in my living room, i fed the cats, and put on an 8 hour long playlist consisting largely of apollo by brian eno, and stars of the lid.
When i finally did take the last bump of ketamine closed my eyes, and lied down, I could feel myself falling through multiple layers of soft enveloping blackness. I forgot myself, and experienced suffering and joy thousandfold.


The trip jumped through time and space and i saw numerous scenarios playing themselves out around me. I experienced killing native americans with a colt from horseback, and having my children killed by white skinned invaders, with strange weapons I didnt understand.
I was both the perpetrator and victim of every single act of evil, but also of every act of kindness.
I saw the girl I fancy being shredded in half by a circular, and i saw POW's returning to their families.


I felt like I was rocking a newborn with my left hand, and hunting slaves with a rusty spear with my right. I experienced countless events from all across history, all playing themselves out with me in the middle of them. Human nature showed all of its faces to me. I felt like i understood. No longer did I feel part of some small brotherhood of people with whom I could relate, people like me. But instead with all of humanity, with this extraordinary species, with all of our pain and malice, kindness and joy. Across history, the drops of causality, the actions of every single human being, had made the well stir in that exact fashion that created me.


I could see at my feet what i can only describe as a giant black vagina/flower, through the floors I could see the flowers of the people in my apartment. And I could see the tubes, the tubes that led to the singularity, which manifested itself as a giant tree. I knew that everything was a result of everything else.


Towards the end my brain let me have one single scene of pure unadulterated awesomeness, void of any imminent philosophical implications.
I was standing on top of a cliff, at the bottom of which, only a few feet of sand separated the almost vertical wall from the ocean. I looked out over the endless waves, and from behind the sun an eagle appeared. I drew the string of a bow I didn't know I had (Kyodo style of course, holding the bow above my head, pulling it down and drawing the string, and then releasing, all in one swift motion) the arrow flew, and it was as if the air held it's breath in anticipation. While mid air, I felt the gravity of the world shift towards the arrow, suddenly the cliff was horizontal, immediately acknowledging this, I jumped into a diving position. Speeding through the air at terminal velocity, the arrow pierced the heart of the eagle only a split second before I caught it. Holding the eagle and the arrow, my ballistic arch gradually fell, and I broke through the surface of the ocean, barely stirring the surface and still holding my prey.",Addicted
"Trip Report: First time, Cubensis 2.3g
Wow all I can say is 10/10 would trip again. I don't know how much detail I should put in this trip report, but I guess I'll just summarize my feelings during the experience. My guy shorted my about .7 and I made a mistake of eating .5 lemon tekked(is that right? haha) a few days back which I should've definitely saved so I ended up having 2.3 just straight up.

I took them around 12:15 and went to the nearby trail so my friend could smoke a bowl. We sit down, and I await the oncoming experience, but I wasn't expecting anything, just waiting for it to show me the way. I guess the first alert was around 1:00. My senses started getting a little heightened, not much. By 1:15 I have this sense of unity with the trees around me, and I can feel the life force of the planet it was really amazing. I look up to see the clouds and holy shit, they look like the most beautiful things I've seen.

By 1:30 we start to head back to my place to just chill because it's really hot outside. It's just pure awe. Life feels vibrant, glowing with love and happiness. It feels as if my eyes tune into a different frequency or something because I really appreciate the natural beauty of the world. I was fully in control however. I was longboarding down my hill to my house and I have a moment where it feels like the hill just didn't end for a while. We go to my house and we sneak in through the basement and we just chill for the next 2 and a half hours. 

We(mostly my friend) watched american pie as my sense of time is really fucking distorted. I wanted to really experience some visuals so I did what I read makes you see a lot and turned off the lights. Pretty cool I guess, my dosage wasn't high enough that I saw too many OEV (occasional wavyness or breathing of the room) A lot of epiphanies popped through my head and I learned a lot (some details too personal to share), but basically it really showed me some things I needed to change in my life or appreciate a lot more than I did.

"LSD and the Oculus.... Fun times indeed.
\(cross post from Riftintothemind\)

Spent some time on the Oculus on acid, and it was very interesting. During the peak of my experience, I couldn't handle VR for more than very brief stints. But on the way up and down it was amazing.

I was a bit worried about ""losing myself"" in VR during the experience, and before putting on the headset kept repeating ""remember, this is only a simulation..."". And I kept that in mind throughout the VR experiences. But when I took off the headset, I suddenly concluded that all of life was just a simulation and no different from the Oculus.

I found that passive ""experiences"" worked far better than trying to actually play a game. Robot Recall was way way too stressful. But ***Fantasynth: Chez Nous*** was awesome, as were most things I could sit back and just observe. Played with **Soundself**, which was interesting, and has so much potential. Even ***Aircar*** was incredible. ***Surge*** was intense, and probably not for everyone.

I wrote up the [experience here](https://www.trippingly.net/lsd/2018/4/29/lsd-and-the-oculus-rift). \(entirely non\-commercial blog, btw\). Will continue to update as I try more software out.

"First time tripping on shrooms
I have tripped on acid a good handful of times but shrooms is a totally different experience, well at least for me so here it goes.

T: 0:0 Ate the eighth of shrooms of South American Cubenzi with some chips just because they tasted like shit 

T: 15- Already started noticing small effects in the background but disappeared when I looked at them

T: 30- I was already coming up because I began to see small patterns move back in forth, but they were all in sequence. I decided to go on a walk to Washington park which was just a ten minute walk. When I stepped outside the door I was hit and I went very light headed but it faded away after a few seconds. I was walking down the road listening to some Flatbush zombies and the tress started swaying back in forth kinda cartoon like.
  
T:45- I arrived at Washington park. By the minute the trip was just hitting me harder and harder. The trees were swaying back and forth, as if they were shape shifting in place. I was walking on one of the trails and it felt like I was part of nature.
T:1:00- I was peaking within an hour of the trip. I was peaking pretty hard so I decided to lay down somewhere. I picked a spot to lay down excluded from the main trails. When I was laying down I felt locked into the ground but a good way. The birds chirping enhanced, but every sound I heard was enhanced but it echoed at the same time.  The sunset was so beautiful to watch. I lost track time laying down because I was so focused on my surrounds because I was so intrigued. 
T 1:45 I’m assuming I was laying down for a good bit of time so I decided to continue walking on the trail to the top of the mountain because there is this gorgeous view point up there. I arrived the top. Everything around me was so cartoon like but intensifying in my face back and forth. The view of the whole town was just amazing. I decided to call it a day and walk home. I have learned a lot from this trip, it was very self cleansing because I was depressed at the time. Overall, this trip was very life changing, On my new perspective how I think of life.  ",Addicted
"Benadryl Tripping: Terrifying In the present, insightful in the future
Benadryl, or Diphenhydramine, is a deliriant of the antihistamine drug class. Deliriants are considered to be actual hallucinogens, due to extreme visuals that are often hard or impossible to distinguish from reality. For those who try this drug, they often only do so once. Aside from a wide array of often hyper realistic and terrifying hallucinations, there are also a variety of uncomfortable physical and cognitive effects the drug has to offer.


Despite the negative connotation of the drug, I personally enjoy the use of Diphenhydramine as a psychedelic and to explore psychonautics. Though Benadryl trips are sometimes extremely disorienting and terrifying in the present, looking back on them leaves me with insightful thoughts and experiences.


The following experience I am about to share is a 750 mg diphenhydramine trip one day after classes, my senior year in high school.


Backstory: Frequently in my highschool days, I would shop around for both DXM and DPH as they were legal and I thoroughly enjoyed the trips. This particular trip was 750mg (30 pills) DPH that I had been saving for sometime. At this point I had been experimenting with Benadryl over the span of about four months, with my biggest break between trips being about three weeks.


**5:30 PM / T - 0:00**

The act of ingesting DPH is always a chore for me, as I primarily only purchase the pill form. If you want to access the delusions and hallucinations it has to offer, you need to take higher doses, and higher doses mean more pills. 


After ingesting thirty pills in sequences of five, I couldn't help but feel a bit nervous. Though looking back on my trips greatly intrigues me, and I never necessarily regret it, I will not deny that the peak of large dose trips certainly is scary. Nevertheless, it was what I wanted to do, and I had taken some necessary hard reduction means (grounding tools, pseduo-tripsitters, etc).

**T - 0:45**
Throughout the onset, I chose to relax at my computer, watching videos and listening to music. To me, the effects of DPH are a gradual progression, with full fledged hallucinations never occurring instantaneously. At times I will placebo myself into feeling some physical effects at the trip's early stages, but not this time.


**T - 1:30**

At around the first hour, I got up from my desk to walk around a for a bit in preparation of the trip. Instantaneously I felt the ever-so-familiar perception of body weight increase. It was as if gravity was multiplied tenfold, and weights were barring down on all of my limbs. In addition to an increased sense of mass, my voice began to fail me. I would think I was using my regular voice, but actually be speaking at almost a whisper level. Luckily it was daytime, and a mild temperature, so I went to stand outside for a few minutes before returning to my room


**T - 2:00**

The transition period from the first hour to the second was when my trip began to escalate. Lying in my bed, I would gaze into the perimeter of my room, where the various cobwebs and dust conglomerates began to shake back and forth. It was almost as if wind was circling my room, as the dust contents on my ceiling would twirl and shake around themselves.


Every so often, I would attempt to focus on one of the particulates only to seemingly watch it slide down the walls to meet another cobweb. At times, I would focus onto one and it would appear to sprout small legs and crawl around my room. After refocusing my eyes and blinking, it would return to its state of shaking back and forth in its starting position.

Moving into the second hour was when I saw the first of the many commonly-known Benadryl insects. It manifested itself into the outline of a spider, which quickly crawled across my room and out of site. It looked nothing like any realistic interpretation of a spider, but instead seemed to be the outline of one, with its insides being clear. It's various limbs moved about in spastic motions while traversing my room. At this point, in my opinion, it is hard for anybody to not appear scared in nature. Despite how much I enjoy the experiences, I am always somewhat scared during the trips. I believe this can be attributed to the inherit paranoia and psychosis which accompany high doses of the drug.


**T - 2:00-4:00**
At this point in the trip, my time management skills were not up to par with my sober self. The following are recounts of the trip that I remembering happening, but with no coherent idea of when.


* The common theme of insects was very prevalent. I rarely see flying insects, just manifestations of arachnids that dip and dart throughout my peripherals. Being a man with long hair, at times I piece of hair would brush my skin, and it would send me into an extreme sense of panic as I genuinely believed these insects were crawling on me.


* At various intervals throughout the trip, my dog would walk into my room and up to me. Upon attempting to pet him would result in my hand falling directly through the obviously imaginary canine.


* I stood up and peered into my brothers room. A standup bass that was lying in his bed resembles to me a body with a human skull resting on the chest area.


* In attempts to ground myself, I would try to text friends. This resulted in either complete gibberish or thinking I sent something out. Accompanying these texts, my phone began to seemingly vibrate consistently, making me believe I was receiving text messages.


* Multiple times I sensed my own doom as my heart rate would seemingly increase to a BPM that of 160 - 170.


* Textures (specifically wood-grained) would swirl and contort as I viewed them.


* All lighting in my room appeared dark and sinister.


* Spontaneous tactile sensations would send me into mini convulsions, and I would seemingly seize out multiple times. Though never actually having a seizure, I rapidly convulsed, so take that as you will.


* Complete Libido and Emotion suppression, aside from delirium, psychosis, and paranoia.


**T - 4:00+**

At what I believe was around nine or ten, I attempted to go to sleep. Benadryl is a drug that has the capability of making you extraordinarily tired. This particular time I felt very fatigued and exhausted, but was completely unable to sleep. When attempting to sleep, auditory hallucinations would plague my attempt at rest. I would hear knocking at my window and screams seemingly coming from my back yard. Surprisingly, the act of closing my eyes did not leave my with horrendous internal hallucinations, but instead was a sort of solace from the many unspeakable horrors manifesting themself into external hallucinations.


**After Effects**

I know at some point I eventually fell asleep. I have no recollection of when. When I woke up the next day, I still felt rather confused and had brain fog. The drug itself makes me very apathetic after a trip, which most likely contributes to a feeling of depression and being 'drained'.

"pounded into wet clay
I’m writing this a couple days after to fact in part to carve the experience more deeply into my mind and in part to convince myself that I have not permanently damaged my brain and lost the ability to communicate with language. Here goes nothing…

Though I’d done a considerable amount of psychedelics in college, as a 37 year old I had gotten a bit disconnected from these adventures. Also as a 37 year old, I had begun to sink into a progressively stagnant depression. I struggle with a vast emotional emptiness and an inability to experience joy in the world.

Anyways...

I thought mushrooms might help me and so have been experimenting with them over the last several months since I began cultivating them last October. 

I had a batch of Chitwan that I thought was quite weak, but wasn't sure if I had just overheated them while dehydrating. In order to figure that out I dried a second batch at 120 degrees (took forever....) expecting that this would be a super mellow trip, and that I could write off Chitwan as a ""weak strain.""

I had dramatically underestimated the mushrooms.

I measured out 3.5 grams of dry powder into a small glass of orange juice expecting that at most I might experience a mild high that would make me more fun company for my wife when we take a walk through the neighborhood upon her return.

I felt them coming on within about ten minutes and realized that I had not established an intention for the trip. I pulled out a pad of paper and a pen and wrote myself a note. The primary intention was this: I have lost the passion I had when I was younger, and I would like to reconnect with it.

I felt there must be some ember of passion that is hidden within myself. If I could just find it, then I could protect it, stoke it, fan the flames into something that might power me through to achieve more than I have in my middling life.

I put the note down and went to the living room where I was staring at our potted plants when my wife came home. I briefly explained to her what was going on, made some commentary about how I was experiencing the beauty of things in our home, and then promptly went to bed.

Laying down on the bed I found that when I closed my eyes there was a spinning cartoon gearwork. I found it a bit unpleasant and was about to get up, but then thought to myself that I should just see where this goes. I closed my eyes and settled into bed.

At this point, my wife put on some Nina Simone in the next room while she answered emails on her computer. My god. Nina Simone.

I was loving the beauty of the music, and the pace of it helped to slow the mechanical whirring and spinning. The senseless geometry began to coalesce, and I had the impression of a woman standing at a gate with more whirling clockwork behind it. I had the sense that she was offering me an opportunity to see behind the gate, to go deeper into the experience, but only if I stayed in the darkness of that bed.

Around this time I began to notice back pain creeping up into the experience. I’ve been dealing with various musculoskeletal pain issues for years now. It’s mainly under control, but is something I'm constantly protecting against. A friend who is deep into spiritual journeys had encouraged me to really “go into” my pain when it presents during a trip. So that’s what I did.

It was a bright ribbon of pain in my low back. And I had this sense from the woman gatekeeper that I could surrender this pain up to her if I chose, so that’s what I did.

The pain went away.

Things seemed to be going well, so I figured it was a good time to ask my question to the lady at the gate. How do I reconnect with the passion of my youth?

My pain came back.

I surrendered it to her again. It evaporated away. I asked my question again.

The pain returned.

At this point I had a choice. I could either press through with my intention, or I could surrender it and my pain would stop.

I went deeper into this surrender. As quickly as discomfort could present itself, I would let go of it. No pain could touch me. 

I had this sense that if I continued to let go, to give up, that I could free myself of all the pain that I experienced in my life. Not just the physical pain, but also the emotional pain of my own personal, professional, and financial failures. But this meant that I would have to let go of all the beautiful things in my life as well. All the good things.

I thought of my wife downstairs. I wanted to call out to her and to tell her I loved her. But I knew that if I did then the pain would come back.

The scale of the choice became clear to me. I would have to abandon all future joy to get this pain to go away...it also meant that I would have to abandon my wife. It felt like a betrayal. I was ashamed of my weakness. But I was so tired of the pain of living.

I realized that I was dying. I realized that my death was inevitable, and I absolutely surrendered to it.

I covered my face with my hands, whispered “I give up”, and began weeping. The parts of me that felt pain began to slough off. Peeling back like the layers of an onion. And when that pain went away I had this ecstatic feeling of joy and pleasure. I began to laugh and the pain returned. I surrendered to it again and it sloughed off into carbon and new joy took its place. I found myself crying and laughing at the same time. Whispering over and over and over “I give up. I give up. I give up…”

I felt in that moment that the laughter and the weeping...it was the exact same fucking thing. Which was both heartbreaking and hilarious all at the same time. 

As I continued through with this peeling back and sloughing off I kept waiting to die. I kept waiting for all sensation to end. As more of me was surrendered to the universe I had the sense that the universe and I were composed of the same inert stuff. It was all just clay that had always existed, and always would exist. The life I had lived was just a dance of that clay. A playful illusion because being clay in a timeless void is boring. Everything that had happened or would happen was just the unfolded version of that static stuff.

I called out to my wife who came and lied down beside me.  She held me while I laughed and wept and tried to explain to her what I was experiencing. She began to laugh and weep. At this point I began to re-enter the world, though I was significantly confused.

I used my watch to find that I was an hour and a half into the experience. Time didn’t mean much to me. I'd touched eternity. I took a shower and thought it funny that matter was “cleaning” itself with other matter. I struggled to find underwear and found myself laughing that matter was looking for other matter.

After getting dressed--which took some time--we decided to go for that walk. It was only about 9:30. We strolled through the neighborhood and decided to grab a beer at a local bar. 

I explained the trip as best I could. I noted that I had abandoned her in order to end my suffering and that this was an expression of my own human weakness. I knew that one day I would die, and we would be apart and there was nothing I could do about it. I had accepted this, but still felt I should apologize. She smiled and said she understood.

In recapping it to her, I shared my original intention: to reconnect with the passion of my youth.

I was about to tell her that I ended up not realizing my intention, just had some insight into my own human frailty and came to terms with it.

Then it hit me, and I felt tears welling up again.

I surrendered up to the universe everything that I could. As many layers of the onion as I could offer up, more somehow appeared out of this shining center. It was like I dropped everything I could into the void, but this one thing bounced back.

I realized that what bounced back was the part of me that could feel pain and joy, and create new things. It was that ember I was searching for. 

I had been suffocating it in attachments. Holding on to my old pain, old grievances, old shame. I was root-bound in my soul. I had to surrender up my attachments to find that passion again.

And this meant that “my passion” was not some tool for me to control. Not a spark I take command of and direct to accomplish things in this world. It’s something that I have to listen to, to follow. And if I want to have it, then I have to be willing to experience all kinds of new pain in my life. I have to choose that. And the only way to do that is to let go of my old pain. To surrender to the universe. 

But in the end, it’s not a plea deal. “If I surrender than I will get the passion of my youth.” No man. I surrender because I give up. Because I've already lost. No reward on the other side. I am a piece of wet clay, and one day I will be pounded back into the clay from which I came. 

I cannot fight it. 

I Give Up...

And then the moment I do, there's that spark.

"DMT - baby steps
I recently obtained DMT, and I decided I would do a smaller amount before I went for a brake-through; so here is what happened with my first encounter. 

I had trouble actually obtaining DMT and then once I got I was honestly really nervous; not mentally but physically. My heart was pounding so I took a bath and then got out and layed against the wall with some pillows. 

11:05 PM - (Let me state that I have DMT in e-juice form and was informed it takes around 3-4 good hits of for a powerful experience). I took an insanely large hit and held it in until It made me cough. 

T + 10 Seconds - Within 10 seconds I felt an instant wave of euphoria go all over like a wave throughout my being 

T+ 15 Seconds - I take a large second hit and and the best way I can describe what happened is; I started having visuals very much like an extremely high dose of LSD(Comparative to a 1400ug trip in the past) 

T + 45 Seconds - At this point I decide to take one more hit, it wasn't that large as the whole room was very overwhelming

After this third hit I saw diamond patterns over existence, everything seemed to melt to the floor and shatter when they hit it. Soon I was focusing on what seemed to be a portal and I had this urge to close my eyes. I saw a being rip open a hole and I didn't jump inside but I could see these insane colors; none like I had ever seen before in these odd patterns swirling everywhere. At this point I was not thinking. I quickly though ""Let me take one more hit to jump into that portal!"" but by the time I had opened my eyes it had been 15 minutes and I realized it was too late. 

After I opened my eyes I got an insanely weird feeling... nothing seemed real. Everything was fake. I looked in the mirror and I felt fake. 

Tonight I will be attempting to jump into the rabbit whole by hitting it until I can't anymore. 

To anyone that has anxiety about DMT like me, let me say; you will be fine.

"Mushrooms 4.6g - It is what it is
Intro: I already experienced Ego death once before. Over a year ago, and I have not taken shrooms since then. Ego death then was pretty much out of my control, after that it seemed like a wonderful dream. And I remember forgetting how to be human. Like it's a constant activity. It was a rather positive experience. 

This time I took it with the idea of working on some personal problems (mistake taking a large dose for that), so I was trying to be conscious. I took the dose over the period od 60-90min, and I think that made a big difference. 

It started slowly, and then it speed up really fast. I remember a feeling that I could influence reality, but deep inside I had this feeling that there is no point of actually changing anything. It is what it is. 

Then I started losing it, everything started bending, and I was one. One with everything. And all of my personal problems seemed so trivial, not worthy of pondering over.

Next was a feeling that I was about to disintegrate, like physically. My nose started bleeding, and I could taste the blood in my mouth (afterward it turned out I was not actually bleeding). I had a feeling that my eye is moved, my teeth felt weird, like I was melting. This is me surrendering to the energy. It was not scary, it just was. 

The reality was like an illusion, a meaningless mirage I was creating. And I was trying to think of our history, progress, as a species, as a planet, I was trying to grasp on something 'objective' that is viewed as great progress. But even that was not enough. Everything seemed like an illusion. 

At one moment a thought of jumping thru the window came to my mind. But the action to do that was unnecessary. It would not change anything. There is nothing to jump to. 

Again I started forgetting how to be human. Again that feeling like that is something I do over and over and over again. And it seemed pointless to returning to being a human. I was everything. I was my room, my building, my friends, my family, my loved ones. To what to return, when I am everything. 

But still, probably because I took the dose gradually, I first had this feeling that this is it. This is the step before you release yourself to that infinite energy. When the experience is too abstract to be comprehended. It felt like a step before disintegrating into the energy. 

I had these moments when I remembered: You took shrooms. This is just a trip. In 2 hours everything will return to 'normal', and you will be the same person with his problems, wishes, desires, goals. Just stay safe.

And that was the only thing I felt I had no control over. Time. I knew time will pass, and once again I will be in this body.

I realized that I needed someone besides myself. I didn't want to let go. Now when I look back to it, I am not sure why I didn't let to. I kept repeating ""You have to go back. You want to be human. You have something to get back to"". 

I went to take a shower. I took all my clothes off, put hot water, then cold water, and it was so meaningless. I was the water, I was the shower. It was all me. 

I called a friend, asked her to come over. I told her what has happened, and that I can't make a difference between her and me and this table and this room. And that I just need an anchor to reality.

And then I just talked to her. At the start, I would just stop talking, because she was I and I was her, we were one. To whom was I talking then.

I am not very close to her in some traditional meaning. But it was such intimate experience. I was realizing at that moment how crazy everything sounded while I talked to her. Because everything was getting lost in the translation. First when I translated it into my words, then when she translated my words into her thoughts.
I still had a grasp that I took shrooms, and I explained that I do realize that my behavior right now will seem crazy to her, and it will seem weird to me in a couple of ours, and that next time we will be laughing over this.  

After awhile I felt slowly like chains (this sounds too dramatical) of existing was falling down on me. All the physical and psychical barriers limiting that endless energy. After 2 hours of talking, and maybe 5h of tripping, I was myself again. I started feeling my body and feeling usually. I took a shower and I was so relaxed. I was totally sober, and I tried going to sleep but I could not because, in fact, I was not tired. I slept for 5 hours, and now I am good as new. 

Before when I was taking shrooms, it needed me 1 extra day to process the experience. But today it is not like this. 

Thank you for reading.

"MoonMan Trip Report
After getting hold of some freebase DMT we were pretty eager to try it out. We didn't really have the right equipment at the time and made the mistake of taking the whole lot in one hit. I immediately went into shock and couldn't breath properly for a solid ten minutes (it probably didn't help that I currently have a chest infection and I would not recommend this method at all).

Within seconds I began to trip... Hard.

I found myself in above a launch pad in a towering rocket. Although there was space for others I was, at first, alone.

I quickly took off and found myself drifting away from Earth toward the Moon, as I floated away from Earth, by this time no wider than a thumb in my field of view.

Passing the Moon, I stepped into my spacesuit and left the craft. From there I floated outward, tethered by a thin cable, but otherwise free to drift into the dark night - completely in awe of all I saw below me.

The Moon was a blue-ish-silver in colour and I could swear it shimmered, though that may have just been a reflection from the inside of my helmet.

Upon returning to my ship, the music sent me spinning, I drifted wholly weightless, through the airlock. Around me were an array of instruments and shiny white surfaces. As I floated into the central area of the capsule my friends were revealed, all having taken their place in the chairs beside mine.

I could feel my many companions; all of their ecstasy and happiness.

By this time we had long since passed the Moon, the Earth was no longer visible, but ahead lay a small red dot. Before I knew it we were descending through the Martian atmosphere, the red planet growing infinitely large in my field of view.

Fifty feet from the ground I waved goodbye to my friends and left my body, below me I could see the others, only now they moved like ants, as though I were watching a timelapse.

I wanted to stay, to walk on the surface and be with my friends - I hand't realised the lofty heights of my final destination.

Having left my body it was now possible to travel not only in space, but in time. The desire to stay dissolved away - I accepted the inviting hand that beckoned from the empty darkness of space.

Before I could react I was flung to the outer reaches of the solar system. Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto passed by successively faster, time accelerating all the while.

I basked in all the glory of the cosmos, every awesome star, galaxy and nebula; simultaneously seeing it all and yet nothing as all was lost on such a vast scale.

My attention was drawn to a small planet in a solar system infinitely far from Earth, my bodiless mind drifted down and below me I saw an entire civilisation, we had left our home and begun to populate the universe.

Yet I couldn't say 'we' because, without a body, I was not human.

Epochs passed and humankind spread out farther still, covering every corner of the universe, thriving adapting and evolving all the while. Before long, new species began to evolve and soon after that the beings which populated the universe hardly resembled humans at all.

There were all variety of exotic species, and billions of years had passed since I had last seen Earth. I travelled back to the planet I was called home. So much time had passed that I hardly recognised  it.

Before me I saw everything, the entire history of existence from the prebiotic soup of organic molecules, to the very end of time and everything in between; all simultaneously shown, unconcerned by the existence of time.

The time I had come from appeared as a minuscule dot, almost indistinguishable from the beginning of time. So early in story had I come from, and how blind I had been because of that.",Addicted
"LSD Trip Transcript (Actual Thoughts during a trip)
",
"My First LSD Experience - discovering the liquid paradise of pure ecstasy.
It all happened at a 3 day music festival. It was our second day and I was pretty tired from the previous night’s MDMA, alcohol and doobie sessions. I was pretty stoned right before I decided to take it, my heart jumped a tiny bit when I got offered a tab. I don’t remember the exact dosage of it, for I was pretty ignorant, and still probably am, but I thought – “Fuck it, once in a lifetime, hey?”  I did not really know anything about Acid, or even what the effects would be. To be honest I did not even know Acid was slang for LSD, or that these small sheets were dipped in the liquid chemical that is LSD. I thought the tabs were a solid form of the dug. I had succumbed to group pressure. I did not mind though, all of us were pretty close, and I don’t even think the “main mac” of our group has ever taken LSD in any large dose, because he later said he never experienced any sort of visuals, or hallucinations before, neither did he that night. As we all stood in a circle, me and one of my friends each took a full tab. The other two (main mac and his disciple) split theirs in two, and had only half a tab. 

It was 6pm and directly after each of us dropped we proceeded from our camping ground to the stage where a band I liked was playing. I noticed some slight changes in my senses. I felt slightly drunk as the band kept playing. The “crew” I dropped with disappeared, and I was all by myself. 

Luckily I saw one of my good college buddies and his girlfriend and rejoiced with delight upon seeing them.

“What'sup!?” we exclaimed in laughter and surprise, fist bumped and hugged.

“Shit, so glad I found you guys!” I laughed.

About 20 minutes passed when the band finished.  Together the three of us walked towards the “Redbull Trance Stage”. It sat at the bottom of a very steep hill that was scattered with small to large rocks with a few acacia trees here and there and absolutely packed with people encapsulated in ecstatic dance. The stage was big, square, blue and red, and colours from the whole spectrum shot out from lasers and lights illuminating the otherwise completely dark surroundings. Large black speakers bellowed the deep, melodic house tunes. The DJ stood like a god orchestrating the whole crowd’s movements and vibes.

At first we sat at the very top of the hill. Again I was reunited with past friends long since seen. Again I was delighted of finding some grip in reality. They decided to smoke a joint. I unbeknownst chimed in on the toking. At this point the strangeness of the high started setting in. My limbs and hands felt watery. It felt like I was sweating, but I wasn’t hot at all. I noticed the link between thinking and speaking started to blur. My voice sounded clear and melodic. As I was sitting I looked at a friend, and he smiled at me. His smile seemed to go from one ear to the other and his whole face looked extremely thin and sharp, quite demonic, I thought. I was still in control at this moment, so I knew it was only the drug, although I was a bit terrified. 

“I just took some acid” 

(Whoa, what’s up with my voice? Why the fuck is he smiling at me like that?)

“Really? Nice man! Have you done it before?”

“Yeah, like three times” I lied. 

“Haha, awesome dude” His overwhelming glance and smile glaring back at me.

(Just the drugs…Just the drugs)

Another friend came into the conversation and stood above me. He lost a lot of weight recently. As he stood over me, his whole body seemed to extend far into the air. His face even more twisted, sharpened and strangely silky.

(Just…the…drugs…)

I decided to go with it.

“You look different man!”

“Thanks dude”

“No, no…Not a compliment…I mean, you look really strange” 

Laughter. 

I felt good. 

I like dancing. At the thought of this I immediately jumped up and convinced everyone to join me at the very front of the stage. My friend’s girl gave me a cigarette.

(My anchor...) 

I was convinced they all knew that I was on some heavy shit…I was convinced they were as well. As I was making my way down the very unstable hill, I noticed my legs felt spaghetti-like stretching what seemed like meters in front of me.  I took a drag. 

The cigarette seemed extremely silky in texture, long and beautiful. The smoke looked alive and beating.

We pushed ourselves to the front.

Before this moment, I have not really paid attention to the music. Suddenly I heard sounds I have never before heard. Strange, heavenly beats emulated from an unknown source.

Usually, it took effort in order to even listen to a song but now - not only was I listening very clearly and very naturally – I was feeling, seeing the music. It had an undefinable amount of dimensions. It felt unreal yet so natural – as if it was meant to be listened to in this way, as if it was written for me - for this moment. 

The DJ had complete control of me. With every bass drop he pulled me apart and rearranged me. I was taller than everyone, I started to become part of the sound waves, I would retract, become normal again. It was amazing. I was dancing. I made jokes. “I’m a fucking rainbow!” I would tell people around me, and they would laugh, and someone would ask “What the hell did YOU take?”, and I would say “Mmmustard Sauce” and giggle, and they would giggle. 

Eventually the DJ’s session was over. I started walking towards the next stage alone. Upon my arrival I noticed an abnormal silence throughout the whole venue broken only by what seemed to be gentle chimes and distant whistles coming from the next stage. I felt like I was in some other fantastical, ancient place filled with magic. Everything everywhere was covered in luminous silk, beautiful and engaging - everything flowed and breathed.

Now I could only see a few people in the landscape of the festival. It felt like everyone I saw was on the same high as me, tripping we found each other in this wondrous realm of an alternate reality. 

An afro wearing white dude was laying down some intense riffs on his guitar. He would say things about our world we are now in - how this is what we have come here to do, to have fun, to have pleasure. As I stood by myself to the side of the stage the music was flowing through me. Whereas the trance had pulled me apart, it seemed as if I was elevated by the melodic indie sounds. My body would flow with each strum, far up into the skies - I became air, water, fire, earth.

I was dancing beautifully, enchantingly. Others joined around me. 

I opened my eyes. I and everything around me was the most clear, most beautiful liquid gold. At once I felt as if I was in the most mature world possible. Everything was brighter than I ever could have imagined! 

(Holy shit, holy shit, this is the real world! I know! I am! Why has this been kept a secret from me!? For so long?)

I became sad for a moment pondering the thought of being left out. 

(How could my parents have kept me out of this? My friends? Did they know? Was this their way of telling me? At a music festival? Was my whole life leading up to this moment? Am I graduating life!?)

All my worries, fears, beliefs and everything I thought I knew about the world flew straight out of my mind.

A tremendous amount of pleasure and confidence overcame me as I continued dancing in the pure ecstatic revelations of my mind. I was merging, sexually with everything and everyone around me. I was having overwhelmingly, extremely orgasmic, other worldly sex in some strange golden, colourful, extremely vivid liquid state with the whole spectrum of the universe, every organism, everything was alive and making love! 

I was being worshipped, thanked and praised in orgasmic, drawn out moans of absolute pleasure by the most beautiful creatures I have ever seen and I was the most beautiful thing that has ever existed!I and everyone were in our purest states of being. 

(I'm in heaven! I'm God! I always knew this! How could I have forgotten! I created all of this for me! Just for me! Oh...God! I'm everyone, everything! Me, an average man-child of 21 years of age! Me, from a boring town, a boring life! It was me! Only me! Thank you! Thank you!)

There are no words to describe the ultimate pleasure and love for myself, others and everything I felt at that moment. 

At the end of the climax I receded in solitude towards the back of the stage. I lied down slowly on the soft, smooth grass in tremendous relief and satisfaction. A few of the girls from our heavenly orgy came and stood over me. They smiled down and asked if I was all right.

“Yes…” I said smiling contently.

""I just wish someone would skip this shitty music"" I joked.

They laughed and smiled back.

I closed my eyes.

What happened next cannot be described in words but some images remain:

As if going through an endless row of doorways I was shown kindly, by everyone I had ever known, the true reality of the world. My guides were older, younger, different looking versions of me at different times of my eternal life - they knew everything I was, everything I am and everything I was to become - they accepted me unconditionally with the most tremendous amount of love. 

I was shown where all began and all ended. It was shown clearer now that I, everyone and everything in the whole universe was god - in the most selfish, pleasurable, guilt free way imaginable - times infinity. Further than what our earthly bound minds could possibly comprehend.

(I always knew. I always knew! I just had to remember! Oh, how could I have forgotten!)

I was embraced, lifted in celebratory applause and wonderful grace as the crescendo of the most beautiful music ever constructed chimed in crystal clarity throughout all of the universe. 

I was elevated far into the sky, the stars and the galaxy - far above myself, our world and all existence.

"First time with any psychedelic: LSD Trip Report! (Long)
This is a trip report from the first time I took any type of psychedelic other than weed and any other ""drug"" other than alcohol, weed, and DPH. Sorry for it being so long, it's mainly for me to look back on and something to link to my friends that are always asking what all LSD and psychedelics are like. But for anyone else who may want to read, here it is!

Note that what I had was not real LSD like I was told it was from who I bought it from. It was some type of RC that I unfortunately can't identify.

**Pre-Trip**
I had been wanting to get my hands on some LSD or shrooms for a year now but couldn't find anyone who could get me any. Finally, I meet someone who tells me he can get me a tab of LSD next week. Next week comes and we meet up. He tells me that it's double dabbed LSD with a drop on each side instead of just one. At first i'm having my doubts about buying it just because there's no way of telling if it's actually real or just a little piece of paper. After a while of contemplating, I decide to go ahead and buy it from him for $20.

**Pre-Trip Extended**
I then went back home and planned to trip later that night since it was Friday and I had nothing to do for the next 24 hours. I call my friend over and ask him to be my sitter, he agrees and arrives at around 4:30PM with 0.5 grams of dank Headband he brought with him. We chill out and smoke the .5 out of my pipe. I only take 1 or 2 small hits and let him have the rest because I want to be sober before I drop the acid which I planned to drop at 6:00PM (in about an hour and 30 minutes). Also, I was the only one who was going to be tripping and I didn't want him to feel bad because he was sober and I was going to be tripping. 

**Lucy Drop**
So 6:00PM rolls around and my high is pretty much gone. I'm only a [3] while my friend is still at a [6]. I take the acid and keep it under my tongue to see if I can identify it as real LSD or some kind of research chemical. Like I suspected, it's not real. I can tell because it has a bitter, metallic taste to it and it also begins to numb my tongue and gums after a while. I'm not very disappointed because I know it's still going to make me trip. It was some kind of other research chemical, likely NBOMe or DOx. I keep the small blank white tab under my tongue for another 15 minutes before I swallow it, knowing that's probably the only way for it to work since it's not real LSD.

**1st Hour**
I sit and wait in my room for the effects to kick in. I turn on my black light and some orange rope lights I have to make the trip even more fun. I also light a candle and burn some incense and play a playlist I had made just for the day I trip on acid. An hour goes by with no noticeable effects. Me and my friend are just sitting down, chilling, listening to music. Then all of a sudden out of the blue I just bust out laughing for no reason. One second everything is normal and the next i'm laughing hysterically for no reason what so ever and I can't stop myself. My friend starts laughing too and asks what's so funny. Unable to talk, I continue laughing harder than I ever have, unable to stop for literally the next 5 minutes. It started becoming a struggle to breathe after a while that's how hard I was laughing. Finally when I calm down my friend asks again ""lol what was so funny?"". I replied with ""I don't know... I couldn't control myself there for a second"". After this I feel like i'm definitely starting to come up. I'm starting to feel very euphoric and happy as I begin to smile and giggle at everything. My senses are also becoming more and more enhanced, especially my sense of hearing. Pink Floyd sounds fucking amazing.

**1st Hour + 30 Minutes**
About an hour and 30 minutes into the trip I begin seeing faint OEV's. Everything is starting to become wavy and looks like it's breathing. Brighter objects like the computer monitor, lights, the TV, anything giving off light basically, is even more wavy and noticeable. I go to the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror to see if my pupils were dilated. I at first thought that these effects were just placebo so I wanted to make sure I was actually tripping. Sure enough, my pupils are saucers. That was really cool to me, seeing how big my pupils were. When I walk back into my room which is all set up to have a trippy atmosphere, it blows my mind. Seeing all the lights I had turned on and the music that was playing was amazing to me. 

**2nd Hour**
Around the 2nd hour is when things start getting confusing. By now, the effects are pretty obvious and hard to ignore where as before I would question if I was actually tripping or if it was just placebo. The most obvious OEV is the wavy effect everything has. [http://i.imgur.com/6h3wq.jpg](LIKETHIS) but not as intense. Normal still objects would appear to be calmly moving or breathing. My desktop wallpaper looked animated, even though it was just a still picture. I'm also becoming more and more euphoric as time progresses but along with the building euphoria, is the building confusion. I would get up to do something, but halfway through I would stop and forget what I was doing and I'd go off to do something else. Then, i'd remember again only to forget as I attempt to complete the task again. I would also frequently pause the music, get up from my seat and just go ""wait a minute..."" and stand there for a second before sitting back down and resume the music again. I did this probably 10 or 20 times through out the trip. Creative and intense thoughts began racing through my head and it would become too overwhelming at points so I would stop the music to try and take a break from the intensity of the trip. I would also stop everything to try and complete my thoughts. Like I said, I had hundreds of intense creative ideas running through my head at a time so it was very overwhelming. I would think of a brilliant idea, stop the music and run for a piece of paper to write the idea down as quick as possible before another brilliant idea popped in my head. I'd also think of how awesome it would be to do one thing, but then think of how awesome it would be to do another. For example I would think ""Wow! How amazing would it be to go outside?!"" and i'd go outside only to stand there for a second before thinking ""Wow! How amazing would it be to play some call of duty?"" I'd then put in the disk to play the game but before even getting into a game i'd think of something else that would be more amazing to do. I kept falling into these loops of confusion, not knowing what to do because there is just so much to do in such little time! ...I guess was my perspective. I wanted to experience so much for the short time I was going to be tripping on acid, that I couldn't get through the experiences fast enough.

**3rd Hour - 1st Peak**
These loops continued until the 3rd hour when I just decided to stop thinking so much and enjoy the trip. I'd say the peak began around this time (3rd hour) and lasted until the 4th hour. By now, OEV's are very strong. I realize that i'm probably peaking now not only becauase of how intense the OEV's were, but also because of how euphoric I was. Everything was so intense that I couldn't use the computer. When typing, I would look down at my hands and see purple and green [http://i.imgur.com/pDY6S.jpg](tracers) while moving my fingers to type. The letters on the keyboard were also glowing bright purple. I would get so lost in the colors and tracers I was seeing while typing, that I forgot what I was typing in the first place. This is what made using the computer difficult, because whenever I would look at the computer screen I would become hypnotized by the visuals I was seeing. Then, all of a sudden a massive wave of energy rushed over me. I suddenly became extremely energetic and excited and I jump out of my chair to play with my dog which was so fun. I was running around playing with him all through out my house for the next hour laughing because of how euphoric I was. My friend later told me afterwards that I was acting like I was on coke because of how excited and energetic I was during this time.

**4th Hour**
The 4th hour approaches and my friend expresses his boredom. He lost his high a couple hours ago and tells me he doesn't want to be sober. I guess after seeing how much fun I was having, he wanted to have fun too. I have $60 so I decide to call my dealer to buy some trees. He lets me know he's available, so we decide to go to his house and buy some. He lives just 2 neighborhoods away up the street so we decide to just walk there. I also wanted to walk so I could enjoy the nice cool breezy night. The walk to my dealers house was interesting. I feel like I started coming down from the trip once I started walking. Like I said, brighter objects and colors would be more noticeable so walking outside in the darkness made it difficult to see the OEV's I was seeing in my brightly lit room. While walking, I look in someone's yard and see some strange object standing up in the middle of the yard. It's hard to see at first but after staring at it for a a while I determine it's a fan. It looked like one of those tall white fans that was turning left and right on it's own. I kept staring at it for a while because it didn't make sense. How could a fan be on and running in the middle of someone's yard where there's no socket or wall for it to be plugged into? So I stop walking to try and focus on it and realize that it was a lawn mower. 

**5th Hour**
We get to my dealers house. My friend waits outside while I go in. He leads me to the garage where everything is smoky and hazy. Everything is so foggy that I could barely see my hand when I held it up in front of me. He keeps walking through the garage and I almost loose him in the smoke but he comes back and hands me a fat bag and says ""that's 5 grams of some good ass OG Kush"". My dealer usually sells a gram for $20 so I was confused at first and told him that I only had $60, enough for 3 grams. He then tells me I can have all 5 for $60 since he fucks with me. 

**6th Hour**
We get back to the house at around midnight, 6 hours after dropping the RC. The effects are fading away, and the trip is no where near as intense as it was the first 4 hours. Iv'e always heard people warn not to smoke weed on LSD unless you're experienced because it will make things wayyy more intense. But my friend wanted to get high, and I couldn't turn down a toke. Besides, I was coming down pretty fast, so it wasn't like I was smoking at the peak. Still, I decide to play it slow. I only load up 0.3 grams into the bowl at first and me and my friend blow it down pretty fast so I go ahead and load another 0.5 grams into the bowl. We take turns passing the bowl and he gives it back to me to kill off the last little bit there was. I spark the lighter and move it towards the weed but stop before I light it. I stop to stare at the flame of the lighter. ""Woahhh. Blue fire all the way!"". The flame of the lighter was a light, azure blue color that began turning into a dark royal blue color as I continued to stare at it. It was mesmerizing as it began to turn [http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1DPu1cjT4rM/TfYb43ssuaI/AAAAAAAAADA/pW8YxrNijmg/s1600/ColourReplacement-lighter.jpg](purple), then yellow, and then back to blue again. I put the flame up to the weed as i'm holding the bowl up to my mouth with one hand, and sparking the weed with the lighter in the other. 

**7th Hour - 2nd Peak**
I inhale... Hold it for 5 seconds... Then exhale. The moment I begin exhaling everything starts slowly vibrating. Then the vibrations turn into the wavy, breathing effect everything had ealier, but it's now way more intense. The weed instantly propels the trip back into an intense peak, even more intense than the first peak. Colors begin [http://i.imgur.com/wcYKq.gif](changing) and distorting and everything becomes brighter and more vivid. With music blaring, me and my friend are just sitting there laughing at random shit enjoying ourselves (me more so than him lol). Then my walls which are white started changing colors. They changed to yellow, then orange, and then red. Green and purple tracers were also coming off anything moving. It become so intense there was a moment where I felt like I briefly blacked out and was unconsciouss, like I briefly fell into a deep dream state. I was sitting there and I started drifting off into a whole different reality. I don't remember it very clearly but I just remember snapping back into reality and saying ""damn... I lost all sense of reality there for a second."" which I did. Just then the LSD playlist I had made ended so me and my friend decide to watch The Sopranos. Not even 10 minutes in the show my friend is asleep (that's what OG Kush will do!). I wake him up and tell him he can go sleep on my bed and that i'll take the couch because I wanted to stay up and enjoy my trip. Watching The Sopranos for the rest of the night was a trip. The characters faces were constantly morphing and it was hard to identify them. Their facial features would morph exactly like [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZurRt0TidI](this) but faster and smoother and it didn't look as obvious and they'd go from looking normal to looking like a completely different person. Tony's eyes (Tony is the main character) and mouth were also abnormally [http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/307/761/f6c.jpg](small), but no one else's, just his it was weird. I eventually fell asleep (still very much tripping) in the middle of the second episode of which ever season it was. It was around 3:00am when I fell asleep so I was around 9 hours in.

It was a very fun first trip with no negatives at all except I felt sore all next day which was probably because of how much I was running and jumping around. Other than that, it was one of the best experiences of my life.

"Trip Report: Psilocin 40mg
This is an unconventional report.

For those wondering, the compound was synthesized by a trusted third party.

Experience Time Line: The main effects lasted a total of 9 hours, while they peaked around hour 3-4  the Come up before visuals started was just less than an hour. Mental state was clear until 1.5 hours into the experience when the visuals developed further only to spring to life the un-natural world inside my home. It might be described as riding a single very large wave and turning out the backside moments before it crashes on the shoreline -if you are familiar with surfing. If you are familiar with psychedelic mushrooms then you know that the mushroom experience comes in waves -building and receding in strength, only to swell to a new heights during the next wave.

Details: Music kick-started the experience, but was quickly removed because of extreme peace followed by rushes of paranoia. The music is called ""Are you shpongled"" by Shpongle. It is a perfect complement to the mushroom state. Come-up was extremely quick, an ever intensifying wave of emotion and psychedelia persisted until my mental state was broken down to that of a child -innocent and incapable of truly anything- yet the fundamental instincts of survival remained embedded in the imagery that would present itself later in the evening. The visuals could be described as fun and mushroom-like until the peak of the experience when they began to take a new form. The visuals now held meaning and represented some memory long forgotten of a world forged in respect for earth and her plants. An out-of-body experience occurred during the peak of effects, it had lasted, (perhaps, but no way to really tell) 5 minutes, during which time my body started to shut down. It did not believe it had reason to remain functioning as it did not detect a spirit within. in effect, I witnessed myself --dying right before my eyes. An experience I don't particularly want to repeat, but will not be forgotten. During the time I spent outside of my body I (tried to) speak to entities that revealed themselves to me. The entities I spoke with did not speak english or any language that I recognized as modern. I remember saying ""I don't know what you are, but can we be friends?"". It was so amazingly strange for myself, I usually can keep grounded even in the most intense of situations.

Summary: It was absolutely amazing, but on the next adventure I will stick to the Shulgin recommended doses. Nearly doubling the highest recommended dose made for an extremely intense experience. Although more intense than those experiences included in Tihkal, it fits the description of effects down to the word. Insights into side effects related to higher does: During the beginning part of the experience no bruxism was noted where it usually occurs, but my body was clearly shaking (almost seizing level)   from the new found energy that is common for me during high doses of any psychedelic substance. Heart rate was elevated more than I would have liked, but that is effectively normal in any dose.

After Thoughts A recurring visual hallucination and something I remembering seeing when out of body... Also rabbits are very sensitive to psychedelics when compared to rats and humans. I was noting that I am much more sensitive to mind altering effects than most people. It was, the rabbit, I think very related to my mind set previous to the experience. I rarely remember to close my eyes while I trip, which means that all my previous reports described oevs  (possibly otherwise, but not likely) It is a very stimulating experience until the peak is over when the body begins to relax as soon as the mind allows.",Addicted
"First time lsd
So I’m young don’t wanna say how young and I first tripped on lsd about a month ago in a place called Corfu in Greece with some very close friends. I didn’t really know what to expect I’d done mushrooms before like 11 times I think. I was very nervous and started only with a quarter tab I think 55mg. About 30 minutes pass and a feel the effects in my body but not really any visuals, that’s what I wanted most out of it so I took another 55mg that’s when things got really visual. Where we were was a secluded beach that you need to climb down too about a half hour. We were sitting in little wooden huts on the beach and as I look out into the sea the sky turns rainbow and starts moving like a and breathing. Every tree shrub and plant was dancing to along with the music and boulders on the beach had little rainbows orbiting them. It was so dope, at first I was nervous to climb back up but as I did I felt amazing. I felt a sense of accomplishment that I’ve never felt before almost like overcoming a fear as I do have a slight fear of heights.

"18 years of saving my life, 1 day at a time.
18 years ago today I walked into a room of recovery. There was a man sitting at a table, doing some paper work. I told him why I was there and he proceeded to to share with me his experience with alcohol. He gave me a list of 20 questions and told me to answer them to myself....said he did not need to know what my answers were. After glancing over them, it looked like I was in the right place.
I have not had a drink of alcohol from that day. What I have done is participated in a set system of directions that has helped me to form a new way of thinking...I changed my mind about some things. When I was able to change my mind, I became able to change my behaviors......imagine that.
There are to many people to thank. Many more have now passed away. Many are just lost to time and distance. No matter where they are, I will tell you that I did not recover from a trashed out liver and a hopeless state of mind without them. 
I humbly asked God to remove my obsession for alcohol. I tell you that God answered that prayer. I am a walking miracle. I also tell you that he used recovering drunks and drug addicts as the tools to save me. He even used some that had to die to get clean. 

This post is dedicated to those who have carried me until I could walk, and then helped me to trudge the path of happy destiny. For you I am grateful.

I finally reached the half-year mark. Haven't been sober for that long ever since I began using. The intriguing part of this is that I had an extremely vivid using dream this morning. In it, I had relapsed right before reaching my 6 month mark and chose to keep it a secret even from my sponsor and even picked up the chip knowing I didn't deserve it. I continued working the program but kept using occasionally until i returned to my full blown addict lifestyle while still keeping the whole thing under wraps, afraid of what would happen if others had found it I was a sham. It was so realistic that I woke up terrified, thinking I had legitimately relapsed only to realize that it was all just a dream after a good 15 seconds. Then it came to me that today's my 180th day clean and I felt rejuvenated. Can't help but think that there was some sort of significance to that dream, some sort of message from my Higher Power that I can't comprehend very well.

"3 years sober today
Today I have 3 years sober. 3 years ago I was drinking alone watching a movie (Unguarded - Chris Herren Story) which changed my life. In that movie a man was living selfishly through drugs, alcohol, women, etc. At one point he was passed out with homeless men, I said (to the TV), “That’s pathetic”, then I paused and said “Oh wait, that’s you Justin”. A feeling of disgrace came through my body at 2am, I cried from shame, but then a feeling of relief and joy because I told myself “You don’t have to live like that anymore”. I haven’t had a drink since.
From that day, I decided to become the man I admire. It’s been hard work, very hard, but the old me had to die for the new one to live. Some of you know my journey and I’ll tell you from day 1 in sobriety it has been therapy (to fix the issues that caused the drinking), being around other sober and positive folk (people, places, things), volunteering (my humility led me to give back), mentoring (giving one on one yields the best gratitude). From the 1st day I created my own rules and I do not negotiate the integrity of that ethos. I don’t go to bars, because I don’t belong there...it's simply not interesting to me.
3 years later what do I have? An amazing wife (before I was incapable of love or being loved), 2 amazing twin daughters (I can give them the love I never received growing up). My financial status is great (before I was borrowing money to support my habits)- I’m now closing on a new beautiful house next month for my family (when I was drinking I sometimes lived in a garage). Also in 3 years, I’ve learned a language, become a published author, been syndicated as a writer, dedicated myself to boxing, over 300 volunteer/mentoring efforts, and most importantly held my head high and proud of the man I see in the mirror (my drinking helped with self-worth, social anxiety, and many things that related to me not accepting me - that's because I didn't like who I was).
If you felt humility through this thread, that’s’ because it’s there, and I feel it every day. I changed my behavior that changed my life. The life I have now is way better than the life I had before, therefore my old ways are simply not interesting to me at all…and I think that is the secret to change/recovery…create a better life than the one you had. My life is simple, I do only a few things, but I do those things exceptionally. Some might believe addiction is a disease, but I believe the mind is powerful enough to re-wire and learn new behaviors if one is willing to put in the work - this is because I believe in the essence of the human spirit and our capacity to be amazing people. You are amazing, did you know that? If not, read this thread again. The chill you feel in your body is your potential..follow that, it's honest, it will guide you correctly.
Share this with anyone who might feel inspired to become their better self. Today is my “re-birth day” I'm not perfect, but i'm perfect for the people I'm meant for...and they love that I'm recovered....one day at a time.

"this disease talks to you in your own voice
hi guys i don't know if i've ever made a topic here but my sober date is 12/19/12 and life has been pretty decent since.

i spent some time with my friend who had been sober a month or two before me but relapsed last month and has been struggling since. tonight he called me. said he used today. agreed to meet him for coffee. on the phone he said he was considering going to a long term treatment. 

we get to talking and all i hear are the reasons why he cant go, 'what he'll lose' and all of this stuff. it's easy to sympathize with but i had to remember, this is the disease talking. this is the disease trying to keep this guy right where he is, trying to keep him stuck from taking action. trying to keep him in his thoughts to figure this thing out. 

we hear so many slogans and cute little catch phrases and over time i learn what they truly mean.

the disease talks to us and to others in our own voice. it tells us all the sound logical reasons why we cant. it tells us how we're going to figure this out and be ok. it tells us that goddamn lie that we can still go on doing what we've been doing. 

for the longest time i didn't have an experience as an aware observer of this. eye opening for me and just wanted to share that. when my friends go back out and when i lose others i get really fired up. so there.",Recovered

"7 years sober, and I'm sick and tired of AA
Anyone else get like this? I've been through the 12 steps and have sponsored a few people, but something is definitely wrong with my life right now and AA/the program just doesn't seem to give me any juice anymore. I'm actually hating going to meetings and if I reach to my friends and sponsor, I just get the same old cliche fucking responses that are driving me up the wall. I honestly think I'm depressed and need some outside therapy - I recognize that AA is a way of getting me away from drinking and is not a cure-all. Is it terrible if i just take a break from it and focus my life on recovery from depression? Fuck.

EDIT: thanks for all the help everyone, I'm going to seek out a therapist for sure. furthermore I'm going to start getting a few other things in my life that are lacking...like a new creative endeavor, some traveling, and some other spiritual practices that I've been watching help others (there's a few meditation/buddhist groups in my area, and I know some AA peoples that get a lot out of attending that stuff).

""How waffles help me understand """"god""""
When I first started recovery I realized that I could not understand god, and I did not need to. Here is how I understand today.

Assume for a minute that something created me, cares for me, loves me, and has a plan for me. These are the characteristics of a higher power implicit in the 12 Steps, right? """"power greater than myself"""", """"care of god"""", """"god's will for us"""", that sort of thing, right?

While I was using I thought I was the center of the universe, so the next bit of this thought experiment came pretty easy. What would it be like to **be** a Higher Power? I know, I can make waffles. I love waffles. I have a plan for waffles. Heck, they can help me carry out my plan, right? OK, so I am my waffle's higher power.

Do waffles understand me? Nope. Do they need to? Nope. They just have to be waffles. 

And from my perspective it is a good deal. I get yummy waffles that fuel me all morning, giving me the power to do good, or whatever. 

From the waffle's point of view though, it kind of sucks. To the waffle this """"higher power"""" is going to chew him up and use him and in the end he is just poop. 

So, do I, as god's waffle, focus on the fact that I am dying a little bit every day, that life is hard and painful, and just not fair? Or do I rejoice in the fact that I get to be covered in sweetness for a short time until I can help fuel the love of the cosmos in some small way?

Today I will try to be of service to my fellow waffles.""

""5 and a half years sober and I'm miserable
I was one of those guys who was head over heels in love with the program. I went from a heroin junkie who had been in and out of jail and prison for 10 years, to a homeowner and addiction counselor, and my life just seemed amazing. I became a person I really liked and got married and had a little girl.  A couple years ago my marriage fell apart due to my mother-in-law committing suicide. My ex just lost it. Sadly, after 8 months of trying to fix the marriage, I was through with being lied to and cheated on. We got divorced and my ex relapsed.  She ended up abusing and neglecting my daughter several times pretty severely. Luckily I documented everything and was able to get full custody of our daughter.  My ex lives in another state now and has a new baby with her new boyfriend, and they both actively drink and use. Thankfully, my little girl is doing extremely well after several months of therapy - almost like nothing happened.  She is very smart and I get amazing reports from her teachers.  I am back in school full-time trying to get my Master's so I can provide the life I want for us.
After I became a single parent, my life changed drastically. Friendships fizzled out and eventually died, my social life is non-existent (obviously), and my meeting attendance and program involvement has stopped totally. I still keep in touch with people I care about from meetings but it's fairly superficial.  Every night she goes to bed around 7:30 and I clean the house and make her lunch for the next day and eat my dinner. And then the loneliness sets in. There's a woman I've been seeing for about a month who I care about immensely, and our relationship is great, but the times when I'm alone are so hard.  I find myself choking up and wanting to cry for no reason, or breaking down in tears at vaguely sad Facebook videos.  I feel very alone. I used to feel like I had dozens of people I could talk to, but now I feel like there's no one.  My group of close friends has been steadily drifting apart since one of our group relapsed and killed himself last year, and we don't talk much anymore. I don't feel like I can speak to my family about my feelings because I don't want them to worry about me relapsing. I have a lot on my shoulders and I just feel so isolated. I have told the woman I'm dating about a lot of this, but I don't want to constantly just emotionally dump on her because I have no one else.  It's a shitty feeling. After the extremely messy divorce, there was an adjustment period where I had to figure out how to do life as a single parent of a young child. It's possible that I just became very action-oriented at that point to avoid processing the pain of what had happened. And maybe now that things are smoother, the feelings are coming out. I don't know. I just know that I'm tired of feeling so sad all the time. ""

Lost his career in law, multiple DUIs, lots of time spent in jail, and finally a wife who had stuck with him for years before he burnt the bridge forever. Didn't have any relationship with his two kids for years. Anyway, he's finally gotten his shit together and started to turn things around. Speaking to his kids again, taking care of his body, and stringing together time. I asked my parents how long it had been and I was blown away to hear them reveal that it had been over \*5 years\* since he's drank. What the fuck!?

"Last Saturday was my 10 year anniversary of quitting World of Warcraft cold turkey
I was browsing my [Facebook ""On this day""](https://imgur.com/a/GpBkg) and stumbled across a status I made 10 years prior, celebrating ""beating the addiction.""  I know some think video games can't be an addiction, but at the time I was playing 12-14 hours per day, 7 days per week.  WoW cost me my fiance, my job, many of my friends, and even relationships with some of my family members.  I racked up student debt because I was completely living off of it, since I would skip work, or leave early to participate in raids.  I put on 60 pounds and topped out at  Even on the rare occasions that I would go out with friends, I would often be texting with other people I knew who I played WoW with (even though I didn't know any of them in real life).

I can distinctly remember my 23rd birthday, my fiance got a bunch of friends together to go out to BW3s for my birthday.  My guild had been bashing our heads on Vaelstrasz (second boss in Blackwing Lair) for almost two weeks, and were finally about to beat him.  All I could think about that night was how much I wanted to be there, raiding with my guildmates, and the loot I wanted to drop.  By the time I quit, I had right around 450 days played between all of my alts.  To put that in mathematical perspective, WoW had been out barely over three years by the time I quit.  That's just over 1100 days.  In other words, I spent around 41% of my life, for three years, playing that game.

Older, wiser me knows that you never truly beat addiction to something completely, you just win each battle one day at a time.  So here I am now, 10 years and two days clean.  Since then I've finished my bachelor's degree, become gainfully employed, I'm happily married, and have lost all of the weight that I put on, and been a part time CrossFit coach for the last three years, in addition to my full time job.  I still play video games, just far more casually now, and no more MMOs.  The itch to play WoW is still there; it's always calling to me, but I've made promises to my wife and to myself that I'd never pick it up again, and I intend to stay true to that promise.",Recovered

"I relapsed on Meth tonight after 8 months of sobriety.
I had gone around 8 months without smoking meth. Last time I had done it was around New Years, 2016. In these 8 months I have drank and I have smoked weed about 3-4 times, in social settings. A few beers doesn't seem to hurt, and I've scared myself straight (stupidly) with a DUI. I do tend to get depressed and drink to feel better, but I understand it's a temporary fix, so I now refuse to get out of control with that. Unfortunately, I feel as if I don't have a reliable group of friends. They all DO smoke constantly and drink constantly and it is very hard to be around them and feel like I fit in. They say they enjoy my company, but honestly I just feel like a shell when I'm around them and it's not my place to tell them that their habits make me uncomfortable. I should simply not be around it, but it is hard when I feel as if I don't have anyone else to be around.

But this is about the meth, mostly. I am losing my train of thought... I only had one hit tonight when I met up with some people to do the whole gay-pnp stuff. It is a ritual. I don't smoke otherwise, and it seems I have more than one addiction and now it looks like porn is really becoming an issue. Heavy porn use has probably contributed to this, but as well as not feeling like I am ""enjoying"" my sexuality as much as everyone else. I feel very sexually stunted. It just seems to stem all from such a young age. There's so much here that I don't feel comfortable posting but I have had an extremely strange and regretful sexual adolescence, to say the least. I just feel so alone. I'm looking for ways to put the blame on others but I am the only one to blame for the situation I'm in. I just feel so much regret. Suicide really is just a daily thought. I feel bombarded with negativity all around me on a daily basis and just the unforgiving nature of reality. I really wish I didn't relapse tonight, I wish I could have gone a full year. I wish I had felt enough satisfaction from quitting for 8 months that I would not have done it tonight, but apparently, I that wasn't enough for me.

I was 22 years old living at home and had dropped out of college, and had been in and out of jail. I had lost all my friends and and family except for my father. I finally took his last straw by selling his prized watch for quite a bit of money. I had the option of rehab or some lengthy jail time, and I chose to get help. I remember think people with 30 days were nuts but it's possible. I've lost many people since I've got clean to overdoses and suicides that could have easily been me.

"The promises do come true!
I have been in recovery for 26 months from an opioid addiction that lead to my being terminated from my dream job/career. My addiction was devastating on its own, but losing the job that was supporting my family was one of the worst repercussions of using. I'd gone to graduate school with the support of my husband (he literally paid for it and worked while I went full time) so that when I finished he could retire. And retire he did, 6 months after I started working. Things were going well for several years until my actions caught up with me.

The reason for my termination has followed me for the past 22 months. Every application I've filled out, I've had to list the exact reason I was let go (a requirement of disclosure in my profession) and that has led to nothing but rejection. It's been disheartening. We went into debt so I could go to treatment and we're still paying it off little by little. I had to cash out my retirement. I've been without health insurance (I was also covering my husband through my employer)--the list goes on, the absolute mess I made.

Finally--last week, an employer decided I was worth it. A second chance. I will finally be on the road back to success in my career. I've been steadily working on recovery during these past 26 months and every area of my life (marriage, family, kids) has improved so much--the only thing missing was a job. I was almost ready to give up.

I feel like I've been smiled upon at last for continuing to do the next right thing. I wanted to share a hopeful experience for others who might be thinking that recovery isn't worth it. It absolutely is.",Recovered
"My Drug Abuse Story
I have been getting caught up in psychedelics drugs recently, Shrooms, LSD, DMT, anything to keep me in that good vibe. I used these drugs as an outlet for my problems, issues, relationship troubles, anything that hurt me. I know that drugs are bad, and I continue to do them, I don't understand why I can't stop or get some help from someone, usually people ward me off, telling me to just continue and not worry about it.

"The Craving is a memory, and The Memory is a Trick.
Heard this from a drug counselor who ran group sessions for cocaine addicts for many years, and has seen every story or heard every excuse a hundred times over. 

He told me that no craving ever caused a relapse. Cravings are normal human behavior, and there is no way to stop them. It's the ""permission-giving thoughts"" that cause relapses when we give in to the craving. But you don't have to let cravings overpower you when you understand what they are. 

Cravings for food or shelter or sex are natural, and hardwired into our human brains. Those needs are necessary for survival and will always be there. The craving for cocaine is artificial, we have inserted it there, and it may never go away completely, but it will lose strength over time. 

Do not fear a craving, for they are bound to happen. Consider a craving to be a Memory, a recollection of how good it was to fill a need. And remember that for all needs, all cravings, the brain remembers that fulfillment by highlighting the pleasure, and downplaying the pain. This is an important survival instinct for humans, to remember, for example, how good the prey tasted while forgetting how dangerous it was to hunt for it.

The Craving is a Memory, but your brain remembers it with bias, telling you it was mostly good, and not much bad. For the human needs and natural cravings, this is good. For the artificial cravings for drugs, this is a trick. Because the pleasure of being high is not worth the damage to our bodies and the pain of losing our relationships. Remember that.

Do not fear the Craving. It will come, sure enough. But it's just a Memory of how it used to be, and the Memory is distorted to favor the pleasure and forget the pain. 

The Craving for drugs may turn up in a week, or 2 months, or 5 years, or 30 years. But it's just the Memory of an artificial need, and your brain is tricking you to forget the pain. Now that you can see how the trick works, you can stop falling for it.",NA

And while I feel overwhelming gratitude and accomplishment for this anniversary, it also feels just like any other day. 

I'm just hanging out at my apartment, which I rent with my best friend I met out here in the midwest. I'm hanging out with our new kitty on the couch, before heading to a job I love. I just went to a meeting a block from my home, a first step meeting, which is always humbling. 

I can't begin to describe how full of joy I am for all the gifts sobriety has given me. My family loves me and trusts me- they want to be a part of my life. I have wonderful friends, both ""normal"" and in recovery, and I can't thank them enough for everything they've done for me since moving across the country to get sober.

I'm taking care of myself, I work the steps, I work full time, I go on adventures with friends, I try to love with all my heart and let go of judgment, etc. etc., and when I romanticize the chaos that addiction brings, I remind myself that nothing compares to how good things are today.

"A moment of silence for those that still suffer, and those that suffer no longer
A little more than 4 years ago my family decided they were tired if watching me commit slow (but rapidly accelerating) suicide with drugs and booze. They had no idea what to do, so they called a rehab. The rehab gave them the name of a man who could help them get me to get some help. He was an interventionist. They couldn't pay him up front his normal fee, but he said not to worry, they could pay him what they could, when they could. He was scheduled to come do it on a Sunday, but they were so worried about me dying they begged him to come a day early, so he did. He got it all organized, helped them write their letters, got it all ready a day early. After they read them, he sat with me out back while I smoked and thought about the choice I had been offered. He told me he had been addicted to heroin and booze, and that there was a better way. He let me listen to Pink Floyd on the way to the hospital and helped me check myself in.

I ran I to him a few times, as I began to get my life back together. Then when I went to a meeting to take my 6 month chip, at an AA meeting at the hospital I had gone to for rehab, I saw him, wearing a patient bracelet. After 9 years sober, he had relapsed, only a three day run, but it had ended with him overdosed on a bus bench. 

I rarely heard from him after that. I'd heard from mutual acquaintances in the recovery community that he was struggling.

This morning my sponsor called me. He told me Jeff, my interventionist, was found dead in a flea bag motel in Tijuana. 

I don't know what else to say about this. I tried to share it on my Facebook, but those people don't really get it. They're all saying things like ""be strong"" and ""we're their for you"" as though this is a threat to my sobriety. They couldn't be more wrong. This man gave me the two greatest gifts to my recovery. First, he shared his story with me and convinced me that maybe, just maybe, there was a way out, and with his death he gives me a reminder that I must be forever vigilant, because no matter what, I will never be completely cured, it will never be safe for me to use drugs or alcohol.

Thanks for letting me share.",
"Took DMT and acid, had sex, ended up conceiving after a year of no luck.
I've been meaning to post this for a while because it's absolutely insane to me, but basically after about 5 times of doing DMT in a few month period, boyfriend and I decide to take acid and smoke DMT. (Note; we had been trying to conceive for about a year before because I had believed I could not get pregnant and therefore it wouldn't hurt to try.) On that night (3/8/17) we had taken the acid around 1 or 2am, then we watched Futurama and smoked weed until we both decided we wanted to smoke DMT since we had already peaked. We both sat there for about 30 minutes just staring at it, neither of us wanting to go first, waiting for the other to go first to kick it off. Then finally I said fuck it, I'll go first because I always do and to just jump. As he heated up the rig, I was a little bit more afraid/anxious than usual because I knew the acid would enhance the trip, but I calmed myself and knew it would just feel even more amazing than usual. Took my hit, held it in for about 5-10 seconds then blew it out, as soon as I smelled the smoke  I had just exhaled, I knew I was about to fucking be gone. Trip begins normally, taking me back to the different places I always go on DMT, the most bizarre but familiar feelings I have had. I see my soul and then all of a sudden I'm in a black void, with out a body, no solids as far as I can see. Then I see a sort of cluster of light emitting ribbons, there were about 10,000 or so, they were not taking up too much space in the black void. They all seemed to weave around each other, doing this beautiful dance without touching the others, yet they were also a part of one ""body"". Then I realized I was one of them, and I had an absolutely overwhelming sense of euphoria and peace and love and togetherness and unity. I remember thinking repeatedly who am I if I have no feelings or wants? Who am I if I have no feelings or wants? It was confusing but it felt so right I didn't try to over analyze it. Then I just was, there was no me, no I, no thoughts, I simply was. It was the most peaceful event I have experienced in my 20 years of life. Then I remember needing to lay down to just enjoy it, and as I laid down, I was taken through space and then I remember seeing my boyfriend looking at me kind of concerned and worried. And I remember having the feeling of wanting to be intimate, cuddle, sex, squeeze, whatever. He says I waved my hand at his crotch and he instantly got an erection (like magic or some crazy shit). And-then I reached out to him, grabbing on to his t shirt and pulled him on top of me and just held him and caressed him with much intensity, I felt amazing. I guess I began sort of grinding my hips in to him and he asked if I wanted to have sex, he seemed hesitant and worried, but was like okay?? And then we had sex and it was the most crazy, beautiful, pleasurable experience I have ever ever ever experienced. I remember just looking around, actually turning my head, and not knowing what to say besides ""Wow, it's so beautiful."" And it was just the best feeling in the world and I remember moaning ridiculously loud, but also just not caring at all because I fucking felt amazing. And then we finished and I sat in disbelief, thinking wow this is the sex people should be having! And during the trip, I saw myself laying facedown, and instead of my bed, I was on top of rock, sort of like cave material. And I saw myself from his perspective, the back of my head, but I had a headdress on, like one an Egyptian pharaoh would have, the beautiful Egyptian blue and gold colors. And after we had finished, he said he had seen the same thing? Like I somehow sent my trip visions to him telepathically or something. He had not smoked DMT, he was just on acid when that happened so I thought that was kind of crazy and weird. Then he took his DMT and I watched him, trying to remember exactly what had just happened, but disappointingly, not being able to recall all of it. When he was finished tripping it was around 6am and we just turned off the lights and tried to go to sleep. Fast forward, about a month later, began peeing a lot and breasts were sore. I instantly KNEW I was pregnant, so that night I bought a 2pk pregnancy test and the next morning I raced to the bathroom and did my thing, then in about 30 seconds (it didn't even take the whole 2 minutes) I read ""pregnant"" in the clear black font. I recalled that night about a month earlier and kinda just shook my head in amazement, I didn't even think I could get pregnant, and then I took that acid and DMT and somehow manipulated my boyfriend'a penis to get an erection in 1 second and we conceived that night. And I remember the DMT gods, looking down at us, as if they were observing to make sure we were doing everything right and I had an overwhelming feeling of approval and I had immediate assurance that I was doing exactly what I should be doing at exactly the right time. Now, I'm 33 weeks pregnant, due December 7th. Every day I look back at that day and try to comprehend it, but I never can and I accept that but I still thank the DMT gods every day for letting me experience that. ",Addicted

"I'm not giving up
I've written here before during one of my worse relapses. I'm sober this time. An hour ago I walked home from a nightclub. Left my boyfriend and friend to enjoy themselves and allowed myself to do what was best for me. See, I didn't want to drink. Hell, I didn't even want to do drugs. I definitely didn't want to be in a crowded place. I was already dissociating badly and feeling incredibly anxious to be there. My boyfriend told me I could get any drug I wanted, he thought that'd make me feel better. A week ago I would've been ecstatic about that. I would have fooled myself thinking that drugs could make me feel better. They don't actually make me feel better. All drugs have truly done for me is destroy me. That's what I wanted. It's all been for the most part to be self destructive. Even when it's been fun. Thing is I'm done hurting myself. 

I want to be sober. I've done cocaine, speed, MDMA, weed in the past month though. I've been continuing using just because I felt like I had to, if that makes sense. It took some time to understand that I actually don't want to use anymore. A couple of months ago I went on yet another crazy and long speed bender where I really messed up. Almost to the point where I lost everything. But I didn't. I was forgiven and given another chance. That changed something in me even though I'd done it all before. I guess this was just the last straw for me.

Last time I was high was last weekend. Smoked weed again after a long break. I've only smoked a couple of times this year. I used to smoke chronically. I wanted to know what it was like again. And oh boy, it was just too much and yet not enough.

Every time I've been high lately it's been either overwhelming or disappointing. I guess I'm over seeing drugs with heart shaped glasses, you know. Every day I've woken up sober again I've been happy and relieved to be sober. Even if I'm dealing with severe mental illness and my life is a mess I still am happy to be sober. I can't believe that this just happened on its own. I tried to force this change and turns out it just happened when I wasn't trying to force it. You know, for over a year I've wanted nothing but to be high. I used to be convinced that I couldn't deal with being sober. That it's awful to be sober. Well, turns out it's freaking amazing to be sober. To be in control of yourself is the best thing there is.

Walking home I realised that drugs can't give me what I want. I don't even know what I want. I've been looking for something my whole life, something to fill the void. And now I'm starting to accept that I don't need to fill it. Not like this, chasing madly after something I can't even define. All this time I thought I was chasing happiness, sanity, whatever. Now it's clear to me I've been chasing the exact opposite. I've been hurting and hurting myself, wondering why I feel so empty and broken. I've been breaking myself and continuing this awful cycle. I don't want to do that anymore. Be it drugs or other things, I'm done doing that to myself.


I don't want to fool myself with the idea of casual use. I can't do that. When I use I want to keep going until I pull myself inside out. Until I get to a point where I slowly but surely slip into another psychotic break. I get there even without drugs so it's time to stop doing things that push me there quicker. I don't want that anymore. I don't want to fall apart. I don't want to hit the bottom because I've already sunk lower than I ever thought I could and  I know now that I can always go lower. And I just don't want to do that anymore. I'm climbing back up every day. I'll probably stumble on the way but I'll keep going on. Even if I fall down badly I'll keep going on.

I'm not giving up. I'll be frank. A couple of weeks ago I had yet another suicide attempt planned. Been there, done that way too many times. This time it would've been successful 100%. Figured out a way. Ah but something changed. An opportunity to start a new life was offered to me and that was enough to make me fight against that urge to kill myself. It's not easy and I'm not really happy most of the time. I don't think that matters though. What matters is that I live. Every day I fight against this suicidalness in me. I know it will go away again. And come back. But I have control over myself as long as I stay sober and that's truly amazing to realise. 

I just wanted to share these thoughts and this change in me and this is the best place for it, I think.

Keep fighting.

Four years ago I overdosed for my third time. Four years ago I watched my best friend overdose and die. Four years ago I decided that I was sick of sitting in the back of cop cars, of spending time in jail, of burying my friends, of waking up in the hospital, of wasting away.

I wasn't sure I could ever get sober. I had spent two years trying. I had a year sober once upon a time and had relapsed hard after a failed relationship - a petty reason in the grand scheme of things, but I wanted any reason to return to my best friend. I decided I'd likely die with a needle in my arm. But four years ago I put that needle down and said that last goodbye to my friend heroin.

I did the impossible - or so I thought - and got sober again.
I stayed sober through long days at work, rejection from friends, fights with family, the loss of a job, mental health issues, loneliness, the loss of my first child. I never thought I'd stay sober. But here I am.

Hello fellow Redditors in Recovery, 

First time posting here. Hope you’re all staying strong and well, and for those suffering, hang in there and trust the process. Everyone is different and I don’t wish to drop anymore mindless motivational platitudes... just if you really focus on fixing one domain of your life at a time, things will improve, and they’ll start to improve exponentially quicker than you think. 

I don’t have too much to say, just that I’m on the brink of 21 weeks and I’m feeling back to normal. That is to say, my body has reached homeostasis, I’m sleeping well, and I’m not assailed by wild and volatile mood swings. Just the normal kind, good and bad days, all that. Summer is here and is the time of my greatest happiness and comfort, and I am grateful for every day that I’m not enslaved to 30mg Oxy pills.

One of the greatest things that’s helped me get through these past few months has been to engage myself in learning something. I play music as a hobbyist, and while I’m comfortable saying I’m pretty good, there’s always something I can improve upon, and to get lost for hours and to start seeing positive results from your efforts yields a very enduring sense of satisfaction. Time slows down, and also speeds up. It’s weird. But as long as I’m learning something, music, some philosophy, math, whatever it may be, I never regret the time spent. It makes me feel renewed I guess, like I’m in a process of Becoming something new.

I was about 6 months sober and the AA international convention was coming to a city near me. I was asked to volunteer and accepted because my sponsor told me to always accept commitments. My mind was always playing tricks on me though, so I was scared to buy a ticket to the convention because I was uncertain I could stay sober long enough to make it through 6 more months. I told a friend and he asked me the following question, ""did you stay sober today?"" I replied, ""yeah,"" and he said, ""well what did you do to stay sober today?"" I replied, ""I prayed, went to a meeting, called my sponsor, worked on steps, and tried to help others."" He responded, ""well do that shit tomorrow and you should be fine then, too."" Since that moment nearly 4 years ago, I've never worried about my ability to stay sober long term.

Very happy with myself right now!

It's been 10 days since I touched any substance, after a 45 day relapse. God damn, it's been so hard. So fucking hard. 

But, in this 10 days I've taken up crocheting and scrap booking, and have been putting much more effort into my job! With my new coping skills I'm excited for the future of sobriety :)

"7 years sober, and I'm sick and tired of AA
Anyone else get like this? I've been through the 12 steps and have sponsored a few people, but something is definitely wrong with my life right now and AA/the program just doesn't seem to give me any juice anymore. I'm actually hating going to meetings and if I reach to my friends and sponsor, I just get the same old cliche fucking responses that are driving me up the wall. I honestly think I'm depressed and need some outside therapy - I recognize that AA is a way of getting me away from drinking and is not a cure-all. Is it terrible if i just take a break from it and focus my life on recovery from depression? Fuck.

EDIT: thanks for all the help everyone, I'm going to seek out a therapist for sure. furthermore I'm going to start getting a few other things in my life that are lacking...like a new creative endeavor, some traveling, and some other spiritual practices that I've been watching help others (there's a few meditation/buddhist groups in my area, and I know some AA peoples that get a lot out of attending that stuff). But yeah, some therapy is needed for sure.",Recovered
"30 days clean today, graduated from my first rehab yesterday.
I transitioned into a sober living house affiliated with the rehab I just graduated from and I'm so excited, but it's weird going from complete structure to having to recover on my own. I got a sponsor a few days ago and I'm going to do 90 meetings in 90 days. Don't have a car right now so I have to reach out for rides which I feel weird about but I'm grateful for the opportunity I have and can't wait to start enjoying life sober again. Just discovered this sub after unsubscribing from all my drug/alcohol related ones and it's awesome knowing even on reddit, I'm not alone. Love you guys and remember, it's just for today.

"Christmas Day 2016 is my 2 year sobriety anniversary. I made a short list of things I learned along the way.
1. There is no such thing as rock bottom. I can always end up somewhere worse, unless I'm dead.

2. If I think to myself ""If x happened, I would get clean"", then I'm not really interested in getting clean.

3. I became a better liar, a better manipulator, and a better thief, when my addiction was on the line.

4. The first time I told someone, I didn't feel relieved, I felt scared. That fear never went away.

5. I didn't even trust my own promises, so how could I expect others to trust in them?

6. Recovery. Is. So. Goddamned. Slow.

7. Celebrate each day as if it were a 1 year anniversary.

8. A bad day sober is still 10 times better than the worst day high.

9. Planning for the future helps me forget about the past.

10. If they are still my friend, hold them close, thank them as often as possible, and never let go, because they loved me more than I loved myself.


I hope this helps you guys, even a little. My experience was different though. I was addicted from 2008-2014, on and off, where I would have 6-7 really bad months, then a month clean. I ran out of money, lost jobs, lost family. I ended up with a criminal record. The moment I decided to get clean was prompted by something you might see as silly... a moment with my aging and arthritic dog, where I couldn't help him get up the stairs because my arms were too weak. I know it sounds stupid, but it was in that moment I realized that I couldn't care for anyone, least of all myself, and I needed to change. No matter what your reason is, stick with it. Remember it.",Recovered

I can't believe I am at this point, but here I am! I've gained so much back in my life, and I really could not be happier. Everything has gotten tremendously better. My family trusts me again, I can pass any drug test without fear, I take care of myself, I have money in my pocket (amazing how much it adds up when you're not spending it on getting high!), I've got a girl who doesn't judge my past, I enjoy my passion for music again, everything is tremendously better. 

Just wanted to post some strength and hope for those going through it. It does get better! There are others out there who get what you're going through. Reach out. There's plenty of help out there. If nobody told you this today, I love you and I believe in you. Stay strong, stay up, and come join me at the top!",Recovering

"Three Weeks Clean Today!
I know it may not seem like a lot compared to other people's milestones, but I am so proud to say I've been completely sober for three weeks!

It all started with weed and drinking, which then lead to a benzodiazepine addiction and frequent usage of DXM. I was combining multiple drugs daily and was never sober for more than a day. 

Recently I overdosed on diphenhydramine (benadryl), and had to be hospitalized. This was when I finally realized that my drug use was not just hurting myself, but people close to me. I was lying and hiding things from my friends and family. I isolated myself from most of my family members and disappointed them immensely. 

This Subreddit has helped me so much in realizing that you really need to want to be clean to get sober. Like I said, three weeks is not a lot compared to others but I feel great. It's like a huge weight has been lifted. I just wanted to remind everyone to never give up! Although things may seem tough, you will turn out a better person in the end.",Recovering

"Eight years of Xanax and finally had enough
I was 18 when I decided to get medicated for my anxiety. Boy was I naive. I thought Xanax could cure it all when in reality I really didn't need it as much as I thought. I am an addict and the reality is that it was just another thing I could abuse.

I had ramped up to about 7mg a day rather quickly (all this being prescribed. my psychiatrist had extensive research into using xanax for relief of anxiety) . I have been on that regiment for around 7 years until recent. Reflecting on this time, people didn't know the true me anymore, emotions were sparse and I didn't even realize or care to realize even. I never had to deal with problems because I never saw anything AS a problem. This proved difficult with relationships for me. I was an emotional ""zombie""

In the past year I had slowly been weening off my 7mg a day down to about 1mg. I admit, I stayed in this range because I was afraid of what the world is like without this medication. The fear was too strong. I had become weak from not knowing what it is like to deal with everyday problems because I had become a zombie .I even got completely off it over the summer for about 3 weeks and had a pretty brutal panic attack and that's all it took to get me back on it. Back to 1mg and all that work was gone.

This year is a turning point. I had finally decided that enough was enough and I didn't need to rely on this medication any more.

I dropped my dosage to .5 for a few months before and finally quit all together on February 3, 2017.

The past 2 months have been a blur. A mix of depression and anxiety clutter my thoughts. Being completely off Xanax has been one of the toughest things ever.

Mainly large amounts of regret, seemingly stuck on remembering embarassing moments or regretful decisions. This is the hardest. It seems that I must relearn everything again, how to feel and react in situations. The inner monologue is ever more present.

My sense of smell and taste has dramatically changed. I notice a lot more details in every smell... every food. Some beers I've had I cannot drink anymore because of the intense flavor.

I notice things about myself I never noticed before, certain ticks come out. I am very sensitive to external stimuli, bright lights make me jolt. Sometimes I have jolts just out of nowhere. Loud / sharp noises startle me more. I attibute all of this to the withdrawals but am left wondering if maybe it is an unrelated issue I have.. I am irritable and my thoughts are everywhere (as seen in the writing above even, how much I jump around from thought to thought). Feeling crippled by anxiety I wonder if I'll ever get to a point where I do not have to let it control my present mindset. I practice being mindful and letting myself know that what I fear / regret will not help me in the present but just to try to learn from my experiences to better myself.

I will say that my anxiety spikes a lot when smoking THC. I have been smoking since I was a teenager and I guess I am now realizing what it really does to me. I am not sure if this will pass in time, but I guess I am slowly breaking away from my excessive smoking habits because of the negative effects of it. I get stuck in my head more than ever, finding it harder to break free of the spell of panic. I was reading another post and saw that someone had success with CBD so I think I will try that. I have had moderate success in the past with it.

I dont know what I'm looking for by writing this, or if anyone will even make it to this part. But I guess I just wanted to share my experience thus far. I just discovered this subreddit and, until now, I didn't have any way to relate to how I am feeling. I generally do not post at all about anything, but I am stepping out of my comfort zones in hopes that this helps me...or even anyone else for that matter. I am happy knowing that there is a place where I can relate to others on this road to recovery. I am leaving giant holes in my story but will fill in any gaps if anyone is interested enough. It's a long road ahead of me, but I just need to keep being patient with myself and remember to live in the present. Thank you for listening to my story.

"Three years clean and still white knuckling?!
I've just come home from my weekly meeting, and I'm feeling so lost.
We read step one from the green and gold tonight, I chose the reading myself. I'm three years clean and I haven't worked step one, or two, or three, or... you get the picture. 
Partly my problems with working the program have come from the lack of recovery community in my area, it's one small meeting a week and I'm almost the only woman, no ladies with more clean time than me to ask to sponsor me...
But mostly my problem has been a lack of commitment to what I know I should be doing I suppose.
I'm three years clean and I'm scared. I'm thinking about using. My addiction is rearing it's head in other areas and I can see that my relationship with food right now is mirroring how my relationship with drugs used to be. I'm trying to control my feelings and unmanageability with restricting food or overeating. 
And I can't share. I can't talk to my friends in the fellowship. I realised toight I have never really honestly shared and spoken about myself or my feelings.
I'm so scared and I feel like I'm falling. 
I realise this probably isn't the right forum for what is probably just a meaningless rant, but I wanted to talk to someone tonight, and I just couldn't open my mouth in the meeting, I hopes it's ok that I came here. I'm not asking for anything exactly, I really just wanted to share, and this was the only way I felt able.
My best to you all x",Recovered
